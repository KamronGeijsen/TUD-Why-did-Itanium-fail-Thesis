2005-12-26 - Year in review The race to dual-core   Year in Review: CHIPS The race to dual-core Dual-core processors--those with two processing engines--hit the mainstream in 2005. For years, chipmakers improved chips by increasing clock speeds. But physics and engineering problems put a stop to that approach as designers struggled to deliver sufficient electricity to power and cool the chips. The result: a course correction toward multicore processors that get more work done but at lower clock frequencies. It's a move that began in 2001 with IBM's Power4. But this year, x86 chips from Advanced Micro Devices and Intel arrived in PCs and mainstream servers. Intel initially asserted the push to dual-core chips "is not a race." But it eagerly trumpeted the arrival of its dual-core desktop chips in April. And by October, Intel hustled its first dual-core server chip to market, releasing a dual-processor server version of the "Paxville" chip that was originally designed just for four-processor machines. AMD, though, had planned for dual-core designs much earlier in the development of its Athlon PC chip and its server-oriented Opteron sibling. It beat Intel to the server market handily with dual-core Opterons in April--significant given that server software, already designed to run on multiple processors, is much better suited to multicore chips than desktop software. The Intel-AMD rivalry took a legal turn in June when AMD filed an antitrust suit against Intel. Apple Computer dropped a bombshell in June, announcing that it would switch to Intel's Pentium. The move required extensive software changes, but Apple said IBM's PowerPC processors just weren't meeting the company's needs. Apple's transition will be gradual though. The company's newest G5 models went dual-core in October with the latest IBM PowerPC 970. For Itanium, the dual-core news wasn't good. In October, Intel delayed its first dual-core Itanium model, "Montecito," from 2005 until mid-2006. Its successors, Montvale and Tukwila, also were pushed out a year to 2007 and 2008, respectively. There were also executive changes at Intel in 2005, as President Paul Otellini replaced Craig Barrett as chief executive. Even before taking the reins, Otellini launched an Intel reorganization in January that grouped processors with chipsets and other related technology components into "platforms." The company announced one of the first examples of the change in August, unveiling the Viiv brand for entertainment PCs. AMD also won another battle against Intel: lower power consumption. Its Opterons draw 95 watts compared with a range of 110 watts to 165 watts for Xeon. But Intel has a response in the works: a power-conscious next-generation architecture based on its Pentium M line for mobile PCs. That design will emerge in desktop computers and servers in 2006. Sun Microsystems, after years of processor products even the company admits were uninspiring, made major changes in 2005. In September, it announced its "Galaxy" line of Opteron servers, the company's first major in-house x86 server designs. And in December, Sun introduced servers using its ambitious UltraSparc T1 "Niagara" processor. Niagara has no fewer than eight cores, each able to process four instruction sequences called threads, and Sun is banking that it will endow its UltraSparc line not merely with relevance, but glory. One of Sun's biggest competitors, IBM's Power family, got a new member in October with the Power5+. But for another major rival, May marked the end of an era as Hewlett-Packard introduced the final member of its PA-RISC chip family. --Stephen Shankland 2005 HighlightsIntel launches broad reorganization Among the changes: a new division devoted to digital health care technologies, plus a unit to focus on Intel's distribution channels.

2005-12-19 - Year in review The PC chugs on Year in Review: PCs/SERVERS The PC chugs on The PC defied death again. Some futurists have repeatedly predicted the fading of the personal computer, but thanks to lower prices and emerging nations such as India, PC sales rose beyond expectations in 2005. And shipments of PCs will likely increase by 17.1 percent by the end of the year, topping 200 million units. Both Gartner and IDC had to revise their forecasts numerous times this year as consumers bought desktops and laptops more rapidly than expected. Prices played a big role. When Wal-Mart sold $398 Hewlett-Packard laptops in November, customers pushed and shoved to get into stores. And desktops plunged to below $300. Still, 2005 revenue is expected to increase from last year's levels, according to IDC, so not all the sales growth is being eaten by the huge discounts. The pecking order among the large companies began to shift during the year as well. Dell, an inexorable force for many years, showed signs of weakness. In the third quarter, for the first time in seven years, the company grew only as much as the rest of the industry. And Dell's customers continued to complain about support and service. Hewlett-Packard, meanwhile, began to return to fighting form under new CEO Mark Hurd. And Acer continued to be the fastest-growing manufacturer. Big surprises also came from the rest of the pack. Despite its merger with IBM, Lenovo didn't lose much market share. And Apple Computer announced it would convert to Intel chips and kept its place as the style maven of the industry. Meanwhile, what did consumers groove on? Notebook computers. Although lightweight notebooks remained popular, those big-screen jobs continued to excite a lot of buyers. For desktops, dominant themes were dual-core chips and 64-bit processing, but those technologies won't gain critical mass until 2006. Manufacturers also moved closer to bringing cheap computers to the developing world. Some of these machines will run on car batteries. Literally. As for servers, 2005 was sort of a replay of 2004. The Opteron chip from Advanced Micro Devices, along with 64-bit Intel's Xeon chips, gained ground while Itanium continued to wane. IBM increased its dominance in supercomputers while Sun trumpeted some accomplishments but did not reignite a comeback. But servers consume a lot of electricity and energy prices have continued to rise. So while Blade servers haven't taken over the world yet, blades and other energy-efficient technologies should enjoy a brighter spotlight in 2006. --Michael Kanellos 2005 HighlightsNew HP head was NCR's turnaround artist Hewlett-Packard got a new CEO this year, and few people in the industry knew anything about him.

2006-12-29 - Year in review Power problems plague PCs servers   Year in Review: PCs/servers Power problems plague PCs, servers Electricity is a computer's lifeblood, but after 2006, many in the industry probably wish they had steam-powered machines. Several PC makers reckoned with the public-relations nightmare of smoking, flaming and sometimes exploding laptop computer batteries. For server makers, it was the year companies tried to boost performance without crippling air conditioning units in the data center. The battery issue began in earnest in August, when Dell announced a recall of more than 4 million batteries made by Sony. Apple Computer followed with a recall of another 1.8 million, and the problem also hit Lenovo, Sharp and Panasonic. Sony itself launched a recall for batteries used by several other computer makers, too. Adding insult to injury, a resulting shortage of working batteries curtailed some fourth-quarter sales already hit by Microsoft's Windows Vista delay in March. On the server side, the industry took more serious measures to curtail heat problems. Sun plugged its UltraSparc T1 "Niagara"-based servers, which consume less power than typical x86 machines, and showed some success: in the second quarter of the year, Sun sold more than $100 million of the systems. That, plus $125 million in sales of x86 servers, were nice feathers in the cap of Jonathan Schwartz, named Sun's new chief executive in April as Scott McNealy stepped down. Server makers using dual-core chips had new heat issues when Intel began shipping the first quad-core processors in November. Meanwhile, IBM touted the energy efficiency of its mainframes and Intel boasted that its new Itanium 2 9000 "Montecito" Itanium chip, which arrived in July, sucked down less juice. At the beginning of the year, the greater energy efficiency of Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron chip helped the company make inroads against Intel's rival Xeon. Opteron rose to 26 percent of the x86 server market in the second quarter. Intel fought back with its Xeon 5300 "Woodcrest" chip, the first Xeon to employ the Core architecture. It quickly spread to servers from Dell, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, and helped Intel regain server share against AMD in the third quarter. Intel also congratulated itself for leading Apple through a faster-than-expected move to x86 chips from PowerPC. Apple, which turned 30 this year, completed its Intel-based PC transition with the unveiling of the Mac Pro in August. Intel's restored competitiveness wasn't enough to keep Dell's complete loyalty, though. In May, Dell announced that it would sell Opteron servers, models that it delivered in October. Dell also began selling AMD-based desktops and notebooks. Dell said it was changing its ways to meet customer demand. But in the meantime, Dell lost the PC market lead to longtime rival Hewlett-Packard in the third quarter. Both companies started taking the game market more seriously, with Dell acquiring Alienware and HP acquiring Voodoo PC. --Stephen Shankland 2006 Highlights Electric slide for tech industry?

2004-01-07 - Year in review Chipping away   Processors: Win some, lose some For processor manufacturers, 2003 was the best of times and the worst of times. On the positive side, several new processor designs were introduced. Intel released the Pentium M, a chip designed specifically for notebooks, while Advanced Micro Devices countered with the Opteron and the Athlon64, which can utilize 32-bit and 64-bit software. IBM and Sun Microsystems also agreed to sell Opteron-based servers, a crucial endorsement for AMD, which has tried for years to break into the mainstream corporate market. IBM, meanwhile, introduced a chip that can perform similar functions for the Mac market. A surge in PC buying, especially in developing nations, also boosted shipments after two stagnant years. On the down side, the cost of remaining in the chip market continued to climb. As a result, makers struck alliances throughout the year to share the costs of research and the building of fabrication plants. Additionally, Intel and AMD had to delay their first 90-nanometer chips because of complications. Designers also proposed new ways to reduce power consumption and leakage, the inadvertent dissipation of electricity. Strained silicon went into mass production and engineers said metallic gates and triple-gate transistors are on the horizon. No one, though, knows which of these ideas will eventually work in mass production. Alternatives to traditional silicon chips, such as processors made out of carbon nanotubes, began to gain more notice and more research funding. Still, keeping up with Moore's Law is going to be tougher and tougher, according to experts. --Michael Kanellos Semi survivalThe exploding costs of fabrication facilities, combined with technical hurdles, mean that chip companies will soon be dependent on friends in high places.

2002-12-28 - Year in review "Big iron" changes  Big changes for "big iron" Server makers break out the long blades. Although historically more immune to price fluctuations than PC makers, server companies could not avoid the harsh realities of the economic slowdown in 2002. Server sales shrank for the second year in a row while RISC-Unix manufacturers constantly tried to undercut each other in price. IBM and Dell Computer gained market share, at various times of the year, at the expense of Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems. The intense competition also forced consolidation, both commercially and technologically. Compaq Computer, long the leader in Intel-based servers, became part of HP. The move vaulted HP to the No. 1 position in the market and gave the company valuable assets such as the Tandem division. Still, the acquisition meant one less independent manufacturer in the market and will reduce the variety of technology because HP said it will phase out PA-RISC and Alpha servers over the next four years. Sales are expected to grow again in 2003, but the market will look different. For the first time, revenue from Intel-based servers will surpass sales of more expensive RISC-Unix servers. Intel servers currently account for more than 80 percent of the servers shipped in terms of units, but most of these have been one- and two-processor systems. The increasing performance of these chips, though, is growing in the four- and eight-processor market. Despite the economic chill, new technologies and architectures continued to evolve. Nearly every major manufacturer unfurled products, or at least plans, based on blade servers. These thin servers, mounted inside a rack and more easily managed than traditional servers, also became more versatile: IBM's blade rack in the future will accommodate networking equipment from Cisco Systems and other products. Meanwhile, the supercomputing market saw the resurgence of Japanese manufacturers. NEC's Earth Simulator, activated in late 2001, became the world's top performing computer. U.S. manufacturers began to benefit from increased funding for grid and supercomputing projects related to domestic security. --Michael Kanellos Sun debuts midrange "Starkitty" server The 52-processor machine, which plugs a gap in the company's product line that Hewlett-Packard and IBM were able to exploit, contains as many as 52 900MHz UltraSparc III processors.

2001-08-13 - Xilinx licenses communications chip design API NetWorks, a company that sells chip designs enabling use of the high-speed HyperTransport connection technology, has licensed its design to chipmaker Xilinx, the companies are scheduled to announce Monday. Through the deal, HyperTransport features will become "part of their standard intellectual property library," said David Rich, general manager of API Networks. Under the agreement, Xilinx may see and modify the design, he said. The deal highlights the growing adoption of HyperTransport in the networking market, where Xilinx products are most popular. Xilinx builds chips that can be programmed to perform a certain task, a feature desirable for companies creating prototypes or needing to bring a product to market quickly. HyperTransport, developed by Advanced Micro Devices but now governed by a consortium, has been licensed by networking and computing companies. The technology connects chips with a few high-speed wires, but API believes it could also evolve to include a connector technology similar to the PCI technology in all computers. AMD, Nvidia, Apple Computer and Sun Microsystems are interested in using HyperTransport within computers, but likely only to connect internal chips and not as a PCI replacement. AMD isn't interested in developing a connector for HyperTransport, and indeed voted in favor of an Intel proposal variously called Arapahoe or 3GIO as a successor to PCI. But API NetWorks is switching its efforts from being a server chip company to a network chip company, Rich said, and those customers need a connection technology. "It appears that AMD isn't interested in that, but we still see the people we talk to talking about a need for connectors," Rich said. API NetWorks' first HyperTransport chip is the AP1011, which joins processors to PCI connections. The company demonstrated use of the chip along with a HyperTransport connector technology two weeks ago, Rich said. AMD had considered developing a connector technology for HyperTransport but decided against it because of the compatibility-testing difficulties with an open design, said Gabriele Sartori, director of technology evangelism at AMD and president of the HyperTransport Technology Consortium. API NetWorks, formerly known as Alpha Processor, sold the Alpha chips designed and used by Compaq Computer, but Compaq is abandoning the product line in favor of Intel's Itanium family of processors. On Thursday, API NetWorks announced it would support Alpha designs through 2003 but that it's transferring employees to its networking chip division.
2005-02-18 - Xen lures big-name endorsements    BOSTON--In just a few short months, an open-source software package called Xen has been catapulted from obscurity to the limelight as many computing industry powers throw their weight behind the project. Xen lets multiple operating systems run on the same computer, a feature that's useful for extracting as much work as possible from a single system. The technology is common among high-end servers today, but on mainstream systems it requires proprietary "virtual machine" software from EMC subsidiary VMware. At the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo here, numerous companies voiced Xen support in the form of endorsements, programming help and software contributions. Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Novell, Red Hat, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and Voltaire all are involved, but one of the more interesting allies is IBM, which has decades of experience in the area. News.context What's new: A critical mass of corporate computing powers have endorsed the open-source Xen project, which competes with VMware in letting a single computer run several operating systems. Bottom line: Xen is being groomed for success with widespread support and software contributions. The result could be a standard way of making servers handle multiple tasks more efficiently. More stories on this topic "Two or three months ago, it wasn't on anybody's radar. Now it's going to make a big change in how everyone uses Linux," said Chris Schlaeger, vice president of research and development for Novell's SuSE Linux. The change illustrates what can go right in the world of open-source software: a project can trigger a cascade of cooperation by multiple interested parties. When it works well, as in the case of Linux, that cooperation can lead to a unified, fast-developing project rather than proprietary, mutually incompatible competitors. "The open-source community has finally decided to smooth over its differences and get behind one virtualization project, which means it's actually going to happen rather than having 12 warring fiefdoms, each with about two soldiers," said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. Xen began three years ago at the University of Cambridge in England, said Ian Pratt, project leader and a founder of XenSource, a start-up that develops and supports the software and is trying to make it a standard computer feature. "Being ubiquitous on Linux is the first step to that," he said. Xen and other approaches to dividing a computer into separate partitions rely on a concept called virtualization, which lets programs run on a software simulation of actual hardware. In the case of VMware, this foundation is called a virtual machine. One difference between VMware and Xen: The former completely simulates a machine, which theoretically allows any operating system to run unmodified on a virtual machine. Xen, on the other hand, uses "paravirtualization," which doesn't go as far. That means faster performance but also requires an operating system to be modified to run, Pratt said. Higher-level software, however, doesn't need to be modified, he said. The requirement for a modified operating system will loosen with Intel's coming Vanderpool Technology, or VT, due in 2005, Pratt said. It will mean unmodified operating systems will run on Xen, though not as fast as modified ones. That means Windows will run on Xen even though open-source programmers don't have access to change Windows itself. Falling by the wayside Xen competitors that haven't caught on include Plex86 and User-mode Linux. While the latter made it into the most recent version of SuSE Linux from Novell, it likely won't last. "User-mode Linux is most likely dead," Schlaeger said. The management tools Novell developed to administer that software will be re-used to control Xen instead, added Markus Rex, general manager of SuSE Linux. Xen will likely be incorporated into Novell's upcoming SuSE Linux Professional 9.3 and later into the next version of its premium product SuSE Linux Enterprise Server, Rex said. Linux seller Red Hat also has Xen plans. The virtualization package is being added to Red Hat's experimental Fedora Core 4 product and will probably be in version 5 of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, said Paul Cormier, executive vice president of engineering. Like Novell, Red Hat plans to add management tools to control aspects such as the creation or removal of Xen virtual machines. Hewlett-Packard strongly endorsed Xen this week, saying it will contribute software to the effort. "Our expectation is that Xen will provide a viable, open-source alternative in virtualization platforms," said Martin Fink, vice president of Linux, in a keynote address at the Linux show. HP, too, hopes to profit from software to manage virtual machines. Intel began contributing software to the Xen project in January so it could use VT extensions, said Phil Brace, director of marketing for Intel's digital enterprise group. Expanding into new areas Currently Xen works with Linux on computers using x86 processors such as Intel's Pentium, but efforts are under way to extend it into other domains. This week, AMD announced it's helping to bring Xen to 64-bit x86 chips such as its Opteron, future generations of which, employing "Pacifica" technology, will have new virtualization support. There's experimental support for Intel's Itanium family now in Xen, Pratt said. And IBM has expressed interest in moving it to the Power chip, Schlaeger said. Among operating systems, the NetBSD variant of Unix works on Xen--and the version was done so quickly, Pratt said, that XenSource hired the NetBSD programmer who did the work, Christian Limpach. And Sun's Solaris--which the company has begun aggressively pushing for x86 servers--is another likely candidate, said John Fowler, executive vice president of Sun's network systems group. "We think the open-source virtual hypervisor is the way to go," he said. (Hypervisor is a term IBM is trying to trademark referring to a layer of software that lets hardware be divided up so multiple operating systems can run on it.) The IBM connection Sources familiar with IBM's plans expect Big Blue to play a significant part in Xen. The company has decades of experience in the field with mainframes, Unix servers and Intel-based servers. Although IBM has a sales and development partnership with VMware, it also has an in-house hypervisor project for x86 chips--a project that came to light in a January posting to the Xen mailing list. Researchers in IBM's labs were using it as a foundation for a project called sHype, or Secure Hypervisor, to make virtual machines less susceptible to attack. The software uses rules that govern administrative privileges and the flow of information between virtual machines. "We now plan to contribute this to Xen by integrating our security architecture into it," IBM researcher Reiner Sailer said in the posting. Pratt responded favorably in his posting: "It'll be great to have IBM contributing to Xen security." That's not all. One source familiar with IBM's plans said the company expects to contribute software for two key computing technologies--input-output services for communicating with devices such as network cards and virtual memory for extending physical memory using hard drives. Despite the Xen support, IBM reaffirmed its VMware ties Thursday. "IBM has a strong and vital business relationship with VMware. That relationship is stronger than it's ever been," said spokesman Jim Larkin. VMware, for its part, labels Xen a "nascent" virtualization project that's hampered by its requirement that the operating system be modified. "Xen will not be very useful for the overwhelming majority of customers that have deployed standard Linux operating systems today," VMware said in a statement. But VMware--combined with Intel's VT technology and Microsoft's competing Virtual Server--faces a definite threat, Haff said. VMware has higher-level VirtualCenter and VMotion management software, Haff said, but the core virtualization product is crucial to the subsidiary. "It's where most of their money comes from today," Haff said.
2005-08-31 - Windows Server 2003 R2 nears completion    Microsoft said Thursday that it has reached the near-final, Release Candidate 0 (RC0) stage for Windows Server 2003 R2, an update to its server operating system. The software giant said it remains on track to release a final version of R2 in the second half of the year. Designed as a moderate update to the operating system, R2 is a paid upgrade, but by adding features while leaving the core of the OS intact, it's designed to require less testing. The update includes improved branch office and storage management abilities and other capabilities, some of which have previously been released as feature packs. R2 is based on the core of Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, which was released in March. Microsoft plans to release R2 for its standard, enterprise and datacenter editions and for both 32-bit and 64-bit x86 chips, but not for Intel's Itanium processor.
2002-09-10 - Windows makes a mark in server ranking A $4.6 million NEC server using Microsoft Windows has grabbed high marks in a closely watched performance ranking traditionally dominated by machines running the Unix operating system. The fifth-place ranking on the Transaction Performance Council's TPC-C speed test is an important step in Microsoft's years-long struggle to have its software used not only on PCs and low-end networked "server" computers, but also on high-end machines. Such servers often handle vital corporate computing tasks, such as tracking inventory or managing bank accounts. Expensive, high-end servers typically come with higher profit margins and often include sales of services and software. But these servers, sold by companies such as Sun Microsystems, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, usually run the Unix operating system, not Windows. NEC dented that Unix dominance with its $4.6 million TX7/i9510 system using 32 of Intel's new Itanium 2 processors. While the price tag might sound steep, it's a bargain compared with the top-ranked Fujitsu PrimePower 2000 server. This gargantuan Unix server comes with 128 processors and a $12 million price tag--and a 50 percent better score than the NEC machine. The NEC system is available running Linux or HP-UX, HP's version of Unix. The version running Windows .Net Server 2003 Datacenter Edition will be available by Dec. 31, NEC said. NEC demonstrated the 32-processor server Monday at the Intel Developer Forum in San Jose, Calif., but using a system powered by the next-generation "Madison" processors Intel plans to release in 2003. The Madison models are similar to their Itanium 2 "McKinley" predecessors, but will run at a higher clock speed and incorporate more high-speed "cache" memory for better overall performance. The similarity of Itanium 2, Madison and their successor code-named "Montecito" means that servers can be upgraded with the new processors for higher performance. Unisys demonstrated just that at the Intel show. The TPC-C test gauges server performance by simulating numerous people placing orders and performing other inventory transactions that take place on a database server. Though Microsoft has done well on "clustered" TPC-C tests that spread a database across several servers, that configuration is rarely used in the real world, and the "non-clustered" result is more closely monitored. In this category, Unix servers have long dominated. The NEC system posted a TPC-C score of 309,000. The result nearly doubles the previous top score for a non-clustered Windows server, a Unisys ES7000 server with 32 Intel Xeon processors. The Unisys server scored 165,000. Third place among Windows servers went to IBM, an x440 with eight Intel Xeon processors. It scored 92,000. Though Intel and Microsoft have been climbing up in the rankings, the Unix server sellers aren't standing still. HP posted the second-highest score, 423,000, in August, using its 64-processor Superdome Unix server. It's the highest score using database software. Sun has declined to participate in the TPC-C benchmark battle, calling the speed measurement obsolete and encouraging would-be customers to try its actual software instead looking at a generic benchmark. Analysts say Sun may be simply reluctant to spend the millions of dollars necessary to participate, especially if the company can't guarantee a good score.
2003-04-24 - Windows calls on the enterprise    Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer will officially launch Windows Server 2003 at a press conference in San Francisco. The company's customers have had the software since early April, when a code key capable of unlocking potentially tens of thousands of copies of the software leaked out onto the Internet. Microsoft released final, or gold, code at the end of March. Also on Thursday, Microsoft plans to launch Visual Studio .Net 2003, a new version of its development tools, and a 64-bit version of its SQL Server 2000 database server software. Microsoft will attempt to woo cash-strapped technology managers to Windows Server 2003 by touting the benefits of working with a single operating system, the advantages for server consolidation and the cost savings compared to Unix servers and mainframes. The Redmond, Wash.-based company plans to spend as much as $250 million over the next year promoting Windows Server 2003 in print, television, Web and outdoor advertisements. The software has been a long time coming. From conception to release of final code, it has seen four different names and four release dates. In October 2000, Microsoft said the product would ship in the second half of 2001. But in April 2001, it pushed back delivery to early 2002. In March 2002, it again delayed delivery until the second half of the year. In November, the company delayed delivery for a third time, setting the April launch date. Potential buyers also will need to navigate a product lineup that is more complex than with previous versions. Windows Server 2003 is available in seven different versions. The main ones are Datacenter, for top-end machines with dozens of processors and high reliability requirements; Enterprise Server, for more mainstream multiprocessor servers; Standard Server, for low-end servers; and new Web Server for low-end machines used to send Web pages to Internet browsers. Microsoft plans to release a fifth product, Windows Small Business Server 2003, in the third quarter. Also available: 64-bit versions of Datacenter and Enterprise versions for Itanium processors. Pricing for Windows Server 2003 remains largely unchanged from earlier versions, according to Microsoft. No rush to adoption Businesses evaluating an upgrade to Windows Server 2003 need to look beyond Microsoft's hype and carefully evaluate their needs, say analysts and companies that participated in an early-adopter program. For many businesses, the move to Windows Server 2003 will be slow, in part because of the frequent delays in its debut. Those delays have meant that customers such as Norwood, Mass.-based Analog Devices, which would have been a strong candidate for the new Special Report Buyer's market In making difficult spending decisions, cash-strapped companies are rejecting buzz and hype. product, moved to Windows 2000--an older version of Windows--instead of waiting for Windows Server 2003. Analog Devices is near the end of a switchover from the 7-year-old Windows NT 4 Server, according to the company. Peter Forte, data warehouse director for Analog Devices said, "We're just finishing up everything (on) Windows 2000. So we have some time before we bite off an aggressive plan to go to Windows 2003." The company, which makes specialized computer chips, would likely "start to (switch to) Windows 2003 in nine to 12 months," Forte said. "I wouldn't say that Analog is on the bleeding edge of adopting the technology." Analog Devices may provide a good representation of the market. IDC analyst Al Gillen estimated that "the majority of businesses would spend 12 months or more evaluating Windows Server 2003" before making the switch. Still, analysts said there are three scenarios that might call for a faster switch: server consolidation from Windows Server NT 4; server consolidation to Itanium 2-based systems from Unix servers or mainframes; and installation of other Microsoft software, such as SharePoint Portal Server or Windows Rights Management Services, that requires Windows Server 2003. Tough economic conditions and a large number of Windows NT 4 Server installations--about 35 percent of the total Windows Server-installed base--would help move along the most potential early adopters, say analysts. In both scenarios, server consolidation, either from Unix or Windows NT 4 Server, would be important factors driving new Windows Server 2003 installations. Michael Cherry, an analyst with market researcher Directions on Microsoft, praised Microsoft's efforts to improve security in Windows Server 2003. Last month, Microsoft executives said the company spent about $200 million on the security overhaul, which involved extensive review of the software code. "It remains to be seen whether or not the code review will lead to fewer patches," Cherry warned. Many Windows Server 2003 features are turned off by default, which improves security, but at a cost. ?Applications might initially fail due to tightened security, and other applications such as Exchange will require upgrades before they will run on Windows Server 2003," said Cherry. Windows Server 2003 is better suited "to run large-scale, critical databases and applications" than earlier versions, Cherry said in a report. "This in turn will allow organizations to reduce overall cost of ownership by consolidating many smaller Windows servers onto fewer, more powerful ones running the new operating system." The downside: Companies generally would need to invest in more powerful server hardware to take advantage of Windows Server 2003's improved scalability. Better PC management, which would let administrators manage thousands of Windows 2000 or XP desktops from one central location, is another appealing Windows Server 2003 improvement. "However, to reap the benefit of reduced ongoing PC administration costs, customers will have to make a significant upfront investment to plan and implement a Windows Server 2003-based network infrastructure," Cherry noted. Early test cases Companies that have already taken the plunge and upgraded to the new version of Windows generally praised the software's scalability and reliability. Ahead of Windows Server 2003's launch, Microsoft conducted a beta program for larger businesses interested in using the software on production systems. Chicago-based Information Resources provides sales and market research for companies selling consumer goods and pharmaceuticals. The company's 24,000-square-foot data center handles about 122 terabytes of information powered through mainframes, 115 eight-processor or greater Unix servers and 180 Windows-based servers. Special Report A mortal Microsoft Competitors and customers find cracks in the software empire. Information Resources is considering Windows Server 2003 in part because the company is moving away from 32-bit systems to 64-bit-based Itanium 2 servers. It is in the process of consolidating existing Unix servers onto Itanium 2 servers running the 64-bit editions of Windows Server 2003 and SQL Server 2000. Marshall Gibbs, Information Resources? chief information officer, said the company might not be as quick to switch from Unix if not for the 64-bit option. "The 32-bit environment wouldn't let me scale the models and offer the products that we need to be able to offer," he explained. "We have a 32-bit infrastructure that lets me get part-way down the path, but it's Microsoft's commitment to an enterprise-scale environment that's driving a lot of our decision making here." Gibbs said that he couldn't quantify the cost savings for two reasons: Information Resources is at the beginning of the rollout, and the company is adding capacity and power under the Windows setup versus the Unix environment. Gibbs said Information Resources? new servers running 64-bit Windows are more capable than are previous Unix systems, so "it's an apples to oranges comparison in terms of cost." The greater capacity means "the number of databases I host on a single server (increases) by 200 times and at the same time (the company can) increase the number of users on that server...ten-fold." Analog Devices also has found an important place for Windows Server 2003, even as the company focuses mainly on migrating existing servers from NT 4 to 2000. The semiconductor company used about six Windows Server 2003 systems to develop a business portal serving 8,800 employees. "The portal project was really a proof of concept for us more than anything else on Windows 2003," Forte said. New York-based JetBlue Airways could be the poster company for Windows Server 2003 and for standardization on Microsoft software. The airline is consolidating on Unisys 32-bit and 64-bit servers, with plans to run Microsoft software across the company. JetBlue chose Windows over Linux for its computing infrastructure. "If tomorrow, I put Linux in my environment, I would have to hire server people to build, monitor, maintain and administrate those servers, and I would have to hire a development staff to develop applications under the Linux operating system," said JetBlue CIO Jeff Cohen. "I would need 50 percent more staff to run...operating systems (other than Windows)." JetBlue sees the Unisys servers running Windows Server 2003 as a way of cutting costs, compared to previous setups used by the company, Cohen said. "We truly try to run a 100-percent Microsoft environment to keep the cost down, but if there are applications that we buy from vendors, whatever the required database is, that's what we run," he said.
2010-02-12 - Why Itanium still matters  It's been a long time coming, but earlier this week, Intel finally launched "Tukwila," the latest iteration in its Itanium family of high-end microprocessors. Intel Itanium 9300 die Intel Coming on the same day as IBM introduced both its Power7 chip and the first of an associated line of servers, Tukwila didn't garner as much attention as it might have otherwise. It's also true that today's Itanium is something of a specialty product. But that doesn't make it irrelevant. Tukwila will be the first Itanium to incorporate Intel's serial processor communications link (QuickPath Interconnect, or QPI) and integrated memory controllers. These features boost performance considerably and are standard fare for the current generation of server microprocessors. They also mean that the Itanium 9300, as Tukwila is officially known, and the Intel's upcoming Nehalem-EX Xeon (x86) processor can, in principle, be supported by the same system design. In practice, this convergence was a more interesting selling point in the days when Intel envisioned a broader market for Itanium processors. Nonetheless, it will still let Intel and its manufacturing partners take advantage of Xeon design work and dollars for Itanium. The specifics of the chip aside, though, it's not unreasonable to ask whether any of this matters. Given that both AMD and Intel's high-end x86 processors get more capable by the year, why does anyone need Itanium? Certainly, Itanium's market position today is not the one envisioned by Intel and Hewlett-Packard, when they first started designing the processor in the mid-1990s. They had conceived of it as a 64-bit processor family running Windows and (perhaps) a united Unix that would emerge as the de facto standard, when the time came to move beyond the increasingly restrictive memory limits imposed by 32-bit processors. The reasons why this didn't happen are numerous, and it would take an extended discussion to give them their due. However, some of the big ones include an overly ambitious concept; delays coupled with bad timing; a focus on instruction-level parallelism, when the world would soon move to more of an emphasis on threads; and AMD's introduction of 64-bit extensions for x86. Today, by contrast, just one company, HP, accounts for about 85 percent of the market for Itanium processors, with the balance mostly going to several large Japanese computer system vendors. HP uses Itanium in its Integrity line, for which it mostly runs HP-UX (HP's Unix) and NonStop (the descendent of Tandem's fault-tolerant operating system) applications. One company may not sound like much of a market but, in fact, vendor-specific processors were long the norm in the computer industry and only went by the wayside when x86 matured. And even today, IBM continues to aggressively roll out new Power processors, and Oracle says it plans to continue developing Sparc chips. Each of these cases is a bit different, but the basic point is that it's not outlandish to imagine that a major vendor's product line could support a unique microprocessor. But why would HP want to, given that this is a company that also has a major x86 product line? In a word: software. It is likely, perhaps even certain, that if HP could wave a magic wand, and have HP-UX and all its myriad applications run on Xeon tomorrow, it would do so. However, there is no such magic wand. The closest to such a wand, dynamic binary translation (DBT), works in some limited contexts. IBM uses it for certain Linux applications on Power chips, and Apple used DBT to aid migrating from PowerPC to Intel chips. But, for the most part, IT shops won't or can't use it for the sort of critical applications that run on HP-UX today. Indeed, HP developed its own DBT technology, when it was initially moving applications to Itanium in the first place, under the name "Aries." Few used it. It took many painful years--the better part of the last decade--for HP and its software partners to re-establish HP-UX's software catalog on Itanium when it migrated off PA-RISC. To start this process anew for Xeon is simply unthinkable. And even if the features of Xeon have largely achieved parity with Itanium, the same isn't generally true of the platforms as a whole. HP-UX is a mature commercial Unix operating system in the mold of AIX and Solaris. Linux and Windows gain in capability and robustness with each passing year, but they're not yet at the same point. The contrast with NonStop is even more striking. This is, after all, a line of systems that powers about 75 of the 100 largest fund transfer networks around the world. In short, Integrity brings a lot of money into HP, and it provides customers with capabilities that they can't necessarily get on Xeon-based platforms. And, in any case, HP-UX customers can't necessarily just pick up and move. Migrations take effort and money, and they have a degree of risk, even if the end state is ultimately a more desirable place to be. In addition to introducing Tukwila, Intel provided additional detail about its successor, "Poulson." Scheduled for about two years hence, it will skip a process generation and launch using 32-nanometer technology. This should bring it more in line with the then-contemporary Xeon processors than the 65nm Tukwila is, relative to today's 45nm Nehalem. (The process generation is significant because it's closely related to the amount of real estate on the chip and therefore to features such as the number of cores and the amount of cache.) Without providing much in the way of details, Intel also indicated that Poulson will have other architectural enhancements that go beyond simply being a process shrink. "Kittson" will be the generation after that. Plans can change, of course, and processors can slip. However, barring seismic changes, Intel sketched out a road map for something like a decade's worth of Itanium processors. I don't really expect these Itaniums to set a lot of performance records, but there's no reason to think that they won't be "in the ballpark." It's worth remembering that Sun sold lots of Sparc systems long after they had a "hot" microprocessor. The inertia in applications, skills, and general risk aversion in high-end servers is enormous. Itanium doesn't matter, when it comes to volume computing. It fought that battle and lost. But it remains an integral component in a major product line at a major systems vendor. And it remains a component that, in a world without magic wands, can't be easily replaced.
2007-06-27 - Which supercomputers rule  It was November 2000 when the first supercomputer passed 4 teraflops, or 4 trillion calculations per second. Now, that's the minimum requirement to even show up on the latest version of a list of the 500 fastest machines. Supercomputing, which pits the highest-end machines against challenges such as forecasting the global climate in coming decades or finding oil reservoirs underground, is a fast-changing field. The Top500 list, released twice annually at supercomputing conferences, has the most turnover compared with the preceding list yet, according to the researchers who compile it. Many systems on the newest Top500 ranking, set to be released Wednesday at the International Supercomputing Conference in Dresden, Germany, weren't on the list at all when the last one was released in November 2006. But one familiar supercomputer, IBM's BlueGene/L at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, again topped the Top500 List of Supercomputers with 131,072 processors, staying far ahead of its closest competitors by achieving speeds of 280.6 teraflops. The big change is Cray's Jaguar system, which leapfrogged from the No. 10 to the No. 2 position. The only two other systems to surpass 100 teraflops were also made by Cray: Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Jaguar, at 101.7 teraflops, and Sandia National Laboratory's Red Storm, at 101.4 teraflops. The total performance of all 500 systems reached 4.92 petaflops, or 1,000 teraflops. The systems on the November list topped out at 3.54 petaflops, and the June 2006 compilation totaled 2.79 petaflops. IBM dominated the list with 6 of the top 10 systems and 192 of the total 500, though Hewlett-Packard is actually the overall leader in terms of the percentage of systems. Forty percent, or 203 of 500, are powered by HP, but IBM's total teraflop sum is 2,060, almost double Hewlett-Packard's total of 1,202. Coming in at No. 5, IBM's New York Blue at Stony Brook University is new to the list, as is IBM's similar Blue Gene system at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at No. 7. Dell's Abe PowerEdge 1955 server, at the University of Illinois' National Center for Supercomputing Applications, made its at the No. 8 spot. The main measurement used in compiling the list is the Linpack measurement, which puts each system through its paces by having to solve a dense system of linear equations. The Top500 acknowledges it isn't a complete test of system performance, but it's a way to test for performance on a similar problem across each system. The need for a more complete benchmarking system has been under discussion for several years. Intel managed to increase its lead over Advanced Micro Devices in the number of systems using x86 processors. Just over half--52 percent--of the systems use Intel's x86 chips, up from 45.6 percent, while AMD's share shrunk from a 22.6 percent share to 21.2 percent. Intel's Itanium processors are beginning to move off the list, appearing in 28 of the 500 systems, down from last year's count of 35. The most noticeable change in applications of supercomputing is the rise in the number of systems used in geophysics, which rose from 23 in November to 37 on the newest list.
2003-04-30 - What's 64-bit computing to Linux   Unlike most areas of the technology business, 64-bit computing has somehow remained immune to the forces of commodity competition. Most 64-bit systems have historically been tied to proprietary operating systems. Compared with the more widespread x86, these systems only powered a small percentage of corporate computing shops and were relatively pricey. But with the introduction of its 64-bit Opteron processor line earlier this month, Advanced Micro Devices set powerful forces in motion. First, some historical context is in order. Itanium was the first operating system-agnostic chip with specific features to support Windows and Linux. The others were company-specific and thus, proprietary operating systems. Unfortunately for Intel, customer adoption went more slowly than the company would have liked following the Itanium processor debut in 2001. That was partly because the market requires choices. As author and venture capitalist Geoffrey Moore noted on another occasion, markets can't fully develop in the absence of competition. The recent introduction of the AMD64 architecture with Opteron satisfied that requirement. Without binding an operating system to their processors, Intel and AMD now present information technology consumers with a choice based on price-performance considerations. My guess is that this will free up the pent-up demand for 64-bit computing within enterprises. Big companies either are going to adopt or closely evaluate the new chips for future use. In a recent Evans Data survey of professional developers, 53 percent of the respondents said they considered 64-bit architectures to be important, while the same number of respondents indicated that they either are using or evaluating 64-bit platforms. The availability of 64-bit Linux across all of these architectures makes for particularly interesting possibilities. In the enterprise, Linux is now routinely implemented for applications with higher importance on systems ranging from x86 PCs to IBM mainframes. In a CIO magazine survey of 375 information executives, 54 percent of the respondents said that open source would be their dominant server platform within the next five years. These two trends--commodity 64-bit architectures and Linux--are intersecting. Five years from today, nobody in IT will be buying 32-bit servers (and maybe not even 32-bit laptops). They will buy 64-bit servers and almost universally run them with Linux. But in the technology industry, there is an old axiom that nobody buys computers--they buy application support systems. So it is that a few other important software components must still become available before things kick into high gear. All higher-importance IT applications are driven by databases, and thus software companies such as Oracle and IBM must deliver their database products for these newer 64-bit platforms. My guess is that this will free up the pent-up demand for 64-bit computing within enterprises. They, too, have been waiting for the 64-bit market to prove itself before making any major commitments. This should not take very long. Perhaps more than most other applications, databases benefit from 64-bit computing because of the need to directly address more than 4 gigabytes of memory. Other independent software companies also must port their applications. These apps include popular enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM) and other application suites. Since all 64-bit server systems now have a single, unified Linux operating system, the porting procedure will be vastly simplified. This also will provide a boon to IT organizations that already use UNIX or Linux and develop in-house code. They will have fewer problems moving the rest of their computing infrastructure to 64-bits. Might all of this help usher in the next generation of IT servers? That's something for which we technologists have been impatiently waiting. Now we're almost there.
2006-03-20 - Welcome to HP's third Superdome    Hewlett-Packard plans to begin selling a third generation of midrange and high-end Unix servers on Monday, in the first of two performance kicks it will give this year to the systems. As previously reported, the systems' Itanium processors are connected to memory, networking and other processors using HP's sx2000 "Arches" chipset. Arches boosts performance about 30 percent over the prior sx1000 "Pinnacles"-based servers, according to the Palo Alto, Calif., company. The Arches chipset is used in the eight-processor Integrity rx7640, the 16-processor rx8640, and the 32-processor or 64-processor Superdome. Those models will be available with the PA-8900 chip by the end of the year, after testing and qualification work is completed, said Manuel Martull, the worldwide marketing manager for HP's Business Critical Servers group. "We gave priority to Itanium," he said. The second boost to the Unix systems is expected in the third quarter, when HP plans to upgrade them with Intel's "Montecito" chip. Montecito is the first version of Itanium to employ dual processing engines, called cores. In addition, HP will upgrade the lower end of its Integrity line later this year, after Intel releases Montecito. It will replace the earlier zx1 chipset for these machines with a new zx2 chipset. "As soon as Intel announces it, we will be releasing a few weeks after the volume systems with zx2," Martull said. Switching over HP is partway through a years-long transition from its own PA-RISC processors to Itanium chips. The PA line ran only HP-UX, the company's version of the Unix operating system, while Itanium can run Windows, Linux and HP's OpenVMS as well. Though HP dominates the Itanium server market, customers also can purchase machines from second-tier server makers, including Unisys, NEC and Fujitsu. But delays, software incompatibilities and poor initial performance have hobbled the arrival of the Itanium family. That has led IBM and Dell to scrap their Itanium products and has made HP's transition slower than anticipated. The Arches systems were initially designed to debut with Montecito's release, but Intel pushed that date back from late 2005 to the second quarter of 2006. IBM took over leadership of the $17.5 billion Unix market in 2005, according to research firm IDC. It took in 31.8 percent of revenue, compared with 29.8 percent for HP and 26.2 percent for Sun. Although Itanium systems don't ship in large quantities compared with models with x86 chips or even with Sun's Sparc processor, the products are steadily maturing. For example, HP-UX on Itanium is now more advanced than on PA-RISC, with the ability to carve out operating systems partitions that use only a fraction of one processor's power, said Nick Van der Zweep, the director of virtualization and Integrity server software. HP is trying to blur boundaries between machines so that administrators can deal more with a pool of computing power than with several individual machines. In consequence, HP plans to make a significant change to its per-processor server pricing strategy in the third quarter. Currently, HP sells its servers on the basis of how many processors each has. However, customers can order machines with unused chips and pay only when those extra ones are activated, either temporarily or permanently. In the third quarter, with a feature called Global Instant Capacity, customers will be able to shuffle computing capacity from one server to another and so adjust to changing work requirements without paying a price penalty. Suppose a customer has two servers, each with 16 active, paid-for processors. "You can turn a CPU off in one machine and on in the other. As long as you stay at 32 CPUs or below, we don't care," Van der Zweep said. The rx7640 has a starting price of $43,500 for a bare-bones model with two processors and 4GB of memory. The rx8640 starts at $76,500 for a similar configuration. The new Superdome models are available immediately, but HP wasn't able to supply prices.
2004-07-30 - Week in review Worm nips at Google's heels The fast-moving MyDoom worm took some of the fun out of Google's pre-IPO festivities. Major Internet search engines were crippled by a new variant of MyDoom, which rendered Google inaccessible to many users and slowed results from Yahoo. Google representatives confirmed that the worm affected performance of the search engine. Despite numerous e-mail complaints received by CNET News.com that Google's search engine was down for hours, the company played down MyDoom's impact and said it had been not widely affected by the worm. The problems were occurring just as Google set the price range --$108 to $135 per share--for its initial public offering. The company filed Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise as much as $3.3 billion. MyDoom peaked after around 12 hours, but not before leaving behind a host of ancillary infections, including one programmed to launch a denial-of-service attack on Microsoft. Coincidentally, Google seems to be a popular tool in the hacker world. The search giant's ability to record Internet sites' content can be used to pinpoint those with weak security, Johnny Long, a security researcher and computer scientist for Computer Sciences, told attendees at the Black Hat Security Briefings in Las Vegas. Though the technique is not new, well-crafted searches turned up so many sites with vulnerabilities that even jaded researchers laughed during the session. Intel's missteps Intel said it won't ship a 4GHz version of the Pentium 4 until the first quarter of 2005, the latest in a series of delays for the chipmaking giant. A company spokesman said the delay will help ensure that the company can deliver an adequate number of chips when the product is launched. Intel also confirmed that its flagship desktop processor, the 3.6GHz Pentium 4 560, is in very short supply. Dell removed the chip as an option on its Dimension 8400 desktop last week, a Dell representative said, leaving the 3.4GHz Pentium 4 550 as the highest-performance processor available on the system. Though it's not a good situation for Intel to be in, it might not necessarily represent a problem with the chipmaker's manufacturing. Instead, the company may have been too aggressive in its estimates of its ability to ramp up speeds on the latest Pentium 4s. Meanwhile, a glitch in a separate Intel chip has hampered the launch of an important communication technology arriving Monday with a new generation of servers, sources familiar with the situation said. Intel and server partners plan to launch the "Nocona" version of the Xeon processor for dual-processor servers on Monday, but a supporting chip called "Lindenhurst" that handles input-output chores has a flaw that in rare circumstances can cripple the computer, the sources said. Product glitches and delays have become a persistent problem for Intel in 2004. The problem prompted company CEO Craig Barrett to issue an e-mail to employees warning of the urgent need to tighten manufacturing and operations. Peeling Apple RealNetworks says it has unlocked some of Apple Computer's most tightly held technology secrets, giving its music a way onto the popular iPod digital music player. RealNetworks has been selling songs from its digital song store since January, but the files could previously be played only on a few portable devices. The new Harmony software, which RealNetworks said mimics the proprietary copy protection used in Apple's iTunes store, is sure to be controversial. Apple has previously refused to provide licenses to companies seeking iPod compatibility, and RealNetworks did not seek permission before releasing its own version of iPod-friendly software. In a terse response, a "stunned" Apple accused RealNetworks of adopting the "tactics and ethics of a hacker" with the Harmony software. Apple threatened to block access to the iPod using Harmony the next time it updates the software used to run the device. Apple also said it is investigating the implications of RealNetworks' software methods under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other laws. The DMCA broadly restricts the bypassing of copy-protection technologies used in DVDs and in some music CDs and software programs. Turning from conflict to cooperation: Apple is working with Motorola to let customers of the iTunes music store transfer songs onto the next generation of MP3-enabled phones from the handset maker. Under the agreement, Apple will create a new version of its iTunes software for cell phones. The software will be the default jukebox on Motorola's new line of products, slated to hit the market in the first half of next year. Supersize supercomputers 'Twas the week for big iron to flex some muscle as the Defense Department said it would buy a 2,944-processor IBM supercomputer for naval simulations. The system, called Kraken, will have an expected performance of about 20 trillion calculations per second, or 20 teraflops. It's one of two machines the Naval Oceanographic Office is buying in a deal IBM said is worth tens of millions of dollars. The flagship system is a cluster of 386 eight-processor p655 machines, which use IBM's Power4+ processor and its AIX version of Unix, according to IBM. It also includes a 55-terabyte FastT storage system. The second and smaller supercomputer, with 64 eight-processor p655 systems, has a speed of 3.5 teraflops. Meanwhile, NASA picked computer maker Silicon Graphics Inc. and chipmaker Intel to develop a supercomputer based on Linux to simulate space exploration and conduct other research. The computer company said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to integrate twenty 512-processor SGI Altix systems using Intel's Itanium 2 processors. With an eventual 10,240 processors, the Space Exploration Simulator will be among the world's largest supercomputers based on the Linux operating system.

2003-04-11 - Week in review Windows cracks  Microsoft revealed some of its coveted Windows source code as part of an effort to stave off open-source competitors, but a backdoor leak at the software maker released a different type of code that is sure to please pirates. A key code for installing Microsoft's Windows Server 2003 leaked onto the Internet, a loss that could lead to widespread piracy of the software. Microsoft confirmed the leak and said it was investigating the matter. The leaked code appears to be from a Microsoft corporate customer that subscribes to one of the company's volume-licensing programs. The Microsoft representative made clear that the company will scour the Internet looking for the leaked code. "Our legal department works aggressively on that kind of thing," the representative said. In a more planned and controlled release, Microsoft plans to let device makers modify more of the source code of its specialized Windows CE operating system. But some say the company's licensing terms could kill interest in the plan. The expanded "shared source" program will give manufacturers access to the operating system's source code and an opportunity to modify it. But analysts argue that manufacturers already had access to the source code and the ability to modify it. Under the terms, manufacturers could be compelled to license some changes back to Microsoft, which would get those changes without paying royalties. Microsoft also warned of three flaws affecting its software, the most serious of which would allow an attacker to gain full control of a PC using Java applets. The warnings are related to the Microsoft Virtual Machine for running Java applets on Windows; a cross-site scripting bug in a component of Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0; and a denial-of-service bug affecting Proxy Server 2.0 and ISA Server. The Virtual Machine flaw is the most serious, meriting a "critical" rating from Microsoft. This malicious applet, which could be delivered via a Web page or an e-mail, could allow the attacker to run code on the PC, doing anything from erasing the hard drive to implanting a "back door" leaving the machine vulnerable to future attacks. IM goes to the office As instant messaging popularity grows in the workplace, many enterprise software companies are trying to sell IM services that include more features for corporate IT management. Sun Microsystems released a new version of its enterprise business-oriented instant messaging software as part of an overall unveiling of a communications software package. Called the Sun Open Network Environment (Sun ONE) Collaborative Business Platform, the product combines e-mail and calendaring with Sun ONE Instant Messaging 6.0, the latest version of its enterprise IM software that includes security, wireless access, search and archiving features. Microsoft turned up the heat by announcing that its Greenwich software will be renamed Microsoft Real Time Communications Server 2003, which it plans to roll out in the first half of the third quarter. The new moniker describes the company's intent to provide real-time communications functions for the enterprise. Microsoft has said that future versions of the software will offer Internet phone calling, video conferencing and e-mail. The company believes that the Real Time Communications Server can manage all of these features for companies, while allowing developers to write software to run on top of Microsoft's product. Yahoo, on the other hand, is trying to maintain the status quo, and is tapping its millions of IM users in hopes of ending what it says is a trend among corporate technology managers to ban the popular product at work. The Web portal's "Save Smiley" campaign which launched in certain areas of Yahoo, asks users to inform Yahoo if a company has blocked instant messaging in the workplace. The Web giant plans to then approach these companies and to try to sell its enterprise IM service to their information technology departments. Apple cuts Dell Computer stopped selling Apple Computer's iPod music player after only six months, bringing to an end an unusual marriage of marketing convenience. Meanwhile, the 5GB iPod is fading further into the sunset. Dell started selling the iPod last October through its online store, which carries a variety of products from third-party manufacturers and developers as a way to round out its product lineup. The iPod relationship ended at the beginning of the month. A Dell representative said the company was "currently not authorized to sell iPods. You currently cannot buy an iPod from us." Sources said the change came about because of alterations to Apple's reseller contract. It looks as though Dell wasn't alone, either. A number of Apple's resellers are no longer authorized to sell Macs as of April 1, following a shake-up that occurred during the company's annual renewal process. Apple declined to provide a list of all of the resellers that are no longer authorized, but said that the dealers that were not renewed accounted for less than 1.5 percent of sales last year. Some of the dealers affected said they were unhappy with new clauses inserted by Apple into its contract, including one that gave Apple the right to inspect its resellers' business records even after a dealer was no longer selling the company's products. Apple also lowered the price of its eMac to $699, but for most consumers the new price may prove strictly academic. That's because the price cut, which went into effect last week, applies only to customers at Apple's education store. Individuals who claim an affiliation with a school, such as students and teachers, can get an eMac for $779, while those purchasing the all-in-one computers on behalf of a school can get them for $699. Education pricing for the eMac used to start at $849 for institutional buyers, according to Apple. http://news.com.com/2100-1042-996194.html?tag=nl In the chips Microsoft is betting on two horses in the 64-bit processor race. The software giant plans to deliver two specialized versions of Windows for Advanced Micro Devices' forthcoming 64-bit processors--much as it did for Intel. In March, Microsoft released both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Server 2003 to PC manufacturers for Intel chips, including the Xeon and Itanium 2. It also released a 64-bit version of Windows XP for Itanium 2 workstations. Now Microsoft will offer a 64-bit version of Windows Server 2003 for AMD's Opteron server chip. Sun will likely adopt Opteron as it extends into new branches of the server market. Sun has been testing the forthcoming Opteron chip for servers in its labs, and has found interest for the chip among customers. One executive said the chip, which comes out April 22, would probably end up in a Sun product. "Can we commit to using Opteron today? No. Can we use it? Are we likely to use it? Yes." The probable endorsement from Sun is one of the strongest yet for the upcoming chip. Intel and Via Technologies settled all of the lawsuits pending between them and entered into an agreement that will let Via manufacture processors and chipsets and let Intel collect royalties. The settlement--which involves 11 cases filed in five countries--will essentially make it far easier for Via to sell processors and chipsets to PC makers. Intel claimed that the Taiwanese company's products infringed on its intellectual property and that Via did not have a valid patent license to make them. Under patent law, any PC maker that used Via's chips could have been sued on the same ground.

2004-01-30 - Week in review Virus king  All eyes were on security as a fast-moving e-mail virus claimed the crown as the worst ever, and along the way it managed to make enemies of two software heavyweights. MyDoom raced onto the Internet on Monday, quickly clogging e-mail servers, as it propagated itself with millions of messages laden with malicious software code. The virus arrived with one of several different random subject lines, such as "Mail Delivery System," "Test" or "Mail Transaction Failed." Once the virus infects a Windows-running PC, it installs a program that allows the computer to be controlled remotely. The program primes the PC to send data to the SCO Group's Web server, starting Sunday. SCO quickly offered $250,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or group responsible for creating MyDoom virus. The virus also copies itself to the Kazaa download directory on PCs, on which the file-sharing program is loaded. The virus camouflages with one of seven file names: Winamp5, icq2004-final, Activation_Crack, Strip-gril-2.0bdcom_patches, RootkitXP, Officecrack and Nuke2004. An offshoot of MyDoom soon emerged, aiming data attacks at Microsoft's Web site and interfering with an infected PC's ability to access downloadable security-software updates. Microsoft followed SCO's lead and announced a $250,000 reward of its own The reward is the third time Microsoft has posted a $250,000 "Wanted" sign on the Internet. It offered the same amount for information leading to the capture and conviction of the persons or groups responsible for releasing the MSBlast worm and the Sobig.F virus. Two days after the attacks began, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced an e-mail alert system aimed at informing two groups of citizens--technical experts and the average home user--of potential online threats. The system, known as the National Cyber Alert System, will be maintained and administered by the U.S. national computer emergency response team, or US-CERT, but it relies on the expertise of many security companies. The alert system is the United States' first nationally coordinated warning system for Internet threats and vulnerabilities. The system will take information from a variety of public and private sources and issue warnings, bulletins and how-to notifications. Browser beef Microsoft is making some changes to Explorer to better protect Web surfers, but holding off previously announced changes because of a patent dispute. Microsoft will release a software update to Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer designed to protect Web surfers from being lured to Web sites that might contain malicious code. In December, a Danish security firm alerted the security community to an IE bug that would let hackers display false Web addresses. This week, the company posted details of an alleged flaw that could let Web surfers be tricked into downloading malicious files from counterfeit sites reached via such fake addresses. However, Microsoft will delay making any modifications to Windows and Internet Explorer Web browser, based on the Eolas patent case. Microsoft said it will hold off on implementing previously announced changes until its efforts to appeal the suit or invalidate the patent are settled. Microsoft originally said it would make minor tweaks to IE and Windows XP to bypass some of the disputed technology, but it backed off those plans. Microsoft said the proposed tweaks could inconvenience Web developers and other software companies and may not be necessary, if the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office invalidates Eolas' patent. Cooking spam The battle to rid the world's in-boxes of spam has got itself a heavyweight champion--Bill Gates--making an even more heavyweight promise: an end to the e-mail plague within two years. Gates said he could crack spam by 2006, adding that with the help of some canny tech measures, spammers would be hit where it hurts--in their fat wads of Viagra-inspired cash. One of the suggestions on Gates' antispam checklist is setting those sending e-mails a simple brainteaser, or asking their PCs to do an easy computation. If you're sending an odd e-mail or two, the time and difficulty wouldn't pose much of a problem. For machines belching out huge amounts of spam day in and day out, however, the cost and computing power needed to send the e-mails off through the ether would be huge. The Federal Trade Commission has some ideas of its own on how to get rid of unsolicited e-mail. The commission proposed a mandatory tag for commercial e-mail that contains pornographic material--a stipulation of the new federal antispam law enacted this month. The FTC proposed a rule that would require senders of adult-related e-mail to include the phrase, "Sexually-Explicit-Content:" in the messages. That way, recipients would be able to recognize and easily filter such e-mail before viewing it, according to the FTC and backers of the law. The FTC also has some advice for network administrators: Secure your servers. The FTC and its counterparts in 26 other nations began sending e-mail to tens of thousands of people believed to be responsible for open relays and open proxies that spammers use as broadcast points for massive amounts of junk mail. This represents an escalation of the FTC's efforts to close open relays, which began last May with notices to operators of more than 1,000 servers. An open relay is a mail server configured so that anyone can use it as a relay point for mail to any recipient. Looking at Longhorn As Microsoft readies Longhorn--the next version of Windows--the company wants to wean developers and independent software vendors off older Windows programming models. Microsoft software architect Don Box said the company will not invest much more in Component Object Model and Distributed Compound Object Model--Microsoft's mechanisms for sharing objects between programs. Instead, Box said, programs will use managed services based on the Extensible Markup Language to communicate with each other. Box is leading the work on the "plumbing" part of Longhorn, called "Indigo," which is effectively the successor to Microsoft .Net and as such will dictate how programs are written in future Windows platforms. Box's boss--Microsoft chief software architect Bill Gates--took a swipe at rival operating systems as he reiterated the importance of security for Windows and in particular for the upcoming Longhorn. Gates stressed the importance of security for his company's products but said companies such as SCO were courting danger by sitting back. "To say a system is secure because no one is attacking it is very dangerous," said Gates, referring to operating systems that have a smaller share of the desktop market, such as Apple Computer's Macintosh OS and the open-source software Linux. Besides Longhorn, Microsoft plans to start testing a new version of its Windows XP Media Center edition, a customized OS designed for entertainment-oriented PCs. The software, code-named Symphony, is likely to make its way later this year onto new entertainment-oriented PCs. Media Center includes all the features of Windows XP, but adds a second interface that can be navigated by remote control, for doing tasks like playing music, viewing digital pictures and pausing or recording TV shows.

2004-11-12 - Week in review The love of the game    They risked hypothermia and fought off the effects of sleep deprivation so they could be among the first to achieve their quest in the wee hours of the morning. Was it worth it? Computer game enthusiasts will tell you it was. Nearly six hours before the release of "Halo 2"--the follow-up to the most successful title ever released for Microsoft's Xbox--more than 200 hard-core gamers stood in line near San Francisco's Union Square to buy a copy of the $49.99 game. The long lines were duplicated in major cities across the United States. CLICK HERE: PHOTOS Many in the crowd said they simply didn't want to wait any longer than they had to and were eager to hear the gunshots of this first-person shooter game. That's likely music to the ears of console makers and game publishers, who this holiday season will be looking to capitalize on the rapidly growing game industry, which is challenging the popularity of the movie industry. Microsoft was the clear early winner, beating even its own heady expectations on the way to selling more than $125 million of the product on its first day in stores. The software giant reported sales of 2.38 million units for the game in the first 24 hours. Microsoft is deriving another benefit from "Halo 2." The software giant is apparently using the game to help crack down on the use of modified Xbox consoles. Hundreds of Xbox owners have reported in online forums in recent days that they were banned from Xbox Live, Microsoft's online gaming service, after trying to play "Halo 2" online with a modified console. A Microsoft representative would not specify which additional security measures, if any, have been added to Xbox Live around the "Halo 2" launch. "Microsoft listens carefully to the Xbox Live community and reserves the right to take steps necessary to preserve the integrity of the user experience," the representative said in a statement. Meanwhile, bits and pieces of Valve Software's "Half-Life 2"--another of the year's most hotly anticipated computer games--have been trickling onto nearly 2 million computers around the world for weeks now. "Half-Life 2" won't be out until next week, but Valve's new broadband content distribution network, called Steam, has been slowly loading players' computers with the game so they'll have it at their fingertips the moment it's released. The network, which has been used to a lesser extent during the past few years to distribute updates and less-anticipated games, is getting its toughest market test with "Half-Life 2." By selling the games directly over the Net, the company is experimenting with a model that could substantially transform the video game business, which now rivals Hollywood in annual revenue. But the network has also gotten Valve into hot water with Sierra Entertainment. Sierra is the Vivendi Universal subsidiary that is publishing the "Half-Life 2" game, but Sierra doesn't get the same cut of copies that are distributed online. Even as they jointly promote the new game, the companies are locked in a court battle over the broadband network that could help shape the increasingly profitable game world for years to come. Taking the Web by Firefox After 19 months of development, two name changes and more than 8 million downloads of its preview release, the Firefox browser finally turned 1.0. Firefox, a browser based on the Mozilla Foundation's open-source development work, was made available for free download early Tuesday. Firefox 1.0 isn't significantly different from the preview releases that have been launched in recent months. Mozilla changed its default start page to appeal to new users, but other changes are minor performance improvements and bug fixes. The release could nonetheless have a big effect if prerelease trends propel the open-source browser into serious contention with Microsoft's Internet Explorer. And the Mozilla Foundation is already cooking up its next moves to challenge IE's dominance. Now that it has the Firefox 1.0 milestone under its belt, the foundation has identified three areas for future growth and development: cell phone and small-device browsing, desktop search integration, and OEM (original equipment manufacturer) distribution. "It's been a tremendous year, and we can't see anything but upside the way things are heading right now," said Chris Hofmann, the Mozilla Foundation's director of engineering. "We're just starting the planning for the initiatives that are going to be important in the coming year." But Microsoft says it doesn't feel threatened by Firefox. Just days after the launch of Firefox 1.0, Microsoft executives defended IE, saying it is no less secure than other browsers and doesn't lack any important features. At a security roundtable discussion in Sydney, Australia, on Thursday, Ben English, Microsoft's security and management product manager, told attendees that IE undergoes "rigorous code reviews." "Because IE is ubiquitous, you hear a lot more about it, but I don't think that Internet Explorer is any less secure than any other browser out there," English said. Making the call The Federal Communications Commission ruled 3-2 that states are now barred from imposing telecommunications regulations on Internet phone providers, which treat calls no differently than any other application on the Internet. That class of operators includes Vonage Holdings, which asked the FCC for just such a designation in May, plus Verizon Communications, AT&T and dozens of other commercial Internet providers, according to those familiar with the FCC's thinking. "This landmark order recognizes a revolution has occurred," FCC Chairman Michael Powell said at a meeting in Washington, D.C. The FCC's decision was a general one, was widely anticipated, and answers just one of dozens of questions about how regulators will ultimately treat Internet phone services, typically referred to as voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP. The decision came just after a last-minute attempt by two Southern California cities to tax Internet phone calls, a potentially nightmarish problem for Net phone providers that surfaced just as federal utility regulators were expected to make things easier for them. The cities, Burbank and El Monte, have asked dozens of Internet phone service providers to collect a monthly fee of about $1.40 from each subscriber that claims his "place of primary use" is within their cities. The tax would be similar to what traditional phone providers pay. Another development came in the form of an adapter made by Siemens that extends Internet access to cordless phones and is now loaded with Skype Net phone software, allowing the same phone to make calls using either the Internet or the traditional phone network. The coupling of Internet and traditional telephony in a single phone is hard to find now, but it could become more common in years to come if, as expected, more calls flow over the Internet. In and out at Intel In a widely expected move, Intel's board voted to elevate Paul Otellini from president to CEO in May. Otellini, 54, who is also Intel's chief operating officer, will succeed Craig Barrett, 65, Intel's fourth CEO. Barrett had said earlier this year that he will step down as Intel's top executive. Intel's next CEO,Paul Otellini Although Otellini is already deeply involved in Intel's day-to-day operations and its product plans, he'll have his work cut out for him during 2005. The next year or so is expected to be a period of transition for the company's products and management. Next year will be the real test of the strategy, as Intel will begin a move to dual-core processors, which will incorporate two processor cores into one chip. The company will also begin to deliver more feature-laden single-core chips. One challenge for Intel was created when Microsoft announced it would come out with a special version of Windows next year for clusters, but it won't run on Intel's most powerful server chip, the Itanium 2, at least for now. Instead, the new Windows software--a version of Microsoft's flagship operating system for clusters containing up to 128 processors--will run on 32-bit/64-bit server chips from Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. The decision not to support Itanium 2 is the latest slap in the face for the chip family that 10 years ago threatened to take over the world. Last month, Hewlett-Packard terminated its line of Itanium 2 workstations. However, the chip is building momentum among heavy-duty computer users. In the most recent list of the top 500 supercomputers, the number of Itanium-based systems grew from 61 to 87.

2002-11-29 - Week in review Scuttling the pirates   The file-swapping seas are getting rougher for digital music pirates, with potential blockades coming from Internet service providers and the courts. File-swapping via services such as Napster and Kazaa has been among the most popular activities on high-speed Internet service providers' networks. As a result, some dedicated file-swappers, known as "bandwidth hogs," account for a hugely disproportionate amount of network traffic. Now many of the biggest high-speed ISPs are considering putting a cap on the amount of bandwidth that their subscribers can use per month. The move could undermine subscribers' free swapping ways--something that many lawsuits have not been able to achieve. If people know they have a limited amount of bandwidth available, they'll be less likely to download voraciously or to allow people to upload songs and music from their computers. In a closely watched initiative, Bell Canada's has put caps on its DSL (digital subscriber line) service, limiting the amount of bandwidth its subscribers can use each month. Meanwhile, a Los Angeles federal judge heard arguments as to whether record companies and movie studios can sue the parent company of Kazaa, the most popular online file-swapping service, in the United States. Much of Kazaa's future hangs on the judge's decision. The parent company, Sharman Networks, is headquartered in Australia and incorporated in the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, and has tried to keep business contact with the United States to a minimum in order to decrease its legal risk. If a judge says Sharman can be sued in the United States, Kazaa will get sucked into the same legal maelstrom that has grabbed Napster, Aimster, Audio Galaxy, Grokster and Morpheus, closing some of the popular services and threatening the existence of the others. The Kazaa case is the biggest yet in the recent copyright wars that have been testing the international reach of U.S. courts. A smaller skirmish broke out recently when the U.S. Naval Academy seized about 100 student computers that are suspected of containing unauthorized copies of copyrighted works. Each student gets a computer when they enter the academy. Illegal possession of copyrighted material could carry punishment including court-martial or a loss of leave, according to academy policy. The seizure comes just a few weeks after movie and music industry trade groups sent a letter to more than 2,000 university and college presidents across the country, including officials at the Naval Academy, requesting help in cracking down on unauthorized file swapping. Software first aid RealNetworks is working on a new patch to address flaws in its popular media player software after the developer who discovered the problems said the original fix doesn't work. The vulnerabilities, which appear in the streaming media company's RealOne Player and Real Player, could affect as many as 115 million users of the software worldwide. RealNetworks posted a patch last week, but an engineer said he was able to easily work around the fixes by making relatively minor changes to his attacks on the software. The three flaws could result in what's known as a "buffer overflow," a memory problem that could compromise security controls and theoretically allow an attacker to take control of a PC running the Real media player. Sun Microsystems' Solaris operating system also took a security hit. A flaw in the software that handles fonts for the desktop interface on Solaris-based workstations and servers could leave the computers open to attack. The vulnerability could give hackers and online vandals the ability to take control of Solaris-based systems. A Sun spokesman confirmed that the company knew of the flaw and said the company was working on a patch. The flaw, another buffer overflow problem, appears in the X Windows Font Server (XFS) software known as fs.auto, a key component of the Solaris desktop system. Holiday sales rebound? Computer manufacturers are launching aggressive promotions intended to jump-start holiday sales, but these may not be enough to salvage a mediocre year. The race to offer consumers the fastest and cheapest PCs includes instant discounts at the checkout counter, mail-in rebates in excess of $100, and enhanced bundles. For example, Dell Computer is selling its new Dimension 2350 desktop with a 15-inch flat-panel display for $699 after a $100 rebate. Dell and Hewlett-Packard have also taken the plunge, dropping the price for upgrading from a CD burner to a DVD burner on a desktop to about $200. Notebooks with bundled DVD burners could also prove popular. Several other promotions are likely to reappear after Thanksgiving, such as processor-based rebates and gift cards for consumers who buy a new PC. Digital camera manufacturers will get in on the act next month, when prices for midrange digital cameras are expected to fall below $100. Prices for digital cameras have been steadily declining as the market grows, but with camera makers competing to pump up holiday sales, more drastic cuts could be in store. Cameras with resolution of 2 megapixels--usually considered the minimum for good snapshot-size prints--could be selling for as low as $99 in a few weeks. Current prices for such cameras bottom out at around $199. However, camera makers would likely be losing money at such prices.

2003-07-11 - Week in review Privacy in peril    Wal-Mart Stores shoppers can breathe easier knowing that an experimental wireless inventory control system won't be tracking them and their purchases from the store to their homes. Wal-Mart unexpectedly canceled testing for the system, ending one of the first and most closely watched efforts to bring controversial radio frequency identification technology to store shelves in the United States. A Wal-Mart representative said the retail giant would not conduct a planned trial of a so-called smart-shelf system with partner Gillette that was scheduled to begin last month at an outlet in a Boston suburb. Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology uses microchips to wirelessly transmit product serial numbers to a scanner without the need for human intervention. The technology is seen as an eventual successor to bar-code inventory tracking systems, promising to cut distribution costs for manufacturers and improve retailing margins. Backers of the technology foresee billions of packaged goods tracked using in-store RFID systems that might one day help prevent shoplifting and speed shoppers through automated checkout lines. But the technology has drawn attacks from consumer privacy groups that worry about potential abuses if product-tracking tags are allowed to follow people from stores into their homes. The news isn't so good for file swappers. Those hoping to share music and other works online without exposing their identity to the prying eyes of copyright enforcers face a tough choice. Hiding on a file-sharing system is hard for a very simple reason: Peer-to-peer networks are designed for efficiency, not anonymity. They rely on a straightforward mechanism that is ruthlessly efficient at trading files. But, by broadcasting the contents of shared folders, the system leaves people vulnerable to identification and, therefore, to possible legal action. On a peer-to-peer network, files are directly swapped between computers, each of which has a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address that can be traced back to the Internet service provider, corporation or university to which it belongs. Because computers on a peer-to-peer network transfer files without going through an intermediary, the IP address of one person on the network is generally available to everyone else. Runaround suin' The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sued the parent company of Puretunes, a Spanish site that briefly offered inexpensive music downloads. Puretunes emerged in May, claiming that it had won rights from several Spanish licensing agencies that gave it the ability to distribute major-label music legally online. Label representatives said the site was operating illegally because Puretunes had not acquired the permission of labels, artists or song publishers. However, the service went offline last month. The RIAA suit comes after several weeks of complaints from angry Puretunes customers. Puretunes' plan was to give visitors all-you-can-download access to a vast music library for time periods such as one night, one weekend or one week. On the other side of the copyright fight, a group representing small Webcasters is threatening to sue the RIAA on antitrust grounds, fearful that hundreds or thousands of stations will be pushed offline. The Webcaster Alliance, a group representing about 300 Net radio stations, says royalty agreements negotiated last year at the behest of Congress and the Library of Congress threaten to put a number of small stations out of business. The group's members have not paid royalties to copyright owners under any of several possible payment schemes, one of which was passed last year by Congress in an attempt to protect the economic viability of small Net radio stations. In another corner of the copyright battle, a federal appeals court ruled that search engines' display of miniature images is fair use under copyright law, but the legality of presenting full-size renditions of visual works has yet to be determined. The court ruled that use of thumbnail images in search engines is legal, confirming an earlier ruling by the same court from February 2002. But the court withdrew a previous decision on the display of full-size images, which it had deemed beyond the bounds of fair use because it was likely to harm the market for a photographer's work. Chip push Intel laid the groundwork for an all-out push later this year, with details leaking about its upcoming desktop, server and mobile processors. Prescott, the next big desktop chip from Intel, is slated to come out at 3.4GHz, while Dothan, an energy-efficient chip for slim notebooks, will have a server-size cache and is expected to debut at 1.8GHz, according to computer industry sources. Prescott, which will come out in the fourth quarter, will contain a number of enhancements over the current Pentium 4, including new instructions for multimedia processing and a 1MB cache, a pool of memory on the chip for fast data access. Current Pentium 4s have a 512KB cache. The chip is slated to come out at 3.4GHz, according to the sources, and then speed up to 3.6GHz in the first quarter of 2004. Intel is also working on an energy-efficient Itanium 2 chip for blade servers and workstations called Deerfield. The chip is scheduled to debut in the third quarter at $744, according to Intel product plans seen by CNET News.com. That's substantially below the price of Intel's other Itanium 2 chips, which range from $1,338 to $4,226. The Deerfield pricing seems deliberately calculated to attack one of the chronic problems associated with the Itanium line: slow sales. Since it came out in May 2001, the Itanium family has barely made a dent in the server market in terms of unit shipments. However, Intel has steadily increased performance and has funded application development, which could begin to change the picture.

2005-10-14 - Week in review Microsoft makes nice    Microsoft has buried the hatchet with RealNetworks and formed an alliance with Yahoo, but such moves are unlikely to cool the regulatory heat under the software giant. Microsoft and RealNetworks announced a sweeping deal on Tuesday that puts aside their legal differences and aims to shore up their respective digital-music strategies. Under the deal, Microsoft will pay $460 million in cash to RealNetworks to settle antitrust claims. It will also pay $301 million in cash to support Real's music and game efforts, and Microsoft will promote Real's Rhapsody subscription music service on its MSN Web business. RealNetworks had alleged in its December 2003 lawsuit that Microsoft had abused its "monopoly power to restrict how PC makers install competing media players while forcing every Windows user to take Microsoft's media player, whether they want it or not." Real originally sought $1 billion in damages. As part of the deal, Real will also end its direct involvement in antitrust investigations across the globe, including probes in Europe and Korea. MS continues to staunch legal wrangles by infusing cash into the former competitors. Sounds like the Michael Jackson approach to me. --Earl Bensar RealNetworks was the largest corporation participating in the European Union's antitrust prosecution and must withdraw from those proceedings under the terms of the settlement. But that likely won't make things easier for Microsoft during its appeal. "The settlement strengthens the Commission's case," said Thomas Vinje, an antitrust attorney with Clifford Chance in Brussels, Belgium. "Real has already provided evidence for the case, and that record is complete and in Luxembourg." Some CNET News.com readers scorned the deal. "MS continues to staunch legal wrangles by infusing cash into the former competitors," writes Earl Bensar in News.com's TalkBack forum. "Sounds like the Michael Jackson approach to me." Perhaps ironically, Apple Computer may have given RealNetworks an incentive to strike a deal with Microsoft. In early 2004, RealNetworks Chief Executive Rob Glaser made several appeals to Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs, asking him to make the popular iPod compatible with other companies' music services. Jobs later told Apple shareholders that working with RealNetworks was simply "not worth it." Three months later, the shunned RealNetworks announced that it had successfully reproduced Apple's iPod technology with its new "Harmony" music tool. Glaser said the development of Harmony, which also provided compatibility with Microsoft software, helped improve the relationship between RealNetworks and the software company. Whatever its impact on RealNetworks and Microsoft, the deal is unlikely to change the dynamics in the broader digital music market anytime soon, analysts said. Apple's iTunes music store and its iPod music player each retain more than 80 percent of their respective markets. That dominance has been locked in place by consumers' ongoing love affair with the iPod, and rival MP3 manufacturers' inability to create a similarly popular product. At least one top record company executive said the deal could help push Apple toward offering its own subscription service, a business model that Jobs has criticized in the past. But the same label executive, who asked not to be named, said Microsoft and its hardware allies still need to make better, simpler, more widely compatible MP3 players if they are to encroach on Apple's share. Microsoft also buddied up to Yahoo, announcing plans to make their instant-messaging services interoperable. Analysts called the move a shot at market leader America Online's AOL Instant Messenger and a defensive jab at newcomer Google. Beginning in the second quarter of 2006, customers of Yahoo Messenger or MSN Messenger programs will be able to exchange instant messages, see the presence of their contacts, share emoticons, add friends from either service and make PC-to-PC voice calls. Multiprotocol IM clients like Trillian and Fire seem seamless enough for many users, enabling them to use several instant-message programs under one interface. But Yahoo and MSN have tried to wall out third-party integrators, calling their moves preemptive measures against IM spam, or spim. But the partnership has a flipside, an instant-messaging security expert said. "As Microsoft, Yahoo and others connect their global IM networks, IM worms will spread faster and attack a larger population of end-users," said Jon Sakoda, chief technology officer at messaging security company IMlogic. Watching TV without your TV No time for "Lost" last night? Just download it and watch it during your commute. That's what Apple Computer hopes you will do with the unveiling of its long-rumored video iPod and an updated version of iTunes that lets users buy music videos, TV shows and movies. The music players, which come in black or white with a 2.5-inch screen, will be available in a 30GB model for $299 and a 60GB version for $399. The new devices hold up to 15,000 songs, 25,000 photos or more than 150 hours of video. With the new version of iTunes, unveiled five weeks after the debut of iTunes 5, consumers can buy non-burnable music videos for $1.99. In addition to music videos, consumers will be able to purchase TV shows one day after their initial broadcast. It will take 10 to 20 minutes to download an episode. Each will cost $1.99 and will be ad-free. Apple kicked also announced a new iMac G5 desktop computer that will be similar to the current model but thinner. The 17-inch 1.9GHz goes for $1,299; the 20-inch 2.1GHz model is $1,699. The iMacs will come with a built-in, Webcam-style iSight camera with still and video capabilities, and a new Apple remote that lets consumers control music, photos and video from 30 feet away. The release of Apple's new iTunes store for videos provides a look at a business model likely to unsettle the movie, television, advertising and retail markets for years to come. With this first step into the video sales market, Apple is taking a path similar to the one followed by its initial iTunes music store, which started with a relatively number of titles that were accessible only to the relatively small number of Macintosh computer users out there. But it was an effective way to persuade a formerly reluctant music industry to allow broader online distribution. Apple's deal with Disney appears to include a similar foot-in-the-door strategy, starting with a small amount of content to which it will add much more in the near future. It does go beyond anything else online, however, offering consumers the ability to download a purchased version of several shows the day after they air, along with back episodes. EchoStar Communications is also getting into the portable video player market. PocketDish can download, record and play content from a PC or Mac, digital cameras, mass-storage devices, as well as from sources such as digital video players, camcorders and video cassette recorders, the company said. It is compatible with most television sets and consumer electronic devices currently available. In addition, customers of EchoStar's Dish Network can dock PocketDish to select DVRs, using a USB 2.0 connection for fast video transfers. An hour of Dish programming can be transferred to the portable device in about five minutes, the company said. Intel's chip secrets CNET News.com got a look at Intel's confidential road map, which shows plans for a dizzying array of single- and dual-core chips for 2006. Performance-enhancing features such as hyperthreading, 64-bit functionality, execute/disable and virtualization will appear together, separately, in varying combinations or not at all, depending on the chip and the type of computer in which it will be used. Of course, chips will vary by speed, cache size and bus speed. The chipmaker's first round of Viiv entertainment-branded PCs will be included on Intel motherboards code-named Bad Axe, Palm Canyon and Bear Canyon. Each motherboard will include LGA775 packaging for 3.60GHz and higher processor frequencies. These computers will rely on the upcoming Yonah notebook chip. Yonah, a new notebook chip coming from Intel early next year, will run slightly faster than expected, but may also consume more power than its contemporaries. Intel road maps indicate the next-generation Pentium M will debut at speeds up to 2.16 GHz and possibly 2.33 GHz--slightly faster than the 2GHz or less anticipated by sources in August. Yonah will also come with a 667-MHz bus, which is a channel for ferrying data between the processor and memory; today's Pentium Ms feature a 533-MHz bus. Yonah chips, though, will carry higher maximum-power-consumption ratings than current Pentium Ms. Most likely, that's because most Yonahs will sport two processing cores, rather than the single core found in today's notebook chips. Intel is expected to begin the introduction of its "Montecito" processors with three models running at 1.6GHz and 1.4GHz, but by the end of the first half of next year, at least six more are scheduled to arrive. The plan also shows an even broader portfolio of Xeons, a vastly more popular server chip that, unlike Itanium, can run the same software as other x86 chips such as Pentiums. The road map also shows that Itanium clock speeds will get a 200MHz boost from the addition of Intel's new "Foxton" technology, which lets chips run faster as long as they don't get too hot. Violence, viruses and video games If life can imitate art, can life imitate video games? Some scientists will tell you yes. Violent video games appear to put the human brain in a mood to fight, according to a new study from Michigan State University. In the study, 13 males played the first-person shooter game "Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror" while in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) system, which measures brain activity. The brain scans of 11 of the subjects exhibited "large observed effects" characteristic of aggressive thoughts. The researchers said the pattern of brain activity can be considered to be caused by virtual violence. "There is a causal link between playing the first-person shooting game in our experiment and brain-activity pattern that are considered as characteristic for aggressive cognitions and effects," said Rene Weber, assistant professor of communication and telecommunication at MSU. "There is a neurological link, and there is a short-term causal relationship." However, online video games may also hold clues to deadly viruses. A plague that hit the virtual game "World of Warcraft" in late September quickly propagated, causing the temporary death of innumerable players and significant damage to large numbers of others. But to some scientists and educators, virtual reality outbreaks could prove a valuable tool for studying the spread of infectious diseases and the public response to them. The correlation between online and real-world behavior in the face of epidemics, they say, takes on heightened significance in the face of public-health threats like a potential avian flu pandemic. Virtual online worlds--where players' economic and social behavior is often a microcosm of their off-line behavior--are a perfect place to compare real-world infectious diseases with those comprised only of digital ones and zeros. Among other things, she explained, virtual environments can allow researchers to see how social ostracization occurs as a disease spreads and people try to avoid going near the infected. Speaking of realism in video games, CNET News.com's Daniel Terdiman joined a small crowd of journalists invited to try their hands at 12 titles expected to be ready in time for the Xbox 360 launch next month. He calls Microsoft's next-generation video game console an "impressive machine." The invitees were immediately immersed in a magical world of stunning graphics that brought even the blades of grass to life. The level of detail was monumental. "The attention to detail on "Project Gotham Racing 3" was indeed noteworthy: spectators who reacted individually when my car got too close, glare on the window, even a realistic reflection in the side-view mirror," he writes in his reporter's notebook. "And the driving, I have to admit, was pure fun."

2003-04-25 - Week in review Chip beef   The technology world experienced its own version of sweeps week, with chip giants Intel and Advanced Micro Devices and software titan Microsoft vying for big businesses' attention and dollars. AMD kicked off the product parade by releasing its long-awaited Opteron processor. First revealed in 1999, the server chip represents the company's best opportunity ever to sell chips to corporate customers and into the lucrative server market. Opteron can run 32-bit Windows-Linux software, which is found on desktops and small servers around the world, and 64-bit software, which is used on high-end servers. The 64-bit software that will run on the chip will be almost identical to the kinds of applications and operating systems corporate customers use now, making it easy and cheap to adopt. Opteron was welcomed with a major vote of confidence from IBM. Big Blue said it would use the AMD server chip in future server hardware, including a server system and high-performance computing clusters. Server maker RackSaver chipped in with three servers, including the four-processor Quatrex-64. Sun Microsystems' software products will support the new processor--but not initially the chip's 64-bit capabilities that distinguish it from rival Intel processors. In the open-source arena, SuSE released a version of Linux that's tuned for Opteron, with rival Red Hat planning its own product for the fall. Meanwhile, rival chipmaker Intel isn't content to let AMD get a leg up. Intel is working on software designed to dramatically improve how well its Itanium chips run programs written for its Pentium or Xeon processors, CNET News.com has learned. The software could make Itanium processors more appealing to customers that have been reluctant to use Itanium systems because of the difficulty of running older 32-bit software. In addition, Intel's new strategy could undermine one Opteron's key advantages because it allows customers to gradually transition to new applications without having to discard their current applications. Itanium got a large vote of confidence from petrochemical giant British Petroleum, which purchased a large cluster of Hewlett-Packard Linux servers using Intel's Itanium 2 processors to help search for oil and gas deposits. BP bought 259 HP rx5670 systems, each with four Itanium 2 processors. The systems collectively have more than 8,000GB of memory and can perform 4 trillion calculations per second. Opening Windows Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer launched Windows Server 2003, a new version of the company's server operating system, which he described as "the right product" to help companies stretch their IT budgets. The company is positioning the new operating system as capable of pushing aside Unix servers and mainframes in the enterprise--its long-term goal since the first release of a version of Windows for server systems nearly a decade ago. Ballmer said that Windows Server 2003 would "improve efficiency by 30 percent from where we've been, and (would deliver) even larger numbers" compared with other operating systems. That 30 percent cost reduction would come through server consolidation, improved management features and tighter security features. But analysts didn't share Ballmer's enthusiasm. Many companies are very reluctant to commit money to upgrade servers that may be working just fine as is. Potential buyers also will need to navigate a product lineup that is more complex than with previous versions, with prices largely unchanged from previous versions. Unisys was one of a few manufacturers using the release of the operating system to launch new servers. Most other manufacturers are announcing the availability of the software on existing machines. Dell Computer and HP also will tout new customers and services offers aimed specially at enterprise customers, while IBM plans to stick with its broad range of existing services. On the desktop side, Microsoft is preparing a new test version of its upcoming Office 2003, which will delay the final release of the product until later this year. A company representative said the release is intended to give customers a chance to try out changes made to the software as a result of testing. Delivery of the new test version would not give Microsoft enough time to adequately test the software in time for its planned summer delivery. Now, Microsoft says Office 2003 will ship "later in the summer," which is also subject to change. Cracking Windows Microsoft was busy on the security front as well. The software giant released an update for Windows NT that fixes the critical vulnerability that allowed an intruder to sneak onto a military server running Windows 2000. The software giant issued the patch after learning of the problem, but decided to do its standard analysis to check whether the rest of its operating systems were vulnerable. The flaw could allow an attacker to gain total control of an Internet-accessible computer running unpatched versions of the Windows 2000 and NT operating systems, according to the revised advisory posted to Microsoft's site. Microsoft warned customers that they should apply updates for both Internet Explorer and Outlook Express to fix critical security vulnerabilities that could let attackers run programs on a victim's PC. Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5 and 6.0 all have four flaws, the worst of which could allow an attacker to take control of a person's computer if a victim were to follow links to a Web site or read an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) e-mail created by an attacker. The flaw in Outlook Express is in the way that the application handles the encapsulation of HTML in e-mail. A software error in the component allows an attacker to run programs on a victim's computer. Net music discord After releasing the first single from her new "American Life" album online a few weeks ago, Madonna's Web site was hacked last weekend, with links to pirated versions of her full album replacing the site?s content. The hacker's attack appeared to be in response to Madonna's most recent, typically colorful broadside against file-swappers who sought free copies of her music. The singer has put files that appear to be versions of her new songs onto peer-to-peer networks that actually contain recordings of her saying, "What the f*** do you think you're doing?" The hacked page, as sent to CNET News.com by several readers, had a message that read, "This is what the f*** I think I'm doing." It also contained what appeared to be links to the album's songs. Two major record labels sued Napster investor Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, alleging that it contributed to rampant music theft through the former file-swapping network. Universal Music Group and EMI Recorded Music filed a lawsuit against San Francisco-based Hummer Winblad, its co-founder John Hummer and general partner Hank Barry, who was formerly the CEO at Napster. The 23-page complaint charges that the Napster system, as conceived and implemented, "provided a safe haven for the rampant piracy of copyrighted works on an epic and unprecedented scale...Hummer Winblad knowingly facilitated infringement of plaintiff's copyrights for its direct financial benefit." Verizon Communications must give up the identity of an anonymous Internet subscriber accused of swapping music files online, a U.S district court has ruled for a second time. The case has been closely watched by entertainment industry figures and privacy advocates as a key test for how easily file-swappers can be found and identified by copyright holders. An earlier court decision that also said Verizon would have to give up the information had been temporarily put on hold. The decision will force the telephone company to give up its subscriber's name in 14 days, unless an appeals court steps in to block the decision pending further review.

2023-09-12 - Want to Buy the New Pink iPhone 15 in Stores Today It Depends on Which Phone You Choose    TheiPhone 15is available in stores as of today. Whether you want the baselineiPhone 15 or the iPhone 15 Plus, or if you're looking to buy the premium iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max, you should know that the colors you can choose from aren't the same across the board.Still trying to figure out which model is right for you? CNET's got you covered. Our reviews of the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus go through all the new features, including the new dynamic island, USB-C charging and improved camera quality. CNET mobile expert Patrick Holland has tried out the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, and his review explains why he believes they're "one of Apple's most compelling releases in years."Once you know which model is the best fit for you, here's what colors they are available in. The new rainbow of iPhone 15 colors have a distinct pastel palette. Apple/Gif by Arielle Burton/CNETThe new iPhone 15 and 15 Plus will be available in pink, yellow, green, blue and black.The new iPhone 15 Pro will also be available in four textured titanium options: black, white, blue and natural. The Pro Max is getting the four-color titanium treatment as well. The new iPhone 15 Pro titanium colors, from left to right: Black, white, blue and natural. Apple/Screenshot by James Martin/CNETApple announced the new models at its Sept. 12 "Wonderlust" event. Apple said the new iPhone 15 is the first smartphone ever to have its colors "embedded throughout a single piece of durable color-infused glass." The company's use of metallic ions allows it to control the saturation of the color in the glass back, creating this new roster of colors, Apple said. The iPhone 15 models have a matte finish, with the titanium 15 Pro and Pro Max models coming with a textured matte finish. Watch this: Everything Apple Announced at Its iPhone 15 Event 11:36 Apple's new pink love affair: The pink iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Apple/Screenshot by CNETIf you were getting Barbie vibes throughout Apple's Wonderlust event, you weren't alone.Apple's two focus areas for the event this week were iPhones and Apple Watches, and for both of those segments of its presentation, pink was everywhere. In the first moments of the iPhone 15's introduction to the world, the video started off in a pink haze. We swirl through this pink metallic world, until the pink iPhone 15 is revealed, domino-ing into the other colors afterward. The new Apple Watch Series 9 comes with a new, easy-to-use double tap feature. Apple/Gif by Arielle Burton/CNETDuring the Apple Watch segments, pink was front and center -- literally. The new Apple Watch Series 9 shows off its new pink model, and we see the new models flying in followed by an electric trail of pink rays.So, this all raises the question: What is Apple's motivation behind this new pink love affair? For anyone who's been online -- or near a movie theater -- this summer, the cultural phenomenon that isthe Barbie movieseems like an obvious answer. As Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie havedominated the box office, the cultural hype surrounding the movie has taken on Mattel's iconic pink tone. From the movie's extensive marketing campaign to fans' "Barbie-core" reaction, pink has skyrocketed in popularity.The new Apple products aren't the exact shade of Barbie pink we've become accustomed to the past few months, and we don't know for sure that Barbie inspired the new color. But now's a great time to release a new pink iPhone.Titanium tones: iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max colorsTitanium also dominated Apple's new product announcements. Rumors circulated in the days before the event that the darker hues of the Wonderlust logo would be seen in the new colors of the iPhone. We now know that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models are the ones that'll be available in these textured, darker colors.Similar to the basic names of the iPhone 15 colors, the names of the titanium shade range are simple: black titanium, white titanium, blue titanium and natural titanium. Watch this: iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max: First Look 03:58 These models are a stark contrast from the light, springtime feel of the iPhone 15s. The Pro and Pro Max colors are dark, with metallic flecks that are subtle but still eye-catching. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are the Oppenheimer to the iPhone 15's Barbie.The Pro model colors are more in line with what Apple has historically created for its phone. When the iPhone 14 launched last September, it was available in blue, purple, midnight, starlight and Product Red. Apple then surprised users in March the next year by announcing that the 14 and 14 Plus would also be available in a new color, a pastel yellow. Apple could have similar plans for the new iPhone 15 -- perhaps another springtime new addition? We'll have to wait and see.More from the Apple event iPhone 15, Apple Watch 9 and Everything Apple AnnouncediPhone 15 Pro Hands-On: Titanium Frame, 5x Zoom CameraApple Watch Series 9 First Look: Double Tap, Faster Performance
2003-09-17 - Veritas Intel team on server provisioning  In the latest step toward utility computing, Veritas Software and Intel are joining forces to help companies better manage servers. The companies on Wednesday announced plans to bundle Veritas' OpForce software with new Intel Enterprise Blade Server Family and Itanium processor-based server hardware building blocks. The software, which will ship under the moniker "Intel Deployment Manager by Veritas OpForce," aims to help companies set up servers more easily. Customers using a variety of Intel Enterprise Blade Server and Itanium processor-based server hardware can use the "provisioning" software to automate the configuration and implementation of multiple servers at once, instead of requiring a system administrator to configure servers manually and individually, the companies said. Blade servers are typically thin systems that slide into a larger chassis that provides shared resources such as power supplies and external network connections. "Easy-to-use software that works across Intel-based hardware building blocks is key to the success of modular computing," Abhijit Talwalkar, general manager of the Platform Products Group at Intel, said in a statement. Intel first plans to bundle the OpForce software with its Enterprise Blade Server Family products and eventually include OpForce with Itanium processor-based server products, said Pat Buddendaum, a product manager at Intel. Server provisioning is part of a broader industrywide effort to make computing more like a utility, where customers don't have to worry about the technology underlying the service they receive. The announcement also shows Intel expanding into new turf. Historically, Intel has left it up to its customers, such as Hewlett-Packard, to ship software. Other companies with software to provision servers include Sun Microsystems, HP and IBM. The OpForce software product stems from Veritas' acquisition of Jareva Technologies earlier this year. Veritas has been moving beyond its roots as a storage software company and into the utility computing arena. Although its known for its microprocessors, Intel makes motherboards and servers that are ready for another company to put its label on and sell. The chipmaking giant is building blades and complete blade server systems for smaller manufacturers, such as China's Lenovo and Russia's Kraftway, to spur adoption of blades. As part of this push, Intel on Wednesday released a complete blade containing two Xeon processors and said that a blade containing four Xeons, code-named McCarran, will appear in the fourth quarter. The products are members of what Intel is calling the Enterprise Blade Server Family. By the end of the year, more than 15 computer makers will resell the Intel parts. Intel has manufactured servers for the past few years. Many of the Itanium servers on the market were designed and manufactured by Intel and then sold under the brand name of a computer manufacturer. Intel doesn't insert the memory or hard drive in its servers, but these are relatively simple tasks. The new blades, though, are more ornate that Intel's earlier servers. They will be loaded with networking capabilities and the management software from Veritas. "The provisioning software that we are making available is another step in the integration," Buddendaum said. CNET News.com's Michael Kanellos contributed to this report.
2000-05-18 - VA Linux wants to challenge Sun for high-end systems   VA Linux Systems has introduced a new low-end server, but it has its sights set much higher. The company today will introduce model 2130, a single-processor, 3.5-inch thick rack-mounted machine with starting prices less than $1,400, said Brian Biles, vice president of marketing at VA. In the longer term, VA has ambitions to steal market share for more expensive systems away from Sun Microsystems. "I don't think (Sun) can sell effectively anymore" to companies setting up large numbers of computers for high-traffic Web sites, said Biles, who in his last job plugged Sun network software. "They're turning into a mainframe company." Sun indeed said in April that it's feeling the effects of Linux competitors in its low-end computer business. However, with $4 billion in revenue for the last quarter and a dominant position in the Unix server business, Sun can afford to be complacent. VA had revenues of $20 million in its most recent quarter. Linux currently is limited mostly to low-end servers with one or two processors and computing jobs much less strenuous than what Unix servers with dozens of processors can handle. However, the new 2.4 version of the Linux kernel shows dramatic improvement, Linux founder Linus Torvalds has said. And Linux is spreading fast. In February, International Data Corp. reported that Linux had grown to seize a quarter of the market for server operating systems in 1999--something the market analysis firm didn't expect to happen until 2002 at the earliest. Biles pointed to two factors keeping Linux from pushing into more expensive systems. One is the lack of a "journaling file system," which lets Unix systems recover from a crash much faster. The other is the lack of a comparatively inexpensive 64-bit chip. Though Linux runs on 64-bit chips from Mips, Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard and Sun, cheaper 32-bit Intel chips are the Linux stronghold. VA and Intel both believe the upcoming 64-bit Itanium chip will push Linux to greater heights. The rise of the Internet is the major reason behind the success of Linux, a clone of Unix. Linux is developed cooperatively by programmers across the Internet who often have never met, and its low cost means it's popular for delivering Web pages to browsers. Typical configurations of VA's new server will cost about $1,500 to $1,700, Biles said. "The likely application for this one is probably going to be Web serving," he said. The machine joins three more expensive rack-mounted machines from VA: the two-processor, 3.5-inch thick 2200; the two-processor, 1.75-inch thick 1000; and the four-processor, 12.25-inch thick 3500. All the systems come with a version of Linux from SuSE, Debian or Red Hat, though Red Hat is the default version. Dell, one of VA's biggest competitors, also is interested in Linux servers. It offers a choice of Linux or Windows 2000 on its DellHost site, a bank of computers where people rent space to put up Web pages. Of the 2,000 customers who have signed on so far, half have requested Linux, said Tim Mattox, general manager of Dell's hosting group. It's the default option, and it costs $50 less per month than renting a Windows 2000 computer, he said.
2000-08-24 - VA Linux shares jump on strong earnings report Shares in VA Linux Systems climbed by more than 18 percent today, fueled by a report of stronger-than-expected revenue. Late yesterday, the company surpassed analyst expectations by reporting revenue of $50.7 million and a loss of 10 cents a share, a nickel better than analysts predicted. Shares were up $6.88 to $44 at the close of regular trading. Analysts generally expected revenue between $42.7 million and $44.5 million, and those surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected a loss of 15 cents a share. In the same quarter a year ago, VA had a net loss of 34 cents a share on revenue of $7.8 million. VA's net loss was $4.1 million, compared with $7.8 million the year before, the company said. The 10-cent loss excludes several items, including "write-off of in-process research and development, amortization of goodwill and intangible assets, amortization of compensation expense related to acquisitions, amortization of deferred stock compensation, and the dividend related to convertible preferred stock," VA said. ABN Amro analyst Keith Bachman and Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Amit Chopra both predicted next quarter's revenue will be about $65 million. "We see VA Linux continuing to exploit Linux's entry into new markets such as midrange servers and storage," Chopra said. The company's sales came chiefly from sales of rack-mountable servers used to build up Internet infrastructure, chief executive Larry Augustin said in an interview today. The most popular product is 3.5 inches thick, but future demand is moving to models 1.75 inches thick, he said. In addition, the company expects sales of servers packed with hard disks to be popular. Augustin predicted revenue next fiscal year to be 2.5 to 2.75 times this year's $120 million--$300 million to $330 million--but that still likely won't be enough to carry the company to profitability. "We're expecting to be in the black by the end of calendar 2001," the second quarter of VA's fiscal year, Augustin said. WR Hambrecht analyst Prakesh Patel sees VA's profit margins increasing. Several acquisitions by VA "show the solid progress VA has made" in shifting its revenue stream to high-margin professional services, hardware and software integrated to work together. The company's products sell to Internet service providers, customers needing data storage and Internet infrastructure, and all high-growth markets. VA's results mean Linux companies have surpassed analyst expectations twice in two days. Linux seller Caldera Systems yesterday reported a loss of 19 cents a share when analysts expected a loss of 25 cents. Caldera, though, had revenues of $1.2 million, much less than VA's. Though VA's growth has been swift, it still faces formidable competition. Dell Computer, IBM and others have aggressive plans to sell Linux servers, but those companies have deep relationships with customers, resellers and suppliers. And Sun Microsystems' $5 billion in revenue last quarter is 100 times that of VA. VA has some features its bigger siblings lack. The company touts its Linux experience, of course, but it also has a new build-to-order software system that lets customers choose in great detail what Linux software they want installed and save configurations for future purchases. VA expects these features to help build repeat business. The company also competes with other Linux companies, such as Red Hat, Caldera, SuSE, TurboLinux, Atipa, Penguin Computing, SteelEye and Mission Critical Linux. VA doesn't see any need to stray from designs based on Intel CPUs, Augustin said. Intel is an investor in VA. VA will be able to expand into new markets with the arrival of Intel's first 64-bit chip, Itanium, and its successor, code-named McKinley, Augustin said. "Clearly the driving application is big databases," which require 64-bit chips' ability to contain large amounts of memory, Augustin said. VA plans eight-processor servers for Itanium machines, he said. Currently, Linux isn't able to take good advantage of all those CPUs, but a new version is due soon. About 8 percent of VA's revenue in the last quarter came from services and from corporate sponsorship of its Open Source Developer Network, Augustin said. In the long run, VA expects about 15 percent of its revenue to be from services and 10 percent from its OSDN. OSDN, unveiled last week, collects news and other information from a number of VA-owned content sites including Linux.com, Slashdot, Freshmeat and SourceForge. Compaq, EMC, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, IBM and Sun are "technology partners" of OSDN, VA said. Meanwhile, many early investors have been selling shares in the company. Computer maker SGI sold 800,000 shares for about $31.5 million total today and yesterday. Two weeks ago, the company sold 350,000 shares for $15 million. Hughes Aircraft's retirement fund sold about 35,000 shares today for nearly $2 million. And the William Hambrecht Trust sold about 55,000 yesterday for $2.3 million. "While there continues to be insider selling, the majority of these are small amounts of stock from venture capital distributions. There have been no large blocks sold by key, operations-involved employees," Patel said.
2000-01-12 - VA Linux profit outlook depends on hardware    For VA Linux Systems, the road to profitability is paved with better hardware. The company, flush with funds from its record-setting IPO, has launched an ambitious plan to become one of the leading providers of servers to the Internet, said CEO Larry Augustin in an interview with News.com. Intel's upcoming Itanium processor and improvements to the Linux OS will be the first steps in the company's expansion, and plans for Europe and Asia will follow. Profit, however, will still be some time off, at least two years, Augustin said. Analysts expect VA to become profitable in late 2001 or early 2002, he said. VA Linux manufactures computers with Intel chips and the Linux operating system, a clone of Unix that competes with Microsoft. Linux, with its original programming instructions open for all to work with, is developed by a small army of "open-source" programmers. VA Linux, whose record IPO last month raised $132 million, plans to use the money to expand into Europe and Asia and increase its effort to packages services along with its hardware, Augustin said. It seems to be increasingly painless for Linux companies to get funding, with some winning investments from venture capital or computing companies, and others pulling in tens of millions through IPOs. Caldera Systems, a seller of Linux software, broke new ground yesterday by announcing both a $30 million investment and plans to go public. But getting money wasn't the main reason for an IPO, Augustin said. "We felt it was very important to be a public company because of the legitimacy it brings to the company and to Linux," he said. "It's not so much the cash infusion." Augustin admits there's increasing competition for Linux computers, with newer companies such as Penguin Computing joining established giants such as IBM, Dell Computer, Compaq Computer and Hewlett-Packard. But VA Linux doesn't want to conquer the entire market, Augustin said, just the back-end part of things. "We will dominate the Internet infrastructure market," he said. VA Linux has ambitious plans to expand its product line from its current stronghold--low-end server systems that companies often buy in bulk--into higher-end servers. To make these machines worthwhile, VA Linux is awaiting better chips from Intel and better high-end features in Linux itself. The guts of Linux, the software known as the kernel, is about to be upgraded from version 2.2 to version 2.4. Linus Torvalds, founder of the Linux movement and leader of the kernel development effort, initially hoped to release 2.4 before Jan. 1, but said in December that the revised schedule was to release it in the first quarter of 2000. Some have suggested that the new kernel will be released on Feb. 17, the same day Microsoft plans to make Windows 2000 available to customers. The 2.4 kernel will enable two key features for VA Linux in servers: the ability to let Intel chips talk to larger amounts of memory and a "journaling" file system that will make it easier for Linux computers to recover from crashes. Currently, Linux on Intel chips can handle only 2 gigabytes of memory. But Intel's Xeon chips can handle up to 32GB, a capability Linux will be able to take advantage of with the 2.4 kernel. Handling that extra memory is important for VA Linux, whose customers want to be able to hold entire Web sites in memory for fast response to Web servers. VA Linux also is awaiting Intel's 64-bit Itanium chip, due in mid-2000, which will allow computers to talk to vastly larger amounts of memory. That feature will be key for use of Linux by corporations who have large databases they want to hold entirely in memory, something that's generally possible only with 64-bit chips from Compaq, Sun, HP, IBM or SGI. Eight-processor systems also hold appeal for VA Linux. Currently, with the 2GB memory limitations of Linux, four-processor systems are barely justifiable, and eight-way machines aren't. "You need to have enough memory per processor for it to make sense," he said. "It's sort of an imbalance." For more modest servers, VA Linux ultimately hopes to whittle its rack-mountable, two-processor, 3.5-inch-tall FullOn servers into a size half that tall, a move that would enable the servers to be stacked even more densely at companies that need oodles of servers to house Web pages or fire queries at back-end databases. VA Linux also plans to sell more Linux computers for desktop use in the future, though right now such products generally sell only to developers and other technically savvy users, Augustin said. However, VA doesn't intent to ever get into smaller devices such as set-top boxes. Though companies such as Red Hat, Linuxcare, Santa Cruz Operation and even IBM are gunning for the same Linux services as VA Linux, Augustin is confident it will be able to stave off competitors. VA Linux will focus its expertise on helping companies design and assemble collections of hardware and software heavily customized for the task at hand. "This is the space we will own and go after," Augustin declared. Apparently investors were convinced by the plan. VA Linux had no difficulty rounding up underwriters to help the company go public, and the company met a strong response while pitching its business to potential investors on the "road show" that precedes an IPO. "As we were out on the road show, we knew there was a lot of interest," he said. "The bankers came back (with) very strong investor interest." Indeed VA Linux raised its expected price range from $11 to $13 to $21 to $23, then eventually to $28 to $30. The shares eventually priced out at $30, raising the company $132 million instead of the initial $57 million that was expected. Augustin acknowledges a debt of gratitude owed to Red Hat, whose IPO four months earlier paved the way for other Linux companies to come. Red Hat taught investors about the nature of Linux and open-source software, and instructed VA Linux ways to improve a Linux IPO, Augustin said. For Augustin, that improvement meant reworking the directed shares program Red Hat used to include thousands of open-source programmers in their IPO, with mixed results. "We discovered that a lot of individual investors who didn't understand the process were filling out forms," Augustin said. VA Linux didn't have those difficulties.
2003-12-04 - Utility computing reaches HP PCs printers  Hewlett-Packard announced several new hardware and software products Thursday that expand the utility computing idea for servers and extend the technology to printers and PCs. In one change, HP Unix server customers now can set their machines to add or remove processors automatically to respond to changing demands, paying as they go for the power they use. In another, Unix customers using midrange models of HP's new Integrity line of Itanium-based servers will be able to use this pay-per-use method, beginning in January. News.context What's new: HP is expanding the utility computing concept to printers and PCs. Bottom line: HP has been working feverishly to add specific products and services to its utility computing idea, an admittedly confusing strategy. Not only is the company racing against the competing N1 effort from Sun Microsystems and IBM's e-business on demand initiative, but HP also faces the imperative of customers who want to reduce the costs of operating their complex computing gear. For more info: Track the players A bigger departure is the inclusion of PCs and printers in the utility computing idea. In the first quarter of 2004, HP plans to begin selling "blade" PCs that are installed in large quantities in a central rack and shared over a network. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company argues that the systems will be easier to manage and that companies won't have to buy a PC for each employee who works in shifts or otherwise can share the same hardware. Pay-per-use is coming to printers with metering technology from HP that monitors how "consumables" such as laser printer toner are used up. The technology is designed to ensure that customers won't run out of necessary consumables or have to pay for excess inventory, HP said. HP has been working feverishly to add specific products and services to its utility computing idea, an admittedly confusing strategy it calls Adaptive Enterprise, which is focused on building computing systems that can quickly respond to changing workloads. Not only is the company racing against the competing N1 effort from Sun Microsystems and IBM's e-business on-demand Get Up to Speed on... Utility computing Get the latest headlines andcompany-specific news in ourexpanded GUTS section. initiative, but HP also faces the imperative of customers who want to reduce the costs of operating their complex computing gear. HP grabbed an early lead in the utility computing domain with its expensive but useful Utility Data Center product, but IBM has since caught up, after acquiring Think Dynamics in May, said Forrester analyst Laura Koetzle. "IBM and HP are pretty much neck and neck now. Sun tends to lag behind," she said. One advantage IBM and HP have are services groups that spend time trying to untangle, simplify and automate customers' computing infrastructure, Koetzle said. "Nobody is going to say, 'Take all my gear away so I can have the exciting new functionality,'" Koetzle said. "The vendors with the services organizations have a better chance of getting in there on the ground to write the connective tissue software that's necessary to make...this kind of organic functionality possible." Much of Thursday's new technology from HP rests on a foundation of "virtualization"--a process that makes it easier to move or reconfigure software tasks by separating them from the hardware on which they run. For example, virtualization of data storage makes it easier to increase or decrease the capacity of a networked storage system without disrupting software using that system. "The idea behind virtualization is to move those resources where you need it, when you need it," said Nick van der Zweep, director of infrastructure solutions and virtualization at HP. Virtualization is a key component of HP's Adaptive Enterprise effort as well as efforts from Sun, IBM, Computer Associates International, Veritas and others. Other components include "provisioning," in which jobs are assigned to specific hardware, and "service level agreements," in which metering software ensures that enough computing resources are available to meet performance requirements. HP's software for monitoring service-level agreements is called Workload Manager. An upgrade to the software lets it automatically add or remove processing power as needed to meet those service levels for customers running Oracle's database software or BEA Systems' application server software, van der Zweep said. "With Oracle and BEA, you simply specify that you need a quarter-second response time," van der Zweep said, providing an example. "It will carve out one (central processing unit), or two, four or 10. It'll dynamically increase and decrease the size of that server." In addition, the software dovetails with the pay-per-use plan so that customers are billed accordingly, van der Zweep said. The Workload Manager software itself costs $1,000 to $2,000 per server processor to run, he said. Blade PCs Blade PC technology, pioneered by start-up ClearCube Technology, will go under the Consolidated Client Infrastructure at HP. It will cost $1,500 per system, including the blade, a "thin client" needed at each desk to tap into the back-end blade, training and support. The blades alone cost $799. HP said the Consolidated Client Infrastructure will save customers an average $1,200 per user per year and up to 50 percent over four years. News.commentary Cutting to the chase on blade servers Will blades really pay off for customers who don't need high-density racks of servers? Yes--eventually. Each blade PC runs a copy of Windows XP Professional, but each user's personal information is stored on networked storage, said Tad Bodeman, director of marketing for the Consolidated Client Infrastructure. With Blade PCs, data is better protected, Bodeman said. About 60 percent of corporate data resides on hard drives, but less than 4 percent of users back up their data. When a blade PC crashes, though, the user just logs in to a new one, which loads the personal information from the centralized storage system. Companies such as Volkswagen Credit, a division of Volkswagen of America, and United States Steel have been testing the system using HP's BL10e blade servers, but the blade PCs will use Transmeta's 1.1GHz Efficeon processor when they go on sale in the first quarter of 2004, HP said. One major reason to employ blades: Information technology managers prefer centralized systems they control. But blade PCs won't be trivial to employ, some believe. "The concept of client blades has technical and economic merits. But there are cultural hurdles to be cleared," Illuminata analyst David Freund said. "Employees have become used to the freedom they've enjoyed with their desktop PCs. 'Freedom to run amok' would be the IT manager's view, of course." Blade PCs help administrators keep PC software stable and thereby make it easier to troubleshoot problems, Bodeman said. "On day zero, they are all the same. On day one, they are all different," he said. "It takes a very sophisticated technician to sort through what the end user did to cause a problem." One customer won over by the technology is Volkswagen Credit in Libertyville, Ill., which has about 1,200 PCs for 1,000 employees. The company has been testing blade PCs for a small group but expects to have 200 employees using it by the end of June, and possibly more than 500 staffers using it by December, said Jack Klosterman of Volkswagen Credit's information technology group. The company is saving money, because it's easier to move employees without having to move PCs, it's cheaper to set up new systems, users don't have to wait as long if a system crashes, and the systems are easier to manage, Klosterman said. Blade PCs could be taken in several future utility computing directions as well. For example, unused PCs could be assigned other processing tasks through more sophisticated provisioning software. Or with use of VMware's virtualization software, a single machine could run several PCs. HP declined to comment on future plans. HP uses "allocation engine" technology from F5 networks to link the users to the blade PCs, Bodeman said.
2005-11-14 - US pads lead in global supercomputing ranking  Two and a half years ago, federal officials were alarmed about U.S. competitiveness in supercomputers, which can model global weather, molecular interaction or simulate nuclear explosions, among other things. But it appears their concerns might have been exaggerated. In the new Top500 list of supercomputers, 305 of the machines on the list are installed in the U.S., up from 277 six months ago. The number of machines installed in Europe, China and Japan, meanwhile, dipped. Thirty four of the top 35 come from U.S. manufacturers or universities while 479 of the computers have a North American pedigree. IBM remained the dominant company in supercomputers. Big Blue accounted for five out of the top 10 supercomputers in the semiannual Top500 ranking, including the top three computers on the list. Overall, Big Blue accounted for 43.8 percent of the machines on the list, more than any other manufacturer or university. The company's BlueGene/L, which knocked NEC's Earth Simulator from its top spot in November 2004, remained the top-ranked supercomputer in the world for the third time in a row. Installed in Lawrence Livermore National Labs, the computer has doubled in size in the past six months and now contains 131,076 processors. It will continue to grow. "The limit is less of an issue of architectural characteristics than....what the customers are looking for," said Dave Turek, vice president of Deep Computing at IBM. BlueGene/L can now churn 280.6 teraflops, or nearly 281 trillion calculations a second and is the only computer to exceed 100 teraflops. "This system is expected to remain the number one supercomputer in the world for the next few editions of the Top500 list," wrote the Top500 organization in an outline of the list. Other U.S.-based companies fared well too. Hewlett-Packard accounted for 33.8 percent of the computers, rebounding to 169 from a dip of 131 computers in June. Dell landed in the top 10 with the fifth-ranked "Thunderbird," an 8,000-processor supercomputer installed at Sandia National Laboratories. Intel microprocessors were found in 333, or two-thirds, of the machines on the list. The number of supercomputers sporting Intel Itanium chips dropped drastically. Growth, however, was seen in those carrying 64-bit Intel Xeons or Opteron processors from Advanced Micro Devices. The list, which will be released formally at the SC05 Supercomputing Conference in Seattle on Monday, ranks computers by how they perform on a benchmark, called Linpack. Linpack emphasizes how rapidly a computer performs a dense battery of floating point or decimal calculations. The test doesn't completely examine performance, but it does provide a functional gauge for ranking supercomputers. Still, officials want to come up with different ways to rank these machines. Companies and nations fiercely compete for rankings. For two and a half years, the now seventh-ranked Earth Simulator, which occupies a three-story building, sat atop the list. Worried about national competitiveness, U.S. federal officials began to push manufacturers to built even better custom machines. IBM and others, meanwhile, said that supercomputers needed to be made from components that could be standardized for commercial use. IBM largely won the debate. The technology behind BlueGene/L, while exotic now, will trickle down to commercial systems, Turek said. The computer was also designed to economize on space and energy. In all, BlueGene/L fits into 64 computer racks, which can fit into a standard-size computer room in a large corporation. It also consumes around 1.5 to 1.7 megawatts, Turek added. "That's still a lot of watts, but if you constructed a Linux cluster to provide (about) the same performance, you might be in the twenty megawatt range," Turek said. "Because we take a building block approach, the way we look at it is, if you build something for 64 racks, you ought to be able to sell someone a half rack." Although the federal government has been more supportive of supercomputing research in the past few years, BlueGene/L actually kicked off in December 1999. Initially, it was a research project, but as time went on, IBM began to design the machine with commercialization in mind. Turek recalled the mid-'90s, when he told designers on the project, "I don't know where the future is going to be, but how about we run Linux on this so we can run applications on it." Other facts and trends from the list: The list remains incredibly fluid. Four of the top 10 systems were displaced by completely new computers, while 221 computers from the list that came out in June are now too small to include on the list. The rapid turnover is partly the result of clustering servers to build a supercomputer. In the past, many supercomputers were designed as an organic whole. Clusters now account for 72 percent of the machines on the list, although the clusters become more prevalent as the list descends. In June, clusters accounted for just 61 percent. In terms of processors, what's popular in servers also works in supercomputers. Intel 32-bit x86 processors, the same architecture behind most Xeon servers and Pentium 4 desktops, powered 206 of the systems. The second most popular chip architecture was the 64-bit version of Intel x86 processors, found in 81 of the machines. The combined types of Power chips animate in 81 computers. Opteron is eating Itanium. Fifty five of the computers on the list sported an AMD Opteron chip, up from 25 in June. Intel's Itanium powered only 46 of the systems, down from 79 in the June ranking. Industry remains the big consumer of supercomputers. Commercial organizations own 266 on the list while 121 are in research labs and 70 toil in academia. Gigabit Ethernet is the most popular way to connect chips inside these beasts: 249 computers on the list use it. Myrinet is found in 101 of the systems. Apple Computer has one computer on the list: a 448-processor machine at Maryland's Bowie State University. It clocks in at No. 308. There are three others on the list, however, that are considered "self-made" by the organization that consist of Apple servers.

2002-04-08 - Unix servers breaking out all over The Unix server floodgates are opening this week, with Compaq Computer and SGI showing off new systems at the same time that powerhouses IBM and Sun Microsystems release new machines. Compaq has begun shipping test versions of a new line of AlphaServer Unix servers using the EV7 "Marvel" version of the company's Alpha processor, the Houston-based company said Monday. The system uses direct connections between processors, forgoing the usual high-speed switch that typically connects processors in high-end systems, Compaq said. Also moving ahead is SGI, which thus far hasn't been able to escape the graphics and technical-computing niche and break into the broader business market. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company announced a Unix machine tuned to broadcast markets and began showing its next-generation "Fuel" workstation. The system is based on the top-end 3000 family of Onyx workstations and Origin servers, which have high-speed connections linking processors, memory and video. But Compaq and SGI haven't achieved the market success of competing Unix servers from IBM, Sun and Hewlett-Packard. Those larger companies are moving aggressively as well, trying to eke sales out of a Unix market that shrank 18.7 percent from $25.3 billion in 2000 to $20.6 billion in 2001. As expected, IBM released on Monday its p670, a 16-processor machine that's essentially a smaller version of Big Blue's top-end 32-processor p690 "Regatta" server introduced in late 2001. The p670 has a starting price of $178,000 with four processors, $317,000 with eight, and $536,000 with 16, IBM said. The system can be divided into as many as 16 "partitions"--essentially mini-servers within the overall system--but IBM hasn't yet released software that will allow the sizes of those partitions to be changed without rebooting. Big Blue's newest machine will compete chiefly against the Unix servers from HP, long king of the midrange market, and from Sun, which will release its own midrange offering, the "Starkitty," on Tuesday. The Starkitty is a lesser version of Sun's 72-processor Sun Fire 15K "Starcat" system. HP, whose midrange 16-processor rp8400 also has advanced features culled from the company's top-end Superdome model, said Monday that it's the "preferred" provider of servers for some Oracle software used by HP customers to handle interactions with their own customers. In regard to Compaq's chip and server designs, the company decided to cancel the highly regarded Alpha chip and adopt Intel's Itanium family instead, a move that's not complicated too much by the HP-Compaq merger because HP plans a similar move later with its own PA-RISC chip. HP spawned the idea behind the Itanium family and is working gradually to move from its PA-RISC processors to the Itanium family. Compaq's EV7 will be the last major version of the Alpha. Compaq's design expertise is expected to live on, though, whether as part of HP or not. The company's designers have built features into the EV7 AlphaServers that can let the systems diagnose and repair some problems, correct data transfer problems automatically, and be easily expanded. The new EV7 systems are in testing at health care computing company Cerner, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and the French Atomic Commission's Military Applications Department. SGI also announced at the National Association of Broadcasters conference a new video-on-demand server, a machine that can send out 600 video streams simultaneously. The system is based on the Origin 300 server and has two or four processors, as much as 4GB of memory, and a TP900 storage system. It can be used to send video on networks using Ethernet, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB), SGI said. Sun, however, is making moves of its own in the market. It teamed up with Sony, which will build video-on-demand servers incorporating Sun computers, the companies said Monday.
2001-09-27 - Universities to get Itanium systems    Hewlett-Packard and Intel announced they will give $2.5 million worth of Itanium-based workstations and servers to 40 universities worldwide for research. Universities have been one of the primary testing grounds for Itanium, the 64-bit server chip designed by both companies to compete against products from Sun Microsystems. Seeding academic environments is often viewed as a way to build momentum for products in the commercial marketplace.
2003-05-05 - Unisys targets IBM on server price Unisys is taking the pricing offensive against IBM in the market for powerful servers based on Intel processors. The Blue Bell, Pa.-based company posted on Friday results of a new server speed test that the company says is evidence its new ES7000/540, released in April, is a better deal than IBM's x440. The results represent a reversal of fortune for Unisys, whose high-end servers were under pressure when IBM's competing models arrived in 2002. Unisys' ES7000/540 server, with 16 2GHz Xeon MP processors, posted a score of 181,000 transactions per minute on the Transaction Processing Performance Council's widely watched TPC-C test. That score is a notch ahead of the 151,000 transactions per minute that IBM posted in March with a system that had the same number of processors running at the same clock rate. In addition, Unisys' system cost $1.1 million compared with IBM's $1.7 million. The speed test results represent the latest shift in an expanding and fast-changing market. Servers based on Intel processors were a market worth $16.4 billion in 2002, according to research firm Gartner. The research firm also expects spending on Intel servers to exceed that on Unix servers in 2003 for the first time. Unisys is a close partner of Microsoft. The two companies together have launched an attack on the high-end server market currently dominated by machines running various versions of Unix. However, with the arrival of Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Intel's 64-bit Itanium processor, designed for heavier-duty computers than the 32-bit Xeon, more companies are getting into market that Unisys had largely to itself. IBM is planning a 16-processor Itanium server, NEC a 32-processor model, and Hewlett-Packard a 64-processor system.
2002-07-17 - Unisys splits Intel server line    Unisys, a specialist in high-end servers, is coming out with a new lower-cost line of Intel-based servers as it gears up to promote the Itanium 2 chip. Unisys' new Aries servers accommodate as many as 16 Itanium 2 or Xeon processors and cost between $75,000 and $300,000, said Mark Fevertson, Unisys' vice president of server marketing. It joins forces with the 2-year-old Orion line, which can use up to 32 Xeon or Itanium 2 processors and is priced between $140,000 and $700,000. For the guts of the new lower-end server line, Unisys adapted technology from Intel beyond just the processor, Fevertson said. To join the processors to each other, to memory and to communications components such as network cards, Unisys uses a modified version of Intel's E8870 chipset. Unisys augmented the chipset with its own components to permit communication among 16 processors; Intel's standard design permits up to eight processors. Unisys is backing Intel's sustained effort to become the dominant manufacturer of chips for servers, networked systems that typically run 24 hours a day and whose administrators have little tolerance for crashes or data corruption. The Itanium 2, a 64-bit chip that can handle vastly more memory than 32-bit processors such as Xeons or Pentiums, is being built into servers that will compete against machines from Sun Microsystems and IBM that can cost more than $1 million and contain 16 or more chips. The first Itanium 2 servers are coming out this month. By contrast, Xeon chips, which are enhanced versions of the desktop Pentium III and Pentium 4 chips, sell in servers that cost less, but account for far more volume. Most Xeon servers contain four or fewer processors. Unisys tried unsuccessfully to encourage other Intel server makers to sell its ES7000 designs under their own labels. The company signed agreements with Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer, but all those agreements fell by the wayside. Most other Intel server companies have so far used Xeon more conservatively, using them in smaller machines while using their own RISC processors in their most complex boxes. The closest competitor to Unisys today in this regard is IBM, whose Enterprise X Architecture (EXA, code-named "Summit,") design currently is used in eight-processor Xeon servers and later will be in 16-processor Itanium and Xeon servers. Hewlett-Packard has delayed work to build an eight-Xeon server. Dell is working with Intel on a new version of the E8870 chipset for eight-processor Xeon machines. The high-end Intel server market gets spicier when looking at Itanium designs, though. Itanium co-inventor HP has extensive plans for high-end Intel servers based on its "Pinnacles" design. And Itaniums are at the heart of several higher-end Intel servers from SGI, NEC, Groupe Bull and Hitachi. Dell has spurned Itanium 2 for now. Unisys' Xeon models are available immediately, and the Itanium 2 models will be available in September or in early October, Fevertson said. They support Windows 2000 and will support Windows .Net Server coming later this year. The Unisys systems can be partitioned to run independent operating systems, a useful feature when consolidating several servers into a single centralized machine. Partitioning first arrived in high-end mainframes and in recent years has trickled down to Unix servers, with Intel servers the next vanguard. The Orion series can be split in to as many as eight four-processor partitions, but the Aries may be split into a maximum of two partitions, Fevertson said. While Orion systems with Xeon chips can run as a single 32-processor partition, the largest Itanium 2 partition has 16 chips, Fevertson said.
2003-04-21 - Unisys readies multifaceted server With a new heavy-duty Itanium 2 server running the forthcoming Windows Server 2003, Unisys is putting another marker down in its gamble on Intel-based systems running Microsoft software. The server, its ES7000/560 model, which can accommodate up to 106 Intel processors, is unusual among Itanium 2 server designs in that it unites several architectures that large enterprises might otherwise use in separate servers. The maximum configuration comes with a single partition for 32 Xeon processors and two 16-processor partitions for Itanium 2 processors. Businesses also can add up to 42 blade servers. The ES7000/560, with its official launch set for Thursday, follows by just a few weeks the release of the ES7000/500, which runs up to 32 Intel Xeon processors. It will make its debut the same day as Windows Server 2003, which will have its coming-out party at a San Francisco gala hosted by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Intel sells the Itanium 2 processor for use in high-end systems and Xeons for midrange servers. The two chips run different software. Mark Feverston, Unisys' vice president of platform marketing for enterprise servers, described the approach as "betting everything on Windows Server 2003." The ES7000/560 uses what's referred to as CMP, or cellular multiprocessing, technology that allows business customers to partition the system so that several operating systems can run simultaneously. The feature could appeal to people consolidating several servers into one, where 32 processors might be assigned to a higher-importance level database application and 16 to running, say, a separate database application. Prices start at $250,000. Unisys will begin selling the ES7000/500 on Thursday, but models with Windows Server 2003 Datacenter Edition won't ship until June. One of the customers buying into the Unisys approach is New York-based JetBlue Airways, which started moving many of its critical back-end systems to ES7000 servers about six months ago. Budget-minded JetBlue, one of just a couple of profitable airlines, is big on standardization--it has settled on a single aircraft, the Airbus A320 (it has 41, with plans to add 12 more by the end of the year). CIO Jeff Cohen is bringing that approach to technology management as well, moving most operations to Microsoft software and consolidating on ES7000 servers. The switch to Unisys servers is part of "a model where we were going to scale up rather than scaling out," Cohen said. JetBlue had been following a more clustered server approach, adding new systems as demand grew--one database application might spread from a single server to as many as 16 servers. "From an administration perspective, that was pretty difficult," Cohen said. "If the application failed, it was difficult to tell where the problems were. So from a manageability perspective, it was more difficult; from an administrative perspective, it was more difficult; and in the end, from a scalability perspective, it was more difficult." JetBlue started with a beta, or test, ES7000/560 server, later adding an ES7000/500. The airline plans to soon replace a Hewlett-Packard rx5670 Itanium server with another ES7000/560 for running its frequent-flyer program. All the servers run Windows Server 2003 Datacenter Edition--the 32-bit version on the 500 and the 64-bit version on the 560. Power enough to persuade? Even with satisfied early adopters on its side, Unisys faces tough going convincing large customers to make the move to Windows Server 2003. "I wouldn't expect many customers to seriously consider moving to Windows Server 2003 much before 12 months after release," IDC analyst Al Gillen said. "Many customers will want to do their evaluation and testing first, and that could take some time for them to do." In addition, Windows Server 2003 lacks the sophisticated kind of management tools commonly found on large-scale enterprise servers. Microsoft is revamping its system management software, but that process is expected to take three to five years. To help fill the gap, Unisys released its Sentinel management software in March 2002. The company offers versions for server, application and database management. Unisys updated Server Sentinel last month. Sentinel and similar management tools are often referred to as "autonomic" software, because they attempt to monitor and respond to changes on the server the same way the human nervous system does to stress. The software is designed to be self-healing, automatically repairing common problems such as memory leaks or software demanding too many resources. Sentinel can shut down a server in the event of hardware failure and restart with fewer processors or memory chips. It also sends to service personnel an alert about the problem and notifies Unisys technicians that a piece of hardware has failed. A tool such as Sentinel is important, if Unisys hopes to woo customers concerned that Windows is not truly enterprise-ready. "They aren't the only ones to develop these kind of tools," D.H. Brown analyst Rich Partridge said, "but what Unisys is offering is a consolidation vehicle that is fairly easily managed using them." Good management features for Windows NT Server 4 customers could be important for companies considering a move to version 2003. Microsoft estimates that about 35 percent of Windows Server customers run 7-year-old version 4. Both Microsoft and Unisys executives have expressed their belief that this group will be the most likely to move quickly to Windows Server 2003. Unisys, meanwhile, has to contend with the dominance of competitors such as IBM and HP. In terms of worldwide server shipments, the Blue Bell, Pa.-based company finds itself in the "other" category, ranking a lowly No. 21 in fourth-quarter 2002 market share, according to Gartner. But in server revenue, Unisys made a much stronger showing, capturing the No. 6 position. All told, the server maker has sold about 1,000 ES7000 systems, which are in use in about 45 countries, according to Unisys. Seventy-five percent of systems are sold with 16 or more processors, and 18 percent replace Unix servers or mainframes. About 60 percent run Windows 2000 Datacenter Server, and 80 percent run Microsoft's SQL Server database. Around 40 percent of ES7000 servers go to new customers.
2002-10-16 - Unisys lands deals for Windows servers Unisys, a company selling high-end Intel servers that run Microsoft Windows and compete with Unix systems from Sun Microsystems and others, has found two new customers for its 32-processor ES7000 server. Fortis Health bought three for its core insurance business, one with an eight-processor partition using Intel's new Itanium processors for analyzing numbers, Unisys said Tuesday. Itanium systems with Windows are putting new pressure on Unix servers, the mainstay of high-end business servers. In addition, Unisys will collaborate with the Cornell Theory Center (CTC) on putting ES7000 servers to work in supercomputing applications. Two systems will be used, one with Itanium processors and one with Intel Xeon processors. The Cornell Theory Center also has a deal with Dell Computer to assemble lots of lower-end servers into a cluster that acts as a single supercomputer.
2004-10-27 - Two records in one day for SGI supercomputer   MOFFETT FIELD, Calif.--Even as Silicon Graphics Inc. trumpeted on Tuesday a new speed record with the Columbia supercomputer it built for NASA, CNET News.com has learned, it quietly submitted another, faster result: 51.9 trillion calculations per second. During the unveiling of the Columbia supercomputer, SGI touted a speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second, or 42.7 teraflops. That handily beat the machine at the top of a list of the world's 500 fastest machines, NEC's Earth Simulator at 35.9 teraflops, as well as a top challenger, IBM's Blue Gene/L at 36.0 teraflops. The 42.7 teraflops speed used only 16 of Columbia's 20 servers. That means that 2,048 of the 10,240 Itanium processors in the supercomputer weren't being used--and the unused chips are the newest generation of Itaniums, each with 9MB of high-speed cache memory, SGI Chief Executive Bob Bishop said. SGI clocked the full 20-server system at a sustained speed of 51.9 teraflops, according to a source familiar with the test. On a secondary but still scrutinized measurement, peak speed, Columbia ran at 61.0 teraflops, a smidgen ahead of the 60-teraflop speed Intel President Paul Otellini predicted in September. Full results in the closely watched competition are released every June and November at supercomputing conferences; the newest Top500 list will be released Nov. 8, organizer Jack Dongarra said. Despite the interest in the list, its organizers and others recognize that the speed test, called Linpack, is a convenient but incomplete performance measurement. SGI's higher speed gives the Mountain View, Calif., company more of a lead over IBM, but Big Blue's score was performed Sept. 16, leaving plenty of time for upgrades and new speed tests. SGI declined to confirm or deny the statistics, and Dongarra declined to comment.
2006-08-14 - Turning server communication inside out    Sun Microsystems and a handful of computing companies have taken crucial first steps in delivering to the world a flexible new way to plug network cards and other adapters into servers. The technology, called PCI ExpressModule, is an extroverted version of the ubiquitous PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) standard that until now has been hidden away inside computer cases. Traditional PCI cards are naked electronics boards that fit into slots inside a computer's chassis, but PCI ExpressModule uses cartridges that slide into external slots. The technology promises to ease the lives of server administrators who need to add or replace cards without opening up the computer, removing it from its rack or shutting it down. ExpressModule adapters cost more, though, and their advantages are likely to have little appeal for those using lower-end servers. If Sun has bet correctly, it will have desirable products on the market ahead of rivals and could restore some of its reputation as a "hot box" manufacturer. But if not, it could be punished for foisting more expensive technology on its customers. "Sun is probably betting that the ecosystem is going to create itself and that Sun will be there early to take advantage of some of the unique capabilities," said Ideas International analyst Rich Partridge. But it's always difficult to turn new input-output standards into mainstream technology: "It's a hard, steep curve to climb up." And Sun won't have any help, at least for now, from the other two major manufacturers of higher-end servers, IBM and Hewlett-Packard. ExpressModule "hasn't had much adoption in the industry," so IBM is still only evaluating the technology, said Jeff Benck, vice president of product development for IBM's x86 and blade servers. And HP won't use it in its x86-based ProLiant servers and has no imminent plans for its higher-end Itanium-based Integrity models. "At this point, the reliability, availability, serviceability, manageability and density of ExpressModule do not demonstrate sufficient benefits beyond the standard PCI-Express form factor, which offers lower cost and wider product selection," said Brian Cox, worldwide director of server platform marketing for HP's business critical server group, in a statement. But Sun expects minds to change. "I think it's going to take another year before we see (usage) go up dramatically," said Graham Lovell, senior director of systems at Sun. "I think it's going to go mainstream in the big four suppliers"--meaning IBM, HP, Dell and Sun--he said. The chicken-and-egg problem Input-output standards move glacially compared to the rest of the computer market, and the work in building support for ExpressModule has only begun. The ExpressModule debut is a classic example of the who-goes-first, "chicken-and-egg" problem that's common with new technology introductions. "You need the platform to develop the cards, but the platform needs the cards. It's going to take a little bit of getting there," said Al Yanes, chairman of the PCI Special Interest Group (SIG) that oversees all PCI specifications. But Yanes is optimistic that Sun's move will help the ExpressModule fortunes. "Sun's a big player. Hopefully that's going to jump-start the technology," he said. "We're hopeful that others will endorse it." The PCI SIG released the ExpressModule specification in April 2005, scrapping the former Server I/O Module name. But PCI ExpressModule didn't become a practical reality until July 2006, when Sun announced its Sun Blade 8000 server, one of several designs led by respected computer engineer Andy Bechtolsheim. There are some adapter eggs to go along with the server chicken, Lovell said: Qlogic and Emulex will supply dual-port Fibre Channel adapters; Intel plans two- and four-port gigabit Ethernet adapters; Mellanox plans dual-port InfiniBand network adapters; and Myricom "and others" plan dual-port 10-gigibit Ethernet adapters. Now that Sun has staked its claim, "We're hoping that it's going to catch the attention of the other server vendors. "It's a great feature on midrange servers and up," said Frank Berry, vice president of marketing for QLogic, which offers dual-port adapters for connecting servers to Fibre Channel storage networks. New circuit boards must be designed for ExpressModule, Berry said, but the main engineering--the custom processors, software drivers and on-board firmware--is the same. "All that's portable to the new design," he said. Adaptec, a major manufacturer of adapters for connecting to storage systems, doesn't have ExpressModule models. But it's a fan nonetheless. "We do like the technology. We looked at it as a way to add cards to a server without having to bring the server down. Anything that increases the uptime for servers we're supportive of," said Paul Vogt, director of product marketing. Conventional PCI has technically permitted customers to add or change cards while a server is running--"hot-add" and "hot-swap" in server jargon--but in reality the idea is too impractical. "There were huge concerns about that--about the danger of having the machine on while taking the cover off," Vogt said. Mass market? Few doubt ExpressModule has benefits in higher-end servers, whose lifespans last many generations of upgrades and which customers are more reluctant to shut down. But the mainstream market is another question. Sun is bullish on the idea, though its lower-end products don't use it, at least for now. Lovell expects PCI ExpressModule to be used in dual-processor, rack-mounted machines as small as 3.5 inches thick--the single most popular area of the server market in terms of unit shipments. But HP, the top maker of x86 servers, will take some convincing. The industry effectively voted against ExpressModule as the PCI standard plug-in method when it decided how to move from conventional PCI to the faster PCI-Express (PCIe) technology now becoming mainstream, said Dwight Barron, chief technologist for HP's BladeSystem. "If the industry was going to move to this modular format, the time to have done it was when we made the transition to PCI Express. The industry voted loud and clear. PCIe happened, and we're on the same kind of cards we've been on for a long time," Barron said. The computing industry is several years into its transition from PCI to PCI-Express, a new version that offers faster connections through high-speed "serial" communications lines rather than the synchronized "parallel" links used in older PCI. While servers today still often use an extension to PCI called PCI-X, lower-end servers have begun the transition to PCI Express. The ExpressModule is "a relatively a niche product," and HP doesn't have plans to use it in its ProLiant servers, Barron said. And that lukewarm stance ultimately could mean ExpressModule fans won't see their products coast to easy widespread acceptance. "If HP and IBM don't make use of this, I'm not sure it withers on the vine," said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff, "but it certainly is a much smaller market than regular PCI-Express cards."
2000-03-16 - TurboLinux unveils system for Intel's Itanium chip TurboLinux has become the first company to release a test version of the increasingly popular Linux operating system for Intel's delayed Itanium chip. The version, at this point a very raw collection of the Linux kernel along with bundled software and a less inconvenient installation, is significant for companies who want to move their software to Linux and Intel's future flagship chip design. Although TurboLinux was the first, it likely won't be alone for long. The other major Linux sellers--Red Hat, SuSE and Caldera Systems--are expected to come out with their own versions soon. Even Microsoft is paying attention; it was one of the companies that downloaded the TurboLinux OS, said Lonn Johnston, TurboLinux vice president of corporate communications. Linux, barely known in the computing industry two years ago, has emerged as one of the three premier operating systems that Intel is backing for the launch of the Itanium chip. Intel has been among the most aggressive investors in Linux, taking equity stakes in several young Linux companies as a way to give the operating system the seal of approval of the dominant chipmaker. "It never hurts to get out there first," said Microdesign Resources analyst Keith Diefendorff, but the more significant software development for Itanium is the compilers. Compilers, which translate programs written by people into instructions a chip can understand, are vastly more important with the Itanium chip than with other designs. Linux, an operating system based on Unix and rapidly embraced by the computing industry, is a key part of Intel's push to establish its Itanium chip, the first in its "IA-64" family. The chips will allow computers to store huge databases entirely in memory and enable faster mathematical calculations. Intel hopes Itanium and the later members of the IA-64 family will carry it into high-end computers that currently use chips from IBM, Sun Microsystems, Compaq, SGI or Hewlett-Packard. The Itanium chip has been delayed several times and is widely viewed as a first-generation product that will be used to debug software rather than to run critical computer tasks. But even months before the first systems built on Itanium arrive, it's already a dominant part of the computing landscape, with all the biggest hardware companies backing it. Most have higher expectations for Itanium's successor, code-named McKinley, which will offer higher performance and will arrive in late 2001, when companies have had more time to remove bugs from IA-64 computers and software. The number of operating systems available on Itanium has dropped. Compaq canceled its program to bring Tru64 Unix to Itanium. SGI decided to use Linux for the new chip. And IBM, Sequent and the Santa Cruz Operation decided to merge their versions into a single package called Monterey-64. The maturity of the Itanium operating systems will have a powerful influence on how well the chip design is received and how fast the chips wrest market share from the competing designs of Sun Microsystems, Compaq, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and SGI. The three-person "Frontier Group" at TurboLinux has three Itanium machines, early prototypes from Intel. Though the computers tend to crash when pushed hard, the effort is going better than expected, said Uros Prestor and Robert Read. During a three-day period, the Frontier Group prepared 350 different software packages in five days in an effort to get the alpha version of TurboLinux for IA-64 out. But using new-fangled, crash-prone hardware under such intense conditions is a mixed blessing, Prestor said. "It's always exciting being on the cutting edge. But during crunch time, we would take out the Nerf gun and shoot the machine," he said. For Linux, IA-64 offers a free ride into a more upscale neighborhood. Linux currently is most popular on less powerful 32-bit Intel chips, with versions for 64-bit chips such as Compaq's Alpha and Sun's UltraSparc far less common. IA-64 could be a way for Linux to become more popular in more powerful servers. "I think it's potentially very important," VA Linux Systems chief executive Larry Augustin said in an interview Wednesday. In particular, IA-64 Linux machines with large amounts of memory will be useful for serving up Web pages quickly, he said. The Trillian project to bring Linux to Itanium began at Hewlett-Packard more than two years ago and now involves numerous hardware companies. The Linux sellers themselves got involved in December. The Trillian project members released the core of Linux for IA-64 to the public in February and the first compiler two weeks later. A month ago, SGI--a hardware company moving its high-end servers and graphics machines to Linux--promised it would release its own compiler by the end of February. That compiler still hasn't shown up, though it's eagerly awaited, Prestor said. The current IA-64 compiler, GCC from Red Hat's Cygnus team, works very well when compiling software for lots of different chips, but it doesn't produce particularly fast software, said Prestor. SGI's compiler is expected to produce software tuned to run much faster. HP and Intel each have their own compilers for IA-64 as well. Diefendorff expects HP's will offer the highest performance. "If anybody is ahead on this, it is probably HP," he said. HP invented the IA-64 architecture and joined with Intel to make sure the design wouldn't be relegated to a small market. Though ostensibly an open-source project in which anyone can see and modify the original programming instructions, most Trillian work happens with the original teams, said Eric Sindelar, business development manager at VA and leader of VA's Trillian team. "All these hardware issues are still under NDA (non-disclosure agreement)," he said. "In early-level systems and software, you can't detach the operating system debugging from the hardware debugging." Diefendorff expects Itanium chips to arrive in late fall. Intel has said the chips will first run at speeds of 800 MHz. "I don't think the performance of this first generation is going to create a demand pull. It will mostly be an Intel and HP push," he said. But Intel's marketing and pricing efforts, combined with the longer-term potential of IA-64 and the existing support from computer makers, will mean success. "For the large-volume server market, it looks like IA-64 is unstoppable at this point," he said.
2000-06-02 - TurboLinux to name new CEO amid layoffs    TurboLinux will announce today a new chief executive, the second major change this week after Wednesday's layoffs. As earlier reported, founder and former chief executive Cliff Miller will remain chairman, while president and chief operating officer Paul Thomas will take over as CEO, the company said. "I'm going to be chairman, focusing on strategic issues, being a spokesman,...looking at markets and technologies. Paul is going to continue running the company operations," Miller said in an interview. In another change, the TurboLinux board has a new member. A veteran of the computing industry, Gordon Eubanks is currently the CEO of Oblix, and formerly held the top spot at Symantec. Linux companies have suffered some hard times of late. TurboLinux announced layoffs Wednesday as a way to cut expenses and force the company closer to profitability. The move was a less drastic step than the measures taken by LinuxCare, which laid off a large fraction of its staff and withdrew its plans for a public offering. The CEO shuffle and the layoffs are "completely unrelated," Thomas said. He and Miller had planned the CEO change for weeks, and the board approved the move this week after Miller's suggestion, Thomas said. "We knew from the start this is what we'd like to do," he said. The move parallels a CEO shuffle at TurboLinux competitor Red Hat, which in November transferred the CEO mantle from Bob Young to COO Matthew Szulik, with Young staying on as chairman. Linux, a clone of the Unix operating system and competitor to Microsoft Windows, took the computing industry by storm last year, winning a place in the product lines of the biggest computing companies. That excitement helped fuel several stellar IPOs, including those of Red Hat, Cobalt Networks, Andover.Net and VA Linux Systems. Now, while Linux still is popular, breathless investors no longer assume it's a guaranteed road to riches. Shares in Andover.Net and Caldera Systems are trading below their IPO prices. TurboLinux has several points to its business model: selling Linux in Asia, where it got its start; tuning Linux to work well with major software packages such as Oracle database software; and joining together many computers in "clusters" that collectively tackle a single problem. It's also focusing on creating a version of Linux for Intel's upcoming flagship Itanium chip, due later this year. Eubanks led Symantec, best known for its fix-it software such as Norton Antivirus or Norton Utilities, from 1984 to 1999. He now runs Oblix, a computer security firm that helps companies control who has access to what computing resources. TurboLinux approached Eubanks and several others "to expand the experience and breadth of our board," Miller said.
2002-09-26 - Tridium snags 5 million    Software maker raised $5 million in a second round of venture capital financing, bringing total funding raised by the company to $25 million. Investors in the latest round of funding include Marubeni in Tokyo and K Road Ventures in New York. The Richmond, Va.-based Tridium, founded in 1995, makes software designed to aid in remotely monitoring building facilities and other kinds of equipment by linking tiny computers embedded in meters, thermostats and other devices over computer networks. The technology is used to monitor and control utilities usage and factory equipment.
2001-01-03 - Transmeta to help AMD push into servers    Advanced Micro Devices plans to take on Intel in the server market, enlisting one of its own competitors to help out. Under a complex deal yet to be announced, sources say AMD is sending to software developers computers that run on competitor Transmeta's Crusoe processor and contain a special version of Transmeta's "code-morphing" software. The computers are designed to run a program that simulates AMD's upcoming server chip, called Sledgehammer, the sources said. In turn, Transmeta has obtained a license that will allow it to make chips that rely in part on the Sledgehammer design. The Sledgehammer simulator is crucial to AMD's plans to break into the lucrative server market. With a software simulation of the chip, developers can tweak their programs so they can release products when Sledgehammer emerges commercially in the first half of 2002. AMD will also come out with a version for desktop computers called ClawHammer, the company has said. Sledgehammer is one of AMD's most ambitious projects to date. The chip will process data in 64-bit chunks, rather than in 32 bits like AMD's Athlon processor. Sledgehammer also will allow computers to manage more memory than current PCs and servers. The chip will compete against the long-awaited Itanium processor from Intel. AMD takes on Intel Michael Kanellos, sr. editor, CNET News.com The licensing pact also is likely to be seen as a significant endorsement of Transmeta's code-morphing software. Code-morphing software translates instructions written for Intel- or AMD-based computers into Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) commands that can be understood by Transmeta's Crusoe chip and then back again. Transmeta has maintained that the translation process eliminates some of the burdens involved in chip design and causes only a minimal performance hit. Critics, however, have said that it is merely a form of emulation, a cross-computer form of translation that has never been satisfactory. By adopting the software for its development systems, AMD is essentially endorsing the technology. In fact, the company sent developers Sledgehammer simulators based on its own chips last fall, but they didn't work very well. AMD's Sledgehammer "simulator is quite slow. It runs at speeds like PCs 15 years ago," said a source with a software company, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Gartner analyst John Enck says AMD hopes that its new 64-bit product, code-named Sledgehammer, will provide the needed weight to break into the tough but lucrative server market. see commentary "Simulating a chip is a very expensive operation," the developer continued. "But Transmeta can take any x86 chip--and Sledgehammer is basically an x86 chip on steroids--and simulate it in hardware." Transmeta will also be able to make notebook chips that are compatible with software tailored to Sledgehammer. AMD and Transmeta executives declined to comment. Microsoft, Red Hat and Linux seller SuSE have all kicked off pilot programs to examine whether to write code for Sledgehammer. Representatives from Microsoft, which said earlier this year that it was evaluating Sledgehammer, said the company's position on Sledgehammer had not changed. Microsoft is looking at Sledgehammer but has not committed to writing software for the chip. Any deal involving Transmeta and AMD would be "complete news to me," said Michael Stephenson, lead product manager for Windows enterprise servers at Microsoft. "We still have nothing to announce" regarding Sledgehammer.
2002-10-25 - Torvalds Next Linux due by June    The next version of the heart of the Linux operating system is expected by June, project founder and leader Linus Torvalds predicted on Thursday. Scheduling the arrival of open-source software can be difficult given the informality of the collaborative programming process and the programmers' reluctance to release code that's not up to snuff. Indeed, version 2.4 of Linux arrived months later than hoped. But Torvalds and other key developers adopted a more structured approach for transforming the 2.5 "development" branch of the OS to the 2.6 version intended for real-world use. "We're pretty close to done with what will be 2.6...We're actually looking at the second quarter 2003 for the real 2.6 release," Torvalds told a group of Linux aficionados aboard a "Geek Cruise" in the Caribbean. CNET News.com reviewed a recording of Torvalds' talk. The more formal process makes it easier for companies such as IBM or Red Hat to plan products such as servers or operating system software for the new versions of Linux. Torvalds, the top programmer of the kernel at the center of the heart of the Linux software project, implemented a "feature freeze" for the 2.5 testing series, after which no new features will be permitted. The deadline is set for the end of October. Also, Torvalds said "early next year" will be the "code freeze," when the gates close for the software for those features. A pragmatic Finnish programmer who works for Silicon Valley chip designer Transmeta, Torvalds rose to celebrity status in programming circles for his work helping to create an operating system with enough clout to take on Microsoft and to win a major place in IBM's business plans. Torvalds has no shortage of opinions, but softens them by observing that he's been wrong before--for example, when expecting the demise of Apple Computer or the irrelevance of higher-end computers with multiple processors. Still, in his talk Thursday, Torvalds didn't pull many punches. "I never much liked Macs. All the interesting stuff is hidden away," he said, adding that he does like Apple hardware. Mac OS X is built on an open-source foundation--the Mach "microkernel" in combination with FreeBSD Unix--but Apple still keeps much secret about OS X's inner workings. "They made the base of the house open source, but all the rest of the stuff, the wiring, is their own stuff. I don't want that to happen with Linux," Torvalds said. Mac OS X "doesn't give me the warm-and-fuzzies. I actually dislike Mach a lot. I think they made a lot of bad design choices." Torvalds also griped about Intel's decision to push its high-end Itanium "IA-64" processors over its current Pentium and Xeon "IA-32" lines. The Itanium processor, codeveloped by Hewlett-Packard, is a 64-bit chip built to accommodate vast amounts of memory, but the commands it understands are drastically different from those understood by the 32-bit Pentium line. Torvalds said he preferred AMD's approach to 64-bit computers, keeping the same commands, or "instruction set," but adding 64-bit abilities. "I really dislike IA-64. I think it's a losing strategy," Torvalds said. "My personal hope is that IA-64 withers and dies because there's no point. It performs badly; it's expensive; it's an all-new instruction set." "The reason Intel was so hugely successful was they went for the mass market, for normal users. They went for all the things that Intel stands for today," he said. AMD is staying truer to that philosophy, he said. "I find AMD's approach a lot more interesting, which is to replace a 32-bit Athlon with a 64-bit Athlon...They come from below and eat up all the high-performance big computers." Intel and HP don't dispute that Itanium is very different, but argue that a radical revamp was required to create a new architecture that would last decades. In addition, they argue, the chip comes with features for protecting data integrity, pumping data on and off the chip more rapidly and working better in large computers with multiple processors. 2.6 or 3.0? Top Linux programmers had been debating whether changes would be grand enough to warrant naming the next version 3.0, but Torvalds called the next version 2.6. These programmers typically don't conduct such debates in person, preferring instead to trade ideas, code and sometimes acerbic remarks on the Linux kernel mailing list. In addition to the feature and code freezes, Torvalds is making other changes that underscore the growing maturity of the Linux development process. In February, he switched the management process for the vast repository of Linux code from a free-wheeling model to the more formal BitKeeper software. Torvalds said he picked BitKeeper because it doesn't relay on a single, central repository. Under BitKeeper, "Every developer has a complete BitKeeper repository, and they're all equal," Torvalds said, an egalitarian structure that dovetails with Torvald's belief that every contributing programmer should be a "first-class citizen." BitKeeper also helps Torvalds gradually share more power in governing Linux with other top programmers, he said. In Linux' earlier days, Torvalds said, "My interest was wide enough that it made sense to have one person do the (Linux) release management. It turns out that as the kernel grows, the size of my interest stays fairly constant, which has made it less and less relevant to the whole kernel, which is why I'm trying to cultivate all these people who help me do all these parts of the kernel." Indeed, as the Linux kernel expands, much of Torvalds' job increasingly involves rejecting badly written code. "My job is to say no, to some extent. If you keep things clean enough and have some kind of requirement for what code can look like, you're already ahead of the game," he said. The BitKeeper move irked some, including Richard Stallman, a MacArthur Foundation "genius grant" winner whose work cloning Unix and founding the Free Software Foundation provided a launching pad for the Linux movement. BitKeeper is proprietary software, a closed product that runs contrary to the shared development model Stallman began and Torvalds embraced for the Linux kernel. Torvalds said Thursday he'd prefer to use an open-source equivalent, but there is none. "I'm hoping that some people in the open-source community will see the light and stop pushing CVS (the Concurrent Versions System code management software) and try to do a BitKeeper-like thing instead," he said. The biggest software change for the 2.6 kernel, Torvalds said, is an overhauled "block device" software, which governs how data is sent to devices such as hard drives, flash memory and CD-ROMs. "The block device layer was too broken for words," he said. The changes required an overhaul to all related "drivers," the software that communicates with specific hardware devices. Updating the drivers for the block device changes is probably the main source of crashes in the current test version of Linux, Torvalds said. Other than that, the new version "looks fairly stable," he said. Of Linux penguins and blind hens Linux development might be becoming more formal, but Torvalds believes there are limits. For example, he argues against planning sessions where programmers chart out grand futures, he said. "I think a lot of things I don't like tend to be overdesigned," he said. "To me it's bad. Somebody spent too much time thinking and too little time doing." Linux programmers tend to be more free-form, with enough programmers trying things out so that eventually someone comes upon the right approach. "If you have enough people going out and trying it, it's like this blind hen approach to finding food, sometimes you just get lucky," he said. "There is no grand scheme." "The major architectural idea in Linux is to have this notion of where you want to go--preferably you get some input from something that has worked before, like Unix--then you have tons of people who have their own crazy wacky ideas, and you hope that the klutziness evens out," he said. One of the chief advantages of the open-source method of sharing code publicly is that programmers are ashamed to expose poorly written code for all the world to see. "In Linux," Torvalds said, "you probably fixed the worst warts even before you put them in the code."
2002-06-13 - Top-end server group comes home to HP  In the early 1970s, a Hewlett-Packard employee named Jimmy Treybig left the company and founded ultrahigh-end server maker Tandem Computers. More than two dozen years later, the company he started has returned to those HP roots. Tandem--whose high-reliability servers can be found running the New York Stock Exchange's transaction system and America Online's login and e-mail systems--lost its independence when Compaq Computer acquired it in 1997. And now, with HP's acquisition of Compaq, Tandem has become HP's NonStop Enterprise Division. That works for Treybig. "If you'd asked me in 1994 who I wished would acquire Tandem, it would have been HP...I loved HP," said Treybig, who left Tandem before the Compaq buyout. The success or failure of HP's integration of what was once Tandem will be a litmus test for some of the advantages HP has promised from its $19 billion merger with Compaq. HP plans to move its NonStop servers to Intel's Itanium processor, hopes NonStop sales will tow along sales of lesser HP machines to prestigious accounts, and stands to benefit from NonStop services revenue. Early indications of HP's integration approach will be visible Wednesday, when the company will announce new NonStop systems, the S76000 and S86000, sources familiar with the plan said. The new systems will come with faster processors, quadruple the memory capacity, and better networking abilities than the S74000 introduced in 2000. NonStop servers, which can accommodate thousands of processors, handle some of the world's most demanding tasks--running the security systems of New York's three major airports, for example, and ATM networks for several major banks. Competition comes chiefly from rarefied systems such as Sysplex groups of IBM mainframes. NonStop systems almost always cost more than $1 million, according to IDC analyst Jean Bozman, and in 2001, NonStop servers accounted for 8 percent of the $11.9 billion market for servers priced at those levels. "It's always nice when the company across the street acquires you." --Pauline Nist General manager of HP's NonStop Enterprise Division The former Tandem's servers pulled in $1.2 billion in revenue in 2001--probably $1.5 billion including services--according to Pauline Nist, general manager of the 1,500-person division. That's a comparatively small fraction of the $81 billion in total revenue HP and Compaq collected that fiscal year, but NonStop servers give HP a foot in the door for new deals. "We're always going through the customer list looking for cross-selling opportunities," Nist said, and now NonStop can take greater advantage of the fact that the systems are often paired with HP's Unix servers. Geography will help. The Compaq division that Tandem became was, and is, based in Cupertino, Calif., right across the street from HP's Unix server group. "It's always nice when the company across the street acquires you," Nist said, adding that she relishes the fact she'll no longer have to fly to Compaq's Houston headquarters. And the NonStop could boost HP's other servers, products under fierce competition from Dell Computer, Sun Microsystems and IBM. HP and its inherited Tandem team have an "engineering simpatico," a heritage of building finely crafted, elegant machines, said Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice, and if HP is smart it will learn from the Tandem team. "If HP is successful," Eunice said, "they will do the same thing IBM has done with bringing mainframe technology to its pSeries (Unix servers): They will adopt it and say, 'Please teach us how to do this.'" Hoping history won't repeat itself Treybig and others in the Tandem community believe HP will do a better job than Compaq in supporting and benefiting from the Tandem systems. "I think Tandem is better being a part of HP than Compaq," Treybig said, deriding early Compaq decisions such as using a PC sales force to hawk Tandem's gigantic systems. Under Michael Capellas, though, things got better. Tandem under Compaq initially was a "disaster," said Gary Bonhiver, a 24-year Tandem consultant and president of GoodWinter Database Architects who has helped customers such as Safeway, Wells Fargo and John Deere use the systems. But HP has better prospects. "Compaq just didn't know how to sell them," Bonhiver said. "HP, I think, has a much better reputation in the industry. It's not received just as a PC maker. They know how to market and sell major systems and already have connections within the large corporations." Yves Rouchou, chairman of the ITUG user group for NonStop customers, saw Compaq's efforts change for the better. "At the beginning with Compaq it was very difficult, but they improved after one or two years," he said. "We think the new HP understands the needs of the big enterprise." Rouchou has more than passing curiosity for the success of the server line: He runs a NonStop 74000 system at the heart of the Euronext stock, bond and commodity trading system for France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Rouchou has been working with Tandem systems for more than a decade, but many NonStop community members have been around longer than that. The early years Treybig got the idea behind Tandem while still working at HP, where he became a salesman for HP's first 2116 computer systems after joining the company right out of Stanford. His boss was marketing chief Tom Perkins, who left to form pioneering Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner & Perkins, now Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Perkins is also Tandem's former chairman and was a Compaq board member. Treybig followed Perkins, and became Kleiner Perkins' fifth employee, spending two years there working on the Tandem idea. At HP, Treybig saw customers lash two HP servers together so one would take over if the primary system failed. These customers would replace the standard operating system with custom-built software, causing all sorts of support problems. Treybig thought such a setup could be created with standard computer hardware and software, replacing these exotic one-off systems. "You could build an operating system that wouldn't fail and would be standard software," Treybig said. But to make the idea feasible, the systems had to be designed with the goliath input-output capabilities of mainframe computers, he said. "I used to dream Tandem failed and HP put me in a cage in its front entryway." --Jimmy Treybig Tandem founder Treybig launched Tandem in 1974, with half the first 18 employees coming from HP. He also hired three gurus to design the system. Mike Green had also been at HP, where he had created its first time-sharing computer, a system that could work on several jobs simultaneously by quickly switching between different tasks. Jim Katzman, too, had been at HP but had become head of mainframe maker Amdahl's input-output work. And Davie Mackie had been working on custom systems for discount retailers in Europe. "The three of them put together the architecture of the Tandem. There's still nothing like it," Treybig said. Indeed, Illuminata's Eunice said, Tandem succeeded at an extremely difficult task, one nobody has yet been able to do as well. Tandem's technology can simultaneously distribute a gigantic database across numerous independent processors while supporting high volumes of transactions. "Tandem's the only one who whacked at vastly parallel databases and was able to do online transaction processing at the same time," Eunice said. But Tandem couldn't sustain its early growth. By the mid-1990s, revenue had flattened out at about $500 million a quarter, and Tandem had undergone rounds of layoffs, cutting hundreds from a staff that had grown to 9,500. "In the early days," consultant Bonhiver said, "Tandem had much better growth because there were so many different kinds of (computer systems) out there, it didn't stand out as this weird, niche platform. Now everything is all Sun or (Windows) NT and some mainframe." Hewlett-Packard never offered to buy Tandem, but it's clear HP was always in the back of Treybig's mind. In fact, recurring visions of HP would come to Treybig in his sleep. "I used to dream that we failed, and (HP) put me in a cage in the front entryway," Treybig said. "It was my nightmare." Treybig initially proposed a buyout to Compaq, thinking Tandem couldn't survive on its own and that Compaq's thrust toward services and direct sales matched Tandem well. But Compaq wasn't interested at the time, and Treybig left Tandem in 1996, the year before Compaq changed its mind. Treybig now is a partner at Austin Ventures in Texas. The next phase The products coming next week were developed during the Compaq years, but HP will oversee a much bigger product launch as the NonStop servers are rebuilt around a new processor. The S76000 and S86000 coming next week will both use the MIPS R14000 processor, a chip designed by struggling server maker SGI. Future systems, the S78000 and S88000 due in 2003, will use a faster MIPS chip, HP said. The big change will come in 2004, when NonStop releases systems code-named "Yosemite" using Intel's new Itanium family of processors, a product line HP invented before handing the design to Intel to commercialize. In 2005, the Yosemite systems will be upgraded so the operating system takes advantage of the Itanium's 64-bit design. The Tandem machine has had a rocky road when it comes to switching to a new processor. In the 1990s, the Tandem team had planned to switch to the Itanium line and was actively helping Intel settle design requirements. But things changed under Compaq, which directed a switch to the respected Alpha processor when it acquired the Alpha along with Digital Equipment in 1998. But when Compaq deep-sixed the Alpha a year ago, the remnants of the Tandem team had to abandon their years of Alpha development work and dust off the old Itanium plans. "It's a bit of back to the future," the NonStop division's Nist said. Fortunately, though, Intel preserved the features that the Tandem machine needed, including the ability for two processors to run in lockstep, checking each other's work. Much of the HP advantage will come through the Itanium connection, Nist said. HP is building Itanium Unix servers and has critical technology such as the ability to run Java server programs and "compiler" software--software that translates human-written programs into instructions computers can understand. "We've been lusting after their compilers for years," Nist said. "On Sept. 5, the day after the merger was announced, my compiler people wanted to go across the street" to talk to the HP compiler teams. And with HP's clout, the NonStop ne Tandem team also will have more sway in persuading Intel to build features it needs into Itanium processors, Nist added. Itanium holds the promise of systems that use more standard hardware, thus permitting more standard software and lowering overall prices. But some fear there could be performance problems. "Itanium will definitely lower the cost per transaction," said Thom Birdsell, president of FTS Unlimited, which has for 20 years connected Tandem programmers with companies needing work done, more recently branching out to sell some types of Tandem systems. But Birdsell has concerns that Itanium won't work as well as the Alpha in large systems. "If you'd asked me in 1994 who I wished would acquire Tandem, it would have been HP." --Treybig The Itanium NonStop systems will be phased in gradually, with HP selling the S78000 through at least 2005 and supporting the MIPS-based systems through at least 2010, HP said. And the new Itanium systems will run older software with no changes, a strategy Tandem employed when it moved to the MIPS line in 1990. Other server components are changing as well. The "ServerNet" technology that links processors with one another and input-output systems will be improved with each generation of new systems. Storage systems also will be able to use the StorageWorks line that HP sells with its other server lines. The ZLE challenge Another challenge for HP will be grappling with the "Zero Latency Enterprise" initiative spawned at Compaq to use a Tandem system to stitch together a large company's other databases--letting a change made in one be reflected instantly in another. ZLE could join formerly disparate databases for projects involving manufacturing process control, customer buying records, product support or Web site sales. "There's been a lot of confusion out there in terms of what exactly ZLE is," Birdsell said. Airline reservation company Sabre Systems and retailer Target both have used ZLE, and Nist said the idea's potential helped to sell many systems, even if customers haven't yet used it. "I would say ZLE was probably to some significant degree responsible for our ability to grow the business" in 2001, in which revenue increased 4 percent when the overall server market shrank dramatically. And the pressure is on for NonStop to continue to deliver. Overspending in the manic dot-com years has punished its two biggest markets: financial services and telecommunications companies. Birdsell says he now sees offers for about five Tandem jobs per week compared with about 25 a week in the late 1990s. ZLE has been aimed chiefly at telecommunications and retail companies, but HP will push it into manufacturing companies now, Nist said. The poster child for the effort will be HP itself, which is dovetailing HP and Compaq manufacturing systems with a single NonStop server. How well HP manages tough business decisions will be crucial to its merger success, Treybig said, speaking from personal experience. "Hopefully (Carly Fiorina) knows how to fire," he said, referring to HP's plan to cut 15,000 jobs as a result of the merger and the limping economy. "Basically, you've got to get your costs to your revenue level. Some CEOs see that and do it, and some don't. If you don't, you fail."
2000-02-16 - Tools help Linux make strides with new Intel chip  The effort to bring Linux to Intel's next-generation Itanium chip moved forward today with the arrival of critical programming tools, another key step for the upstart operating system. Linux distributor Red Hat today released the crucial software--called a "compiler"--that translates programs into instructions that can be understood by Intel's upcoming 64-bit Itanium chip. The move comes at a time when a similar development effort between Sun Microsystems and Intel has turned into an ugly spat. Itanium is the first member of a new class of more powerful processors from the chipmaker. Hardware maker SGI said it will release its compiler as well, promising that its version will result in faster programs. Relatively few Itanium computers exist, because the chip is still available only in prototype form. But the arrival of compilers is important. It will enable the worldwide group of programmers who collectively develop Linux to take the first steps in making sure the open-source OS and all its components work on Itanium machines. With the compilers, developers will be able to start testing software drivers for countless network cards, hard disk arrays, video systems and other essential hardware components. Linux, a clone of the Unix operating system and competitor to Windows, is growing increasingly important in Itanium plans. Intel has invested in Linux companies such as Red Hat, SuSE, TurboLinux and VA Linux Systems, and now Dell Computer is warming to Linux in favor of proprietary versions of the Unix OS. "The proprietary Unix world is giving way to the open-standards world," said Carl Everett, senior vice president of Dell's personal systems group, in an interview yesterday. Earlier this month, a coalition of companies released the first version of Linux for Itanium, code-named Trillian. The SGI and Red Hat compilers will be released as open source, meaning that anyone may modify the workings of the software. Both packages will be released under the Gnu General Public License, which means theoretically that the two compilers could be merged. Compilers are a critical ingredient for the Itanium chip. Much of the performance gain that's expected from Itanium will only become a reality if compilers can line up instructions in just the right way so that the chip can operate efficiently. And compilers also are an essential tool for getting higher-level software, such as databases or e-commerce software, to work on the new chip. "For this architecture, you really need a great compiler," said HP's David Mosberger in an interview earlier this month. Mosberger has been working on Linux for Intel's upcoming chip families for two years. Mosberger said Linux compilers work about as well as other compilers, but that there's "a lot of head room to optimize them better in the future." The Linux news comes as Sun has run into trouble bringing its Solaris operating system to the new chips. Intel said it will offer only minimal help to Sun because Sun wasn't doing enough to encourage software companies to use Intel chips instead of Sun's own UltraSparc chips.
2003-09-10 - TI to pay Intergraph 18 million    Intergraph on Wednesday said Texas Instruments will pay a one-time $18 million licensing fee as part of a settlement ending all patent litigation between the two companies. Under the agreement, TI will license three Intergraph patents that describe how a chip can process instructions in parallel. Intergraph had argued the technology was an essential component of TI's digital signal processors, its flagship product. A TI representative was not immediately available to comment. The settlement is the latest legal victory for Huntsville, Ala.-based Intergraph, which has won hundreds of millions of dollars in litigation from patents relating to its defunct Clipper microprocessor, a chip that was once touted for its technical capabilities but that failed to achieve market success. Last year, Intergraph settled two suits with Intel, which resulted in a combined payment of $450 million. In one suit, Intergraph claimed that Intel's Pentium family infringed its patents, and in the other, it alleged that the Itanium chip infringed other patents owned by Intergraph. Intel could also be on the hook for an additional $100 million, depending on the outcome of an appeal in the Itanium case. Intergraph has subsequently gone after PC makers that use Intel's chips, filing suit in December 2002 against Dell, Gateway and Hewlett-Packard. In that suit, filed in federal court in Texas, Intergraph alleges that the three PC makers violated its patents because the companies sold computers containing Pentium processors. Trial is scheduled to begin Aug. 2, 2004, Intergraph said. Similar suits may be pursued against other PC makers, the company has indicated. Independent patent consultant Rich Belgard, who is not involved in the TI-Intergraph suit, said the settlement appeared to be a good one for both sides. The technology claimed under the Intergraph patents is "very important to TI's DSPs," Belgard said. At issue in the litigation were the same two patents that Intergraph has asserted against Intel's Itanium chips, relating to technology known as parallel instruction computing (PIC) or very long instruction word (VLIW). The patents cover technology for speeding up calculations by simultaneously assigning various instructions to multiple execution units within a processor. "A lot of bogus patents are coming out of the U.S. patent office these days," Belgard said. "These are not bogus." George Schwab, an attorney with Townsend and Townsend and Crew in San Francisco representing Intergraph, said the work done on the Itanium case helped smooth the way for a rapid settlement. "The fact that the patents have been through a trial and a decision, and through a claims construction, clarified things that normally you'd think would be big question marks," Schwab said. Once a workstation manufacturer, Intergraph has come to rely heavily on litigation and intellectual-property licensing and has set up an intellectual-property division to better manage its legal affairs. In 2002, the company reported revenue of $501 million. Income from operations came to $10.4 million. Net income including legal settlements came to $377.1 million. "The settlement with Texas Instruments continues to demonstrate the strength of our patents and the effectiveness of our IP division," Intergraph CEO Halsey Wise said in a statement. Also on Wednesday, Intergraph said a judge had dismissed a countersuit from HP, although Belgard said he believed the company has leave to amend and refile its suit.
2005-10-14 - This week in Intel CNET News.com got a look at Intel's confidential road map, which shows plans for a dizzying array of single- and dual-core chips for 2006. Performance-enhancing features such as hyperthreading, 64-bit functionality, execute/disable and virtualization will appear together, separately, in varying combinations or not at all, depending on the chip and the type of computer in which it will be used. Of course, chips will vary by speed, cache size and bus speed. The chipmaker's first round of Viiv entertainment-branded PCs will be included on Intel motherboards code-named Bad Axe, Palm Canyon and Bear Canyon. Each motherboard will include LGA775 packaging for 3.60GHz and higher processor frequencies. These computers will rely on the upcoming Yonah notebook chip. Yonah, a new notebook chip coming from Intel early next year, will run slightly faster than expected, but may also consume more power than its contemporaries. Intel road maps indicate the next-generation Pentium M will debut at speeds up to 2.16GHz and possibly 2.33GHz--slightly faster than the 2GHz or less anticipated by sources in August. Yonah will also come with a 667MHz bus, which is a channel for ferrying data between the processor and memory; today's Pentium Ms feature a 533MHz bus. Yonah chips, though, will carry higher maximum-power-consumption ratings than current Pentium Ms. Most likely, that's because most Yonahs will sport two processing cores, rather than the single core found in today's notebook chips. Intel is expected to begin the introduction of its "Montecito" processors with three models running at 1.6GHz and 1.4GHz, but by the end of the first half of next year, at least six more are scheduled to arrive. The plan also shows an even broader portfolio of Xeons, a vastly more popular server chip that, unlike Itanium, can run the same software as other x86 chips such as Pentiums. The road map also shows that Itanium clock speeds will get a 200MHz boost from the addition of Intel's new "Foxton" technology, which lets chips run faster as long as they don't get too hot.
2002-07-03 - The week in review WorldCom's apology  A week after WorldCom revealed one of the largest accounting scandals in history, CEO John Sidgmore went to Washington to apologize and to pledge that financial irregularities are in the company's past. In his first public appearance since the announcement of the $3.85 billion accounting scandal, Sidgmore acknowledged that there has been an outpouring of outrage and anger directed at his company and promised to do whatever was necessary to regain the public's trust. Sidgmore met with Securities and Exchange Commission President Harvey Pitt, who had blasted the company for giving the SEC a "wholly inadequate and incomplete" answer when asked to account for how the intentional accounting error took place. Meanwhile, WorldCom said it has received notice that it defaulted with some of its creditors. Lenders for its $2.65 billion and $1.6 billion senior unsecured credit facilities may begin asking for immediate payment, the company said. When trading of the stock resumed this week, WorldCom shares fell 92.4 percent, or 77 cents. In the chips Intel's upcoming Itanium 2 processor will come out at 900MHz and 1GHz and cost about the same as existing Itanium chips. In all, Intel will release three versions of the 64-bit chip for high-end servers next week: a 1GHz version containing 3MB of level-three cache memory, a 1GHz version containing 1.5MB of cache, and a 900MHz version containing 1.5MB of cache. Prices will range from about $1,300 for the 900MHz version to $4,200 for the 1GHz version with the 3MB cache. Current Itanium processors sell for between $1,177 and $4,227. Intel was dealt a setback when Dell Computer, the largest PC maker in the world, said that it had no definite plans for Itanium 2 servers and would not be on hand when Intel unveils the chip next week. "At this point, we are in a bit of a wait-and-see mode with Itanium 2," a Dell representative said. Dell's reluctance comes down to demand. The company is still in the process of gauging how popular the chip will be with customers. Unlike other Intel chips, the Itanium family requires completely new software, and the software is just now being developed. Apple's crop The widely anticipated update to Apple Computer's Mac OS X will appear earlier than expected, which is good news for the company in a tough year. The new version, code-named Jaguar and officially known as Mac OS X 10.2, is now expected to ship in early August, barring unforeseen difficulties. In May, Apple indicated the operating system would ship by the end of summer, which many analysts took to mean the end of September or even October. Though Jaguar's debut might not make for huge revenue gains, an early release would give Apple a chance to squeeze out additional sales in a year when consumer spending has been flat. The back-to-school season--the second-biggest period of the year for PC sales and one of Apple's busiest seasons historically--runs from late August to the end of September. Apple also began shipping its Xserve rack-mounted server, which runs Unix-based Mac OS X. Apple says that it has received a healthy crop of early Xserve orders--more than 4,000. Each unit can support up to four 120GB hard drives; the PowerPC processors come with 2MB of level-three cache memory for throughput of up to 4GB per second; memory is expandable to 2GB; and the software package includes the Apache Web Server and QuickTime Streaming Server. Apple is singing a new tune with the acquisition of Emagic, which makes production software for professional musicians. Emagic's most popular product, an application called Logic, is used by more than 200,000 musicians worldwide. Apple has significantly beefed up its stable of software for creating multimedia and movie special effects for its Macintosh technology. Last month, the company acquired video graphics software from Prismo Graphics. Earlier in June, it bought digital effects software from Silicon Grail.

2001-03-31 - The week in review Network misconnections  Analysts and investors grew pessimistic about a quick recovery in the networking sector as more equipment makers revealed that earnings for the short term will be even more dour than thought. In its second earnings warning in as many months, optical equipment maker Nortel Networks said first-quarter earnings and revenue numbers will not meet previous expectations. The company now expects to report a loss between 10 cents and 12 cents a share on revenue of $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion. Nortel had earlier expected to report an operating loss of 4 cents per share on revenue of $6.3 billion. Nortel last cautioned investors of troubles Feb. 15. As more network equipment makers warn of trouble ahead, analysts wonder what the future holds for industry bellwether Cisco Systems. Based on Cisco's stock movement, Wall Street believes the company may be the next to issue bad news. The stock hit a new 52-week low this week. But not all signs reflected the gloomy warnings. After three repricings, shares of Agere Systems, Lucent Technologies' chip spinoff, finished its first day of trading slightly higher than its $6 offering price on heavy volume. The IPO of Agere ended an exhaustive effort by Lucent to complete the deal in the face of a gloomy stock market and an uncertain outlook for the optical industry. And Cabletron Systems said it sees no reason for analysts to change their fiscal first-quarter expectations. "I am very pleased with our fourth-quarter momentum and continue to be optimistic about our future prospects," Cabletron CEO Piyush Patel said. Executives of the holding company for network equipment and services vendors said they remain comfortable with consensus earnings estimates for its fiscal first-quarter ending in May. Analysts surveyed by earnings tracking company First Call predict a first-quarter profit of 8 cents per share for Cabletron. CEO search engine Former BMG Entertainment head Strauss Zelnick has turned down an opportunity to take the helm at Yahoo, citing major challenges facing the company, sources close to the matter told CNET News.com this week. The refusal, which came less than a week into a high-profile executive search to replace outgoing Chief Yahoo Tim Koogle, underscores the difficulties the company faces in filling its top position from outside the company. Yahoo this month began searching for seasoned chief executives in the media and technology industries to turn the company around. Novell's outgoing chief executive Eric Schmidt has invested an undisclosed sum in Web search engine Google and signed up for a part-time gig as chairman of the up-and-coming company. Google co-founder Sergey Brin will relinquish his chairman title, although he will remain as president. Co-founder Larry Page will remain in his role as chief executive. Analysts said the announcement indicates that the closely held company is beginning to leave behind its image as an immature dot-com. Besides high-level vacancies, high-tech companies also may have to face a morale issue in the ranks as well. Employees are getting smacked with exceptionally large tax bills this year because of a collision between how stock options get taxed under federal law and the slide in the stock market. Under the Alternative Minimum Tax, tech workers who purchased options in 2000 but didn't sell them that year have to pay taxes in 2001 on the shares' value on the date they were purchased--even if the stock has since plummeted, as so many did in the last year. Many people are paying taxes on what are now worthless options. Some executives are looking at tax bills of more than $3 million dollars. Windows shopping Microsoft announced the second test version of its Windows XP operating system and the first version that shows off the new look and feel of the software. Beta 2, which Microsoft said will be given to roughly 500,000 testers, adds a brighter interface with more graphics and colors as well as built-in support to simplify tasks such as online photo printing and managing music files. Windows XP will come in three flavors: one for home computers, another for most business uses, and a third aimed at machines running Intel's 64-bit Itanium family of chips. PC enthusiasts looking to grab an early copy of Windows XP may be in for a big surprise, however. Many will need more computing horsepower to run the operating system. Microsoft's Web site recommends a minimum 300MHz Pentium II processor and 128MB of RAM to run the Windows XP beta, up from a 133MHz processor and 64MB of memory for Windows 2000. Although many PCs come with 128MB now, machines sold a year ago, especially budget PCs, typically came with much less memory. With the next version of its consumer Windows operating system, Microsoft is trying to make computers less daunting and less prone to crashes. To reach that goal, Microsoft not only needs to clean up its own code, but also all the third-party drivers--little bits of software that help the system communicate with peripherals and other add-ons. When computer owners using Windows XP try to install new hardware or software with drivers that have not passed Microsoft certification, they will get an ominous warning message. Sweet and sour Apples Apple Computer's Mac OS X launch shook the earth for many of the company's die-hard fans last weekend. But aftershocks may cause some Mac enthusiasts unexpected trouble. Limited hardware support and a potentially flawed firmware upgrade could sour some people's first experiences with Apple's first complete overhaul of its OS since its 1984 introduction. Common problems include connections to SCSI devices and external hardware from Classic mode, something Apple had prepared people for. In addition, many Mac OS X owners must reboot back to Mac OS 9.1 to use America Online. Less than a week after OS X's release, Apple is preparing an update to the new operating system to fix some bugs. It's unclear whether the Mac OS X update--which CNET News.com obtained--is a final or a beta version. Apple would not comment on the update circulating on the Web, other than to say it is pirated. It is the company's policy not to discuss products before their release. After applying the update, the OS version changes from 10.0 to 10.0.1, or build 4L5. Apple bucked sluggish retail notebook sales in February, with sales up 31 percent year over year. Apple's Titanium PowerBook G4 led the rally, accounting for 52 percent of the company's notebook sales, according to a new report from NPD Intelect. February was the first full month of Titanium sales. Apple started shipping the notebook Jan. 31. Industrywide, retail notebook sales grew a paltry 2.3 percent in February, compared with the same period last year, according to NPD Intelect. "With the retail notebook market darker than expected, the one bright spot was Apple Computer," one analyst said.

2000-02-19 - The week in review Microsoft's landmark    Microsoft at last introduced Windows 2000, an ambitious attempt to make up ground in the high-end computing world. The business-use software, which the giant hopes will make inroads on the server computers that power Web sites while staving off fast-growing Linux, marks an industry milestone because numerous other companies are expecting to benefit as corporate buyers begin upgrading to the more robust system. Hardware manufacturers and chipmakers are expected to fare best; software makers and component suppliers can also expect benefits.Transition In the making since 1996, Windows 2000 is a great deal more sophisticated--and stable--than its predecessor, Windows NT 4. But the transition won't be smooth for about a quarter of those who make the change, according to a prominent consulting firm, and many companies will take their time. Additionally, licensing fees represent an incremental cost that can make the software expensive. Many predict the notebook segment will adopt the software the fastest because it is more reliable than previous Microsoft operating systems and exploits the best features of corporate notebooks, such as power management. Longtime partners Microsoft and Intel appear at odds over the key question of processor power needed to run Windows 2000. The latter asserted Windows 2000 requires up to 250 more megahertz of chip power for performance equivalent to Windows 98 or Windows NT. The pronouncement symbolizes the widening gap between the two companies, whose partnership has been so close that it has been dubbed "Wintel" within the industry. Microsoft also faces the twin challenges of Linux and the Internet, both unforeseen just a few years ago. The first has established itself as a cheaper alternative and been embraced by almost as many computer companies as Windows, altering the assumption that Microsoft would become the de facto choice for low-end servers. The second has boosted the market for Unix-based servers; in particular, Sun Microsystems has strengthened its position as the dominant choice for servers to power corporate Web sites. Microsoft contends Windows 2000 is more mature than Linux and less expensive than Sun's Solaris.Rivalry Intel is feuding with Sun: The chipmaker said that Sun hasn't been pulling its weight in a joint effort to develop Solaris for Intel's forthcoming Itanium chip and that it will drastically reduce the resources it's devoting to the project. Sun's UltraSparc chip is already established in the 64-bit processor market. Separately, Intel demonstrated a processor running at 1.5 GHz and said it will release Pentium IIIs running at 1 GHz or faster by the second half of the year. Intel and Advanced Micro Devices have been engaged in a game of one-upmanship since last summer, when AMD released its touted Athlon processor, and both have advanced their product "road maps." Magazines named for popular software, operating systems and program languages such as Linux and Perl are springing up in bookstores everywhere. While readership has been strong, the real engine behind the boom in tech trade publications has been advertising. Established players as well as start-ups flush with unprecedented venture capital investments are earmarking big chunks of their budgets for marketing. Asia's two-year PC crisis apparently is over, meliorated by the region's economic expansion and the rise of the Internet, according to a report. Shipments to China, Korea, Indonesia, India, Vietnam and elsewhere (but not Japan) rose to more than 14.1 million units in 1999, the highest annual figure ever and a sign that the regional economic downturn is on the mend.Just business An old guard of transportation, gas and other utility companies is contending with the ambitious new broadband industry over the wireless spectrum--the invisible, intangible "airwaves" that carry TV signals, radio waves and wireless phone calls. Owners of private systems typically used by taxi services, for instance, are asking federal regulators for more air space, while young digital outfits are fighting to win rights to the same air space so they can offer profitable new high-speed data and communication services. Since 1994, U.S. regulators have auctioned off large slices of spectrum to wireless phone and other companies, raising close to $20 billion in the process. Lucent insisted the company is fixing the problems that caused its first-ever earnings shortfall, considered by analysts as the most significant hurdle it has faced since spinning off from AT&T in 1996. Lucent's woes contrast with the runaway success of networking competitors Cisco Systems and Nortel Networks, as well as continued growth from a variety of start-ups. Nortel's October 1999 announcement that it would acquire Clarify predictably sent the customer relationship management company's shares soaring. But Nortel too has surged, buoyed by strong financial results and plans to expand. The Brampton, Ont., company, whose stock has more than doubled in four months, said it will spend $260 million and add 3,400 people to meet demand for its fiber-optic network equipment.Consolidating? Several executives involved in Time Warner's Internet efforts have resigned or been reassigned following the company's announced merger with America Online, renewing questions about the media and entertainment giant's online plans. The most recent move involves the chief operating officer at Time Warner Digital Media. Employee stock options in Time Warner instantly vested upon approval of the buyout, and seem to be contributing to an exodus of executive shareholders. Healtheon/WebMD agreed to buy Medical Manager and its subsidiary CareInsite, an Internet-based health care network for physicians, suppliers and patients, in a stock deal valued at roughly $5 billion. The Atlanta company has made a string of buys within the last month. Critical Path, hoping to persuade big companies to move their email, fax and other messaging services online, has decided to move its Net-based products offline for those corporations that still prefer to be in-house. The strategic switch marks a realization that the business market for outsourced communications isn't taking off quite yet. In a deal that consolidates the sluggish online bill-payment market, CheckFree agreed to buy Microsoft-backed TransPoint for in a stock swap worth about $1 billion. Consumers have been reluctant to embrace online billing because of its inconvenience--bill-paying services typically don't allow users to settle all of their accounts--and the move suggests that building the market may be more important than bare-knuckled competition at this stage of the game.Thinking about it Ask Jeeves scuttled a proposal to spin off its sex-related answers to a separate Web site called Mimi. The company had been mulling its sex strategy for months, toeing a fine line between endangering its family-friendly brand and giving up a source of traffic and revenue from the popular and lucrative online pornography trade. Internet advertising network DoubleClick acknowledged an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into its practice of collecting consumer information, and a separate probe by Michigan's attorney general. In recent weeks, federal officials have launched inquiries into some of the top names in online business, including Amazon.com, eBay and eToys, as consumers spend increasing amounts of time and money online--and file record numbers of complaints. Canadian law officials investigated a Montreal-based Internet service provider in search of an anonymous hacker called "mafiaboy," while universities that were taken over and used in last week's attacks on sites including Yahoo, eBay and CNN said they can't guarantee their systems won't be used as launching points again. President Clinton met with Internet executives to discuss the situation.Also of note Apple announced a revamped line of notebooks for professionals, an upgraded iBook for consumers and faster chips in its corporate desktop computers ...

2001-06-30 - The week in review Microsoft survives intact   Although Microsoft claimed victory after an appeals court this week vacated an order to split it into two companies, legal experts say it may be too early to name a winner in the landmark antitrust case. In a 125-page decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld a previous ruling that Microsoft used illegal conduct to retain its OS monopoly and asked a trial court to determine an appropriate remedy--tossing out the possibility, at least immediately, of a company split. The appeals court also asked the trial court to revisit the controversial issue of tying products such as the browser to Microsoft's ubiquitous PC operating system. For Microsoft, the decision puts it in the hot seat on a number of issues. For one, it potentially places in jeopardy the company's recent Windows XP bundling efforts and plans for .Net. The ruling could also expose Microsoft to huge legal liabilities in potential private lawsuits on behalf of consumers or competitors. In a separate issue, the appeals court said the trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, "seriously tainted the proceedings." It removed him from the case and tossed out his order calling for a Microsoft breakup. XP in turmoil Despite dodging a breakup bullet, Microsoft has a few more issues on its collective plate over the upcoming release of Windows XP. The company's new product-activation technology, which locks Office XP or Windows XP to a particular PC hardware configuration, can deactivate unexpectedly, rendering the software useless until a code number is obtained from Microsoft. The feature could present the biggest headache to people who frequently upgrade or change components on their PCs. Already the activation technology, introduced to thwart piracy and promote software subscriptions, is controversial with some users of the new Office software package. Separately, Microsoft is lightening the load on Windows XP by deciding to exclude Smart Tags--a technology that could alter the Web-surfing habits of millions of consumers--from the version to ship later this year. The company included Smart Tags in the most recent test versions of Windows XP, but a company spokesman said the technology will not be included in the final version that will be released Oct. 25. With Smart Tags, Microsoft can link any word on a Web page to another site chosen by the company. For example, if a person were reading a story about traveling, the word "airline" could include a link that would divert the reader to an airline or travel service chosen by Microsoft. Microsoft, together with Intel, PC makers and retailers, will spend $1 billion promoting Windows XP, the software giant's upcoming operating system. Microsoft and Intel alone will spend $500 million to market Windows XP, which is slated for an Oct. 25 launch, with PC makers and retailers spending another $500 million. Microsoft will spend a combined total of more than $700 million on marketing to launch Windows XP and the Xbox video game console this fall, according to estimates from the company and Merrill Lynch. Xbox is set to debut Nov. 8. Changing directions In a major boost to Intel's Itanium chip, Compaq Computer will license its Alpha chip technology to Intel and will use Itanium in its servers as the PC giant looks to consolidate its operations to focus on software and computer services. Intel, through the Alpha deal, will gain valuable intellectual property from Compaq for use in its chips and a major customer for its Itanium processor. As part of the deal, Compaq eventually will transition all of its server systems to use Itanium processors. In a radical change, VA Linux Systems announced it will stop selling Linux computers July 10, abandoning a business central to the company since its founding in 1993 and its phenomenal initial public offering in 1999. The company also will lay off 35 percent of its staff--about 153 of 436 employees. Leaving hardware means VA instead will work on Linux software, its collaborative programming tools, and its Web site. The move puts VA into closer competition with software specialists such as Red Hat and CollabNet. Napster is forcing people who want to trade music through its file-swapping site to upgrade to a severely restricted version that allows trading of only a fraction of the songs previously available. People who signed onto the site on Thursday were greeted with a message telling them their older software would no longer work. "All previous versions of Napster have been disabled," the message says. "We're making this change as part of our ongoing effort to comply with the court's orders." PC Expo: On the go There wasn't much PC in PC Expo this year, as portable computers and handhelds took over the convention floor. Aiming to restore confidence in his struggling company, Palm CEO Carl Yankowski announced several new deals designed to attract more corporate customers. Under one deal, Big Five accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers will begin recommending Palm handhelds to clients as a way to increase profits by making employees more productive. The two companies will work together to help businesses incorporate handhelds into their existing information-technology systems. They also will develop and market products that give companies mobile access to existing software such as customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning programs. Compaq is working to create the "iPaq Economy" by dramatically increasing the selection of add-on modules for the handheld. The PC company showed off several upcoming expansion packs, including those for a cell phone, GPS (Global Positioning System) and Bluetooth wireless communication technology. Compaq, not unlike competitors Palm and Handspring, is trying to create additional uses for its handhelds. Company executives hope that additional expansion capabilities will help create an effect similar to what Handspring accomplished with its Springboard expansion slot: drive sales by allowing its devices to be used in a number of new ways. Intel has moved forward in two major areas of the chipmaking process with "Tualatin," the new Pentium III processor the company showed off at PC Expo. Tualatin, also known as Pentium III-M, will initially be used mainly in notebooks. Intel executives said all of the major notebook makers, including Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Dell Computer, Fujitsu and Sony, will adopt the new chip. Tualatin uses Intel's new 0.13-micron manufacturing process, which allows smaller circuits to be printed on the chip, thus increasing the processing power that can be squeezed onto a piece of silicon. Tualatin also marks Intel's entry into the chip industry's copper shift, using the metal to connect circuits on the chip.

1999-12-11 - The week in review Linux stocks rocket The Internet mania which grips Wall Street seemed merely a prelude to the frenzy surrounding two Linux stocks that began trading this past week. VA Linux Systems, a company which sells computers based on the upstart operating system along with technical support and consulting services, set an all-time record for the biggest gain in the first day of trading. The company's IPO price was $30 per share, but the stock closed its first day of trading at 239.25--a phenomenal increase of 698 percent.Linux mania The jaw-breaking pop came one day after another Linux IPO, the debut of programmer information site Andover.Net, surged 250 percent. What is Wall Street thinking? Linux is comparatively little-used in the computing industry, except in server computers, where most think the so-called open-source software performs well. But the operating system's future growth could get a huge boost if it's deployed in conjunction with forthcoming 64-bit chips from Intel, which the giant hopes will power a new generation of even bigger servers. VA Linux is one of several companies involved in an effort to prepare Linux for the first of the new Intel chips, called Itanium, but the effort is about to gain steam with the addition of Linux sellers Red Hat, Caldera Systems, SuSE and Turbolinux, the companies that actually will sell the new version of Linux. Meanwhile, tensions over control of the Java programming came to a head. Creator Sun Microsystems backed out of a highly publicized effort to turn Java into an industry standard, which would have meant ceding some control to other companies. At the same time, IBM, Sun's biggest disciple in preaching the Java gospel, refused to support Sun's latest edition of the software, a version called Java 2 Enterprise Edition that's designed for use in servers.On the horizon Ericsson and Microsoft announced a joint venture to develop products that provide fast access to the Internet from any device. Ericsson will provide Microsoft with its Wireless Application Protocol format--which allows Net content to appear in the window of cellular devices--while adopting Microsoft's new Mobile Explorer package for Internet phones. The move is consistent with Microsoft's overall effort to expand as the high-tech industry turns from the personal computer to a variety of Net-based devices for communications. But the Redmond, Wash.-based software behemoth hasn't been the most successful in creating and sustaining alliances. Many companies have been jockeying furiously as the once-separate markets--software, telecommunications, handheld devices and e-commerce--continue to converge at a breakneck pace. With the first round of alliances and relationships to create products seemingly completed, the landscape looks remarkably familiar: Palm Computing and its allies vs. Microsoft and its camp.Another front Separately, in a speech highlighting the growing importance of streaming technologies, Microsoft chief executive Bill Gates said the company is investing significant resources into making it easier to see video and hear audio via the Internet. Some 45 companies backed Windows Media Player as their streaming media software of choice--including Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments and General Instrument--and joined Microsoft's Windows Media Broadband Jumpstart Initiative, a coalition of companies that support the software. At the same industry trade show, RealNetworks chief executive Rob Glaser reiterated his company's commitment to a hybrid identity as both a technology and media firm, outlining what he described as a streaming media "ecosystem" that provides technology for programmers and consumers as well as content services and aggregation to connect them. Real's vision of itself as a content aggregator stands in stark contrast to Microsoft's, which said it would not focus on streaming media content aggregation. Industry observers are skeptical on that point; Microsoft's determination to overtake Real is more certain. One day after blocking AT&T customers from accessing its giant instant messaging network, America Online agreed to sit down with AT&T and ally Tribal Voice to seek ways to end the escalating battle over access to the online giant's user base. The two companies agreed to meet early next year after Tribal Voice introduced a workaround. AOL previously battled Microsoft to a standstill on the issue, leading the software giant to throw in the towel on interoperability last month. In the war on bulk junk email, some companies are beginning to claim partial victories, and users are surprisingly backing those claims. Yahoo's anti-spam measure, launched last week, has met with some success. Hotmail's implementation has been more disappointing, users said. The Recording Industry Association of America sued start-up Napster for violating federal and state laws through "contributory and vicarious copyright infringement," because it has created a forum that lets online users trade unauthorized music files directly from their PCs. The lawsuit is the latest front in what has become a quicksand-like terrain for the music industry, which has been aggressively fighting to maintain control over their copyrighted material. In the case of Napster, it could be an uphill battle: At least two federal laws protect content "providers" from being held responsible for illegal activity over their networks.Shifting sands SAP chose IBM as its database of choice for internal development of its R/3 business application software on key operating systems, distancing itself from long-time database partner Oracle. Friction has been building between Oracle and its enterprise resource planning software rivals. AT&T plans to give high-speed Net access customers a choice of Internet service providers, announcing a deal with leading dial-up company MindSpring Enterprises. But the agreement doesn't go into effect until AT&T's exclusive contract with subsidiary Excite@Home expires in 2002. The move comes at a time when AT&T is waiting for a ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Portland, Ore., as to whether it can be legally forced to open up its high-speed network to outside ISPs. The decision comes just as Excite@Home had laid to rest some questions over its business strategy and future course. Two weeks ago, the company announced it would offer a tracking stock for its media assets, a move intended to quell rumors that the company might sell off Excite.com and other content properties. Separately, Excite@Home recently topped 1 million subscribers, meeting analysts' expectations and catapulting the company into a limited group of large, national ISPs. News Corp. formed a partnership worth more than $1 billion with Healtheon/WebMD. The financial terms include News Corp.'s providing $700 million in branding services over 10 years ($400 million domestically and $300 million internationally), a $100 million purchase of Healtheon/WebMD stock at $50 per share (making News Corp. a 10.8 percent minority stakeholder), a $100 million cash investment by News Corp. in an international joint venture; and a $62.5 million five-year licensing agreement for syndication of WebMD daily broadcast content. In a reversal of the usual trend to place traditional media content on Web sites, the media giant plans to distribute Healtheon/WebMD content across New Corp.'s television and print outlets.Think again Rambus named a new president and made other organizational changes as it prepares to launch into new markets, namely communications and other chip-to-chip applications. The company also disclosed a road map for existing chip technologies. Rambus' seemingly bright future darkened in September when Intel unexpectedly delayed a chipset that promotes next-generation Rambus memory, stunning many PC makers. Japanese consumers' preference for ever-thinner mobile computers and slimmer desktops that pack in moderate yet compelling features is influencing the design of products sold in the United States. PC makers including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq and Gateway are taking some cues from the world's second-largest market. Ted Waitt, the founder of Gateway, will step aside as chief executive on January 1 and hand over the reins to president Jeff Weitzen. Waitt did not say why he has decided to resign, but indicated that a transition has been underway for some time.Service, please Eleven major U.S. banks will join a consortium called Spectrum that operates an online bill-pay network. Formed in June by Chase Manhattan Bank, First Union and Wells Fargo, the network's new members include Comerica, Mellon Financial and Wachovia. Earlier this week, Sun Microsystems and Netscape announced plans to help Spectrum create an Internet billing system. About 63 billion bills are issued in the United States every year; companies that grab a significant share also can expect to sell other products and services because consumers tend to stick with their chosen financial institution. As e-commerce gains popularity, figuring out where to go for a redress of grievances can be just as frustrating as dealing with an uncooperative company. Problems ranging from missed shipping dates to outright scams ordinarily found offline now apply to the Internet. Additionally, even during this important holiday shopping season, many retail companies appear ill prepared for the perennial problem of handling customer phone calls. Calls made to online retailers' customer service centers can mean hold times of 10 minutes or longer--if you are able to get through at all, an informal survey by CNET News.com found. American television stations have joined the fight against Canadian Net TV company iCraveTV.com, demanding that the company stop showing their TV signals online or face legal action. ICraveTV, which launched early last week, streams the signals of 17 Canadian and U.S. TV stations online--uncut and uninterrupted. But the Web company didn't ask permission first, and now programmers on both sides of the border are trying to shut the young Net company down. The National Football League is also annoyed.Also of note IBM aims to build a $100 million supercomputer called Blue Gene that performs a quadrillion calculations per second--about a thousand times faster than the Deep Blue machine that beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov two years ago--to help researchers understand how proteins are created ...

2000-02-05 - The week in review Linux ever upward   Just as Comdex used to bring the PC world together, so it seems a New York trade show is becoming a focal point for Linux adherents and their ever-expanding initiatives. The startling buyout of a Linux media site that went public only two months ago and IBM's decision to incorporate the open-source software in one of its mainframe systems topped a busy week at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo. The gathering has grown rapidly in tandem with the widespread adoption of Linux, a clone of the Unix operating system and a competitor to Microsoft's Windows NT.Big deal Surprising everyone, VA Linux, which sells computers and services, acquired news and information site Andover.Net for more than $800 million, bolstering its efforts to lure corporate customers. VA hopes developers visiting Andover.Net for information will be steered toward buying VA's products. The agreement was negotiated within the space of a few weeks, according to VA's chief executive. But the speed at which Andover.Net moved from IPO to takeover target amazed even industry veterans. "This is unprecedented," one financial analyst said. "That deal went public a couple months ago and already they're tossing in the towel." In another landmark development, IBM previewed a multi-million dollar system running nominally free software. As part of its S/390 mainframe, Linux could be utilized by companies as big as Salomon Smith Barney or Schwab to speed up and better secure business processes ordinarily handled by smaller servers, Big Blue contends. Separately, a coalition called the Trillian project--including IBM, SGI and such leading commercial developers as Red Hat--released a version of Linux that works on Intel's next-generation microprocessors. The upstart operating system has much to gain from the 64-bit Itanium; however, Linux is new to the high-end market and Itanium isn't expected until the second half of the year, so it's not clear whether this will expand Linux's stronghold on 32-bit Intel chips. Meanwhile, Compaq announced new efforts to support Linux on its 64-bit Alpha chip platform. A bit lower on the food chain, "skinny" servers stacked up by the dozen are rapidly becoming the preferred way for PC companies to squeeze profits out of the popularity of Linux. Relatively low cost, high reliability and network-friendliness make the software a good choice for businesses that need lots of servers to handle tasks such as delivering Web pages or funneling requests to a back-end database. SGI, IBM, Penguin Computing and Network Engines, among others, announced new products that fit the mold.At last Vodafone AirTouch agreed to buy Mannesmann in a stock swap valued at $190.5 billion. The agreement ends Vodafone's three-month campaign for control of Germany's largest cellular company and makes it Europe's biggest phone business. If it goes through, the biggest takeover in history, surpassing America Online's pending $154.8 billion acquisition of Time Warner, would create a company with more than 42 million cellular customers. With about 10 percent of the world's mobile phone customers, the group could also dominate mobile Internet services. Qualcomm agreed to license its wireless voice and data transmission technology to China Unicom, the country's second-largest government-owned communications company, clearing the way for its CDMA standard to break into a lucrative market. The pact marks a significant win for CDMA, which has gained among North American carriers drawn to its efficient use of wireless spectrum and ability to carry data and Internet traffic at high speeds, but badly trailed the rival GSM standard in China, much of the rest of Asia, and Europe. Microsoft is negotiating distribution deals with Sprint PCS, AirTouch and others to boost its technology in the rapidly expanding market for wireless devices. The telecommunications companies would deliver a new version of Microsoft's Internet content service, dubbed MSN Mobile 2.0. Mobile MSN, launched last summer, pushes Net content such as news and sports scores to pagers and cell phones. Intel landed a deal to sell as much as $1.5 billion in flash memory chips to cellular phone maker Ericsson over the next three years, and the companies will co-develop flash products capable of storing code and data such as Web pages, email, voice and music. Both companies are looking to be part of future network services offering voice and Internet capabilities in wireless handheld devices.Expansion Gateway will expand its foreign marketing and sales efforts in the coming year, beginning by moving into Canada this month. A launch into Mexico will come later in 2000, according to executives. The move complements Gateway's transformation from PC manufacturing to providing more-complete technology packages incorporating software, training courses, ISP services and even networking equipment. PC makers in general are trying to counter the decline of computer prices. Flextronics, which manufactures PCs, servers and consumer devices for name-brand companies, bought Palo Alto Products, a design firm that helped create such popular products as 3Com's PalmPilot and some of the small, "designer" PCs that have recently emerged. Should the merger prove successful--and the "contract manufacturing" business continue to grow as it has--the PC market could be encouraged to divide into two camps: unknown companies such as Flextronics that actually make products and well-known firms such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard that focus on marketing and sales. Free-PC, which offered free computers and Net access to customers willing to accept on-screen advertising, wrapped up business after giving away some 25,000 systems. The company recently merged with low-cost leader Emachines, both of them having been at the forefront of the price war which transformed the consumer PC market. Customers who signed up for the deal and received a PC get to keep it, no strings attached, although the free Net service will end.The next step Traditional business software makers and emerging applications service providers are squaring off in the market for hosted software services. Oracle, SAP and PeopleSoft--expected to launch its own ASP next month--are building quickly for the same reason that telecommunications giants such as AT&T are investing in hosting centers that will house rented business applications: to nab new profits by providing customers with new Net-based services. KPMG incorporated its consulting unit, the first step toward a public offering. Such a move could serve as a litmus test for rivals Deloitte & Touche, Andersen Consulting, Pricewaterhouse Coopers and Ernst & Young. All of the "Big 5" accounting/auditing firms operate consulting practices that are struggling to find their place in the new Net economy, having lost executives to Internet start-ups offering lucrative option packages. An IPO could also build the company's image as a firm that can transform a Fortune 500 company's business into a Net play. Time Warner may be facing an early exodus of top executives who instantly became eligible to cash in all their stock options under an unusual but long-standing provision that took effect upon last month's takeover announcement by America Online. Employees with previously unvested options won't have to wait for the merger to officially close before exercising them. They can do so now. Amazon.com posted a wider-than-expected loss for the latest quarter but said its U.S. book business made money. Analysts had been watching to see whether the retail leader could turn a profit in its flagship segment, as it promised last year. But Amazon said it will continue expanding, and expects the current quarter's sales to be down from its fourth-quarter revenues because of the seasonal nature of Amazon's toys and consumer electronics businesses. Should that happen, it would mark the first time Amazon's sales have slumped on a sequential basis.Unhappiness A consumer advocacy group organized a protest against DoubleClick, encouraging the public to email complaints about the online marketing giant's privacy policies to the company and 60 leading clients. The Center for Democracy and Technology objects to plans to create a database of consumer profiles that would include each user's name and address; retail, catalog and online purchase history; and demographic data. In an email response, the company said it does not profile "health information, detailed financial information, information of a sexual nature and information on children" and will not link "personally identifiable information about a user to online behavior without first giving that user notice and the choice not to participate." Bulk email advertising--spam--is undergoing a quiet transformation as direct marketers implement more sophisticated techniques for better targeting messages to people who may actually want to see them. Advertisers have sought to gain permission from consumers before sending pitches, which has allowed them to tailor advertisements to an individual's preferences with impressive results. The industry has a long, long way to go in gaining the trust of email users, however. Students on university campuses that have banned Napster gained hope for circumventing blocked network access. After riling the software maker by posting instructions on how the controversial digital-music download system works, a Stanford University student published a tutorial for getting around school roadblocks. The music industry dislikes Napster because it says it fosters a black market; schools say it hogs bandwidth. Again bowing to pressure, eBay said it will ban new auctions of items that promote such groups as the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nation. Current listings will remain, however, and the online auctioneer will continue to allow items of "legitimate collectible" value, which must be at least 50 years old. Last year, eBay came under scrutiny for Nazi items. A trade group sued Sony Music Entertainment, alleging that the company is strong-arming retailers to point their customers toward its online shops. Brick-and-mortar chains are forced to stock CDs that contain Web links and include promotional material for Sony's e-commerce sites, according to the complaint.

2002-09-13 - The week in review Intel gets small    Intel is thinking small when it comes to the company's big plans for the future. The chipmaker used its Developer Forum to disclose technology changes and avenues of research that will direct the future development of its chips. The company confirmed that it is working on a multiple-gate transistor that is expected to increase the amount of electricity flowing through transistors and microprocessors and in turn boost their performance. Intel is also experimenting with silicon nanowires and carbon nanotubes, two structures made up of, respectively, self-assembling silicon and carbon atoms. After 2010, one of these technologies could begin to replace standard transistors and over time become the building block of chips. As chips continue to get less expensive, more powerful and smaller, computers and wireless connections will be embedded in everything, speakers told the forum. By middecade, Intel expects to be able to integrate radios onto ordinary silicon chips. As a result, wireless communications would essentially become free. The chipmaker is also working on performance-enhancing server technology known as hyperthreading for the desktop and technology for securing data on hard drives. Hyperthreading allows different elements of the chip, such as the integer unit for graphics processing and the floating-point unit for complex calculations, to be active at the same time, boosting performance by as much as 30 percent. On the security side, Intel's LaGrande is designed to prevent hackers or viruses from obtaining or corrupting data in a PC by placing a secure wrapper around selected hard-drive data, as well as around the keyboard, the display and the interconnects inside the computer. Currently, data sent to commerce sites is encrypted while traveling between a PC and a server, but it reverts to its original form on a hard drive. The company plans to cross a technology threshold midway through the decade by squeezing two Itanium chips onto a single slice of silicon. On higher-end networked server computers, two or more processors often share computing tasks. With chip manufacturing advances, chipmakers can unite pairs of processors so they're etched onto a single slice of silicon, making the chips less expensive. Broadband's new path AOL Time Warner is making sweeping organizational changes at its America Online unit in a bid to make that division more profitable and tighten its focus on broadband services. An overhaul had been expected for some time. Recently, former USA Networks executive Jonathan Miller was named CEO of the division, in a move that presaged the restructuring. Miller will now oversee the AOL brand, interactive marketing and AOL broadband. He added that he wanted to trim the operating levels in the company and move more quickly to turn around the business. Indeed, the stated focus on broadband has given some on Wall Street a shot of optimism. AOL, however, remains a blemish on the parent company. SBC Communications and Yahoo launched their long-awaited high-speed Internet access service. The DSL service marks Yahoo's most ambitious step to date into the Internet access business, sharpening its rivalry with its chief Web portal competitors: Both America Online and Microsoft's MSN service have melded content and Internet service for years, becoming the No. 1 and No. 2 dial-up service providers in the United States. After taking a severe blow from a weak online advertising market, Yahoo is pinning much of its turnaround on boosting subscription revenue. Although financial details of the SBC partnership remain murky, Yahoo will take a cut of subscription revenue and offer a percentage of all advertising sold through the partnership to SBC. Whether these changes actually translate into new business remains to be seen. Broadband hasn't attracted much in the way of corporate support. Corporations are cautious about using broadband Internet services in essential areas of their business, according to a new study. More than 20 percent of respondents said they would not use any type of broadband service in their main offices. It's a Wi-Fi world A new wireless standard five times faster than Wi-Fi took an important step as the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers said that a draft of the standard, 802.11g, had passed the first of several votes needed before it's ultimately approved. The IEEE said it intends to finalize the 802.11g standard by May 2003. The 802.11g network operates in the same radio frequency as Wi-Fi, but equipment using 802.11g can download files or access the Web at 54 megabits per second, compared with 802.11b's rate of 11 megabits per second. It is also more secure than Wi-Fi and is compatible with existing Wi-Fi networks. Networking groups are working on ways for Web surfers to roam on wireless networks--just as mobile phone users roam on cellular networks. The popularity of Wi-Fi has spawned a number of independent companies that offer wireless services, but it is difficult, and prohibitively expensive, for many customers of a Wi-Fi service to use the network of another. The barrier to wireless roaming lies not in technology, but in that carriers have only just started to iron out billing issues. The IEEE met recently to discuss how to jump-start Wi-Fi roaming, and the European Telephone Standards Institute is making a similar effort to encourage companies to explore Wi-Fi roaming. Even Intel is catching the wireless bug. The chipmaker is readying a PC card modem, code-named Calexico, that will contain the first 802.11b and 802.11a chips made by the company. The modem, which will come out in notebooks early next year, will let both PCs and notebooks connect to Wi-Fi wireless networks as well as to those that use the newer 802.11a standard. To encourage sales, Intel will also pair the module with its processors and chipsets and sell the entire package to PC manufacturers along with "reference designs," or hardware blueprints, a technique it has used to get into the market for chipsets and other components. Sept. 11 revisited As the country stopped to observe the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the medium that does interactivity best became a natural destination. In the past year, the Web has become a key place to communicate, commiserate and compile historical information surrounding the attacks. Soon after planes hit the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon, and another terrorist-hijacked plane crashed into the Pennsylvania countryside, the Web emerged as a lifeline for people looking to contact loved ones via e-mail or find the latest news. In the year since then, Web sites of all types have surfaced, preserving information in multimedia formats, archiving personal accounts and spawning new communities. As major Web publishers increased extensive coverage of the anniversary, some eliminated or cut back on advertising to avoid the appearance of profiting on the anniversary of the tragedy. Major ad buyers such as Coca-Cola, General Motors and Pepsico suspended all advertising on Sept. 11, and some media companies followed suit with similar, if less sweeping, plans. That sensitivity seemed to elude at least one virus writer who created a new e-mail worm that uses the terror attacks of Sept. 11 to lure victims. The worm has the subject line "All people" and appears to be from "main@world.com." But the programming is buggy, and it fails to work on many systems.

2000-08-26 - The week in review Inside Intel's plans for the future Intel stole the spotlight this week, showing off new chips for cell phones and handheld computers, talking strategy and predicting a rival's doom. Intel released details on the Pentium 4 and showcased new chips for cell phones and handheld computers. The Pentium 4 features a completely new architecture called "NetBurst" designed to handle tasks--such as data encryption, video compression or Napster-like peer-to-peer networking--that have grown in popularity with the Internet. The upcoming Pentium 4 will be more than twice as big as the Pentium III and approximately 28 percent bigger than anticipated, an increase that will boost Intel's manufacturing cost and limit the number of chips produced. Most initial Itanium chips will run at 733 MHz, slower than the 800 MHz expected, but there are a host of other high-end computer products to compensate for the disappointment. The chip's speed is a lesser factor than architectural improvements such as the 64-bit design that allows it to hold vast databases within memory. But the slower speed indicates difficulties with the manufacturing process for the large new chip. Intel will ratchet up the speed of its high-end Xeon chips to 1 GHz, which has more psychological value than practical utility because of bottlenecks talking to memory and other components in a computer. Xeons are used primarily in servers, the computers that are the brains of computer networks. Intel executives predict the peer-to-peer technology popularized by Napster could usher in the next wave of the Internet and, in the process, save companies billions of dollars by using computing power already in place. The chip giant and others have invested $9 million in a start-up that will make chips for the upcoming InfiniBand technology for high-speed connections among servers, storage systems and networks. Intel CEO Craig Barrett compared Sun Microsystems to communism, saying the server maker represents an increasingly outmoded way of doing business because it locks corporate customers into products or services from a single seller. "If (Sun CEO) Scott McNealy's model worked, communism would still be prevalent and challenging capitalism." You've got email Yahoo plans to let its mail account holders use data scrambling to protect the privacy of their email messages, marking a potentially significant advance for the mainstream use of encryption. When the system launches, it will let Yahoo Mail account holders send messages through ZixIt's SecureDelivery.com site. The deal will make Yahoo the first major portal to offer encrypted email. Network Associates confirmed that emails encrypted using its PGP software may be vulnerable to a sophisticated attacker. PGP--Pretty Good Privacy--is used by 7 million people worldwide. Some businesses use it to send confidential documents. Microsoft is "thoroughly investigating" a scenario in which expired Hotmail accounts are thought to provide an avenue for either malicious or unwitting appropriation of existing IM usernames and contact lists. One Hotmail user says he lost his account because of inactivity, and when he created a new account with the same name, he found that his old IM contact list lingered with the cleaned-out account. USA.net, which has powered WebMail since its 1998 launch, will lose its only major portal customer when Netscape Communications' Netcenter migrates its WebMail accounts to its own service this fall. Netcenter has 7 million account holders using USA.net-powered email and just fewer than a million using its new homegrown service. Dow Chemical plans to fire about 40 employees for allegedly violating the company's email policy by circulating violent or sexually explicit material. The firings follow a review of 6,000 email accounts conducted after a worker complained about offensive email. Chain of command After Larry Ellison almost died at sea in December 1998, the swashbuckling chief executive began wondering who would run Oracle if something were to happen to him. The answer is anything but clear. Many sources close to the company believe that, regardless of titles, Ellison will remain firmly in control as long he stays with the corporation. That question--as well as speculation as to who is running the $200 billion database powerhouse right now--has been a topic of conversation throughout the high-tech industry ever since longtime No. 2 executive Ray Lane abruptly resigned in June. Lane joined the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as a general partner because he will be able to spend more time with his family, as the nature of the VC industry is changing. "I'm trying to stay true to my goal of building balance in my life. I want to have more time with my kids," Lane said. After just three months in the job, Razorfish president Michael Pehl resigned. New York-based Razorfish, a consultancy for Internet strategies and Web site design, did not name Pehl's replacement. He will continue to work with the company on a consulting basis. A year following his ascension to CEO, Bob Bishop runs a very different SGI than predecessor Rick Belluzzo. It's been a gut-wrenching year of tough decisions, many of which put Bishop in the hot seat with investors and Wall Street analysts. Handhelds in hand Retail sales of handheld computers are set to double this year, granting the once geeky devices mass-market status. Sales of personal digital assistants (PDAs) from Palm and Microsoft are surging. PDA sales for this year already equal sales for all of 1999, with a strong holiday season around the corner likely to boost the numbers more. XScale--the successor to Intel's StrongArm chip architecture--will power future generations of handheld computers, mobile phones and the backbone of the wireless network. Intel said the new design will enable entirely new types of wireless devices that can be powered by a single AA battery, but the company would not discuss specific speeds. A possible shortage of parts means Nintendo won't sell Game Boy Advance until March 21 in Japan and next July in North America and Europe. Nintendo said the delay was caused by parts shortages, as sales of the Game Boy Color handhelds are still growing and monopolizing the supply of components.

2000-05-13 - The week in review IBM's missteps  IBM conceded a series of recent missteps but hopefully described plans for improvement. Meeting with financial analysts, chief executive Lou Gerstner acknowledged the company has been struggling mightily with desktops and server computers, key segments for the computing giant. Restructuring will lead to better sales, he asserted.Big Blue's discontents Topping the list of IBM's shortcomings: faster hard drives for large servers. "We were late; we screwed up the design," Gerstner said. "It cost us in the first quarter, and it's going to cost us again in this quarter." Server storage will account for as much as 75 percent of new corporate hardware spending, he said. News from the PC division hasn't been much brighter. The company called a halt to retail sales in the United States late last year, a move that produced a steep, 42 percent drop in the first-quarter unit sales. Industry share fell to 4 percent from 7.9 percent a year earlier. At the start of the week, IBM introduced its NetVista line to reverse the trend. IBM further bolstered its midrange server line as part of its continuing attempt to close ground on market leader Sun Microsystems. But the fast-growing segment is fiercely competitive. Sun promptly introduced innovative discounts for educational customers.Unrepentant? Microsoft said it would accept restrictions on its business practices if a federal judge dismisses a government proposal to break the software giant in two. Specifically, the company would allow PC makers more freedom to customize the "start-up screen," refrain from using exclusive contracts that encourage PC makers and Internet service providers to favor Microsoft products, and give software developers access to information essential to making their products work well with Windows, among other proposals. The government said Microsoft's apparent lack of contrition makes these empty concessions. In a related matter, a delay in ruling on the government's proposal seems likely. A Filipino computer student admitted he may have released the "Love" bug. The virus has been deemed one of the most destructive ever, affecting more than 600,000 computers and causing an estimated $2.5 billion in damage. Intel acknowledged a problem with components inside some Pentium III computers that causes systems to freeze. Released in November, Intel's "memory translator hub" is used by computer makers that want to incorporate the 820 chipset without using Rambus, a high-cost, high-speed memory technology. The problem could cost Intel several hundred million dollars to fix. Separately, Intel posted the microarchitecture for its upcoming Itanium processor in an unusual effort to make it easier for open-source programmers to build applications for the new chip. Linux appears destined to play a substantial role in the acceptance of Intel's first 64-bit processor.Cut rate Hewlett-Packard cut prices on its leading business PC lines by up to 21 percent. The company has been pulling closer to leaders Compaq and Dell, recently overtaking the latter as the fastest-growing manufacturer with first-quarter 2000 shipment gains of 67 percent domestically and 56 percent worldwide. Dell's quarterly revenues bested last year's figure by more than 30 percent, and its net income improved by more than 20 percent, taking the PC manufacturer well past Wall Street's expectations. The company credited sales of servers, storage devices and PCs associated with use and construction of the Internet. Sony's PlayStation2 will debut with a suggested price tag of $299 in late October, ahead of Nintendo's Dolphin and Microsoft's Xbox, due next year. The new unit is able to play DVD movies and audio CDs, but will not ship with a built-in modem. In response, Sega discounted its Dreamcast to $149. The company also is offering subsidies for customers who sign up for its Internet access service.Surging demand for flash memory, used to store data and programming algorithms in cell phones, digital cameras and MP3 music players, is creating a spiral of consequences for the industry. With sales expected to climb to $10 billion this year from $4.5 billion a year ago, manufacturers such as Intel, AMD, Atmel and Fujitsu are expected to reap substantial profits. At the same time, supply shortages are worsening, which may lead to product delays and rising prices.Self-inflicted The recent flap over whether Time Warner had the right to pull Disney and ABC TV programming from its cable TV systems has raised the question among cable industry leaders: Will the dispute have implications for the regulation of broadband Internet content? Separately, CMGI is rallying Internet companies to demand further government scrutiny of America Online's pending merger with Time Warner, citing AOL's refusal to open its instant messaging services to rivals. MP3.com offered an olive branch to the record industry, agreeing to remove all major-label content from its controversial My.MP3.com service. The company was sued in January by the Recording Industry Association of America and the five big music labels, and last month lost an important round in court. The fight over MP3.com's service has helped sketch how far Web companies can stretch the boundaries of copyright law as they seek to expand their offerings online. Napster said it blocked 317,377 user screen names that have been identified by Metallica as allegedly infringing on the rock band's copyrights, but let members know that they have a way to appeal their eviction. Meanwhile, a few tech-savvy subscribers figured out a way around the ban and started posting instructions for the others on Napster's online bulletin boards. Many political portals may lack sustainable business models to carry them beyond the November presidential election. Political information is generally free and advertising dollars aren't flowing in because traffic figures are low. Some predict that e-government sites will suffer the same fate as medical and health information services, which launched with a flourish but fizzled by the end of last year. Commercial email--mail selling products and services--is expected to increase 40-fold by 2005, with marketers spending about $7.3 billion a year to send it, according to a study. The average number of marketing messages online consumers receive per year was 40 in 1999, and may rise to more than 1,600 in 2005. Sixty-five percent of companies are spending up to 5 percent of their marketing budgets on email marketing, cutting into direct mail.Also of note Sun Microsystems boosted the speed of its popular Java software for desktop systems, but distribution challenges may slow adoption of the performance update ? Microsoft is nearing completion of Windows Me and is expected to release the new consumer operating system sometime in June ? The House voted to extend the ban on Internet taxes for five more years ? The Republican-led branch House also hopes to ease restrictions on the number of visas given to foreigners with technical skills, another move favored by the high-tech industry, but the Clinton administration is trying to finesse the issue ?

2002-07-05 - The week ahead Earnings appetizer  Following are some of the notable tech-related events scheduled for the week of July 8 through July 12. Tech watchers will get a taste of earnings news this week as industry stalwarts report their performance during the second quarter and set the tone for the upcoming earnings season. Yahoo will announce earnings Wednesday. Analysts surveyed by First Call expect the Internet portal to report earnings of 2 cents a share compared with 1 cent a share in the same quarter last year. Redback Networks also reports on Wednesday. Wall Street estimates the telecom equipment maker will post a loss of 17 cents a share versus a loss of 26 cents last year. Fellow telecom equipment maker Juniper Networks continues the mood on Thursday. Investors expect the company to lose 1 cent, down from the profit of 9 cents a share Juniper chalked up last year during the second quarter. The Internet faithful will get a sense of how the online advertising market fared last quarter. DoubleClick, a provider of advertising services for Web sites, will release earnings on Thursday. Stock watchers expect the company to post earnings of zero cents for the second quarter. DoubleClick lost 7 cents a share during the same quarter last year. Oracle reported earnings last month, but investors will still try to pick up some clues on the database software maker's financial health this week. The company holds its analysts' day this Wednesday. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, which means that Wall Street will watch closely for two data reports Friday that will give some hints on the mindset of the U.S. consumer. The Department of Commerce will release retail sales data for June, and the University of Michigan will announce figures on its index of consumer sentiment. The holiday-inspired inactivity on the conference front last week seems to have spilled over into this week. However, Jupiter Media Metrix will host Plug.In in New York City starting Monday and will try to lure tech enthusiasts back from the beaches. The event will address the future of digital entertainment such as music and movie distribution services during a year that saw many file-swapping services crumble under the weight of entertainment industry lawsuits.

2000-08-22 - The PC is not dead I believe this year will mark the best year for revenue and earnings-per-share (EPS) growth for computer hardware companies since 1996. Several factors are driving industry growth. First, computer hardware is back in demand following the Y2K corporate spending slowdown, which lasted from the third quarter last year through this spring. Second, corporations need more powerful PCs to run Windows 2000 (Win2K), which launched earlier this year. I expect Win2K will see increasing traction in the market. Third, growth for x86-based servers should continue to accelerate because of the compelling price-performance this offers relative to Unix systems, for example, especially now that Win2K is starting to launch. Fourth, the growing popularity of downloading music and video content from the Internet has many consumers spending more for more powerful PCs with more memory and faster processors that can support streaming media. Although the adoption of Win2K has started off slowly, it should pick up momentum through the rest of the year, especially following the release of the service pack this summer. I believe most corporate IT departments are spending 6 to 9 months evaluating Win2K, prior to their launching the software throughout their companies late this year or early next year. Even though the Win2K software may be launched later, we are seeing corporate buyers buying hardware today that is capable of running Win2K tomorrow. As a result, hardware configurations already are increasing dramatically in both processor speed and memory configurations. Average memory per PC is increasing toward 128MB. Most system administrators recommend at least 128MB of DRAM to support Win2K, with closer to 256MB recommended for optimal price to performance. I believe the average memory per system was about 75MB at the end of 1999. I also see an increasing mix of servers and portable computers driving higher average selling prices, higher margins and greater profitability for the computer hardware companies. Growth in servers, which accounted for 3 percent of 1999 PC units, and portables, which represented 17 percent of units, are exceeding the growth of desktop systems. This should lead to a richer product mix and higher margins and earnings for the computer hardware companies because servers and portables have higher price points and higher margins than desktops. Server growth is ultimately being driven by the build out of the infrastructure that supports the Internet. The attractiveness of the price-performance offering of x86 systems explains why this segment has been growing faster than Unix servers. I believe that x86 growth should continue to accelerate as both Win2K and Linux gain traction. Itanium, Intel's first 64-bit processor architecture, is due out in the fourth quarter and this should also help invigorate server sales. With Win2K and Itanium both available, I see this as the most compelling catalyst for computer system upgrades in the last several years. I believe that 2000 will be the year of the x86 server, much like 1999 was the year of the high-end Unix server and 1998 was the year of the sub-$1000 PC. We are also seeing an interesting dynamic in portables. As the performance of microprocessors for portables is closing the gap with desktop microprocessors, and battery life also is improving, portables are starting to become a no-compromise replacement for desktops in the workplace. As an increasing percentage of the workforce becomes mobile, portables are becoming the computing platform of choice. I believe that this trend will also benefit the computer hardware companies because portables have higher selling prices and higher margins than desktop PCs. Consumer PCs also are being sold for higher profits this year than last. Over 40 percent of all retail PCs being sold today have built-in rewriteable CD drives to take advantage of downloadable music on the Internet. Many PCs are being bought with software for image manipulation to use with digital cameras. Given that the sub-$1,000 PC phenomena started in 1997 and the average PC hardware replacement cycle is three years, many of those buyers are returning to get a more full-featured PC today. All of these factors are combining to make 2000 the best year of revenue and EPS growth for computer hardware companies since 1996, in my view. I believe this sets up a fundamentally different environment than 1999 and I expect to see computer hardware stocks continue to outpace the market.

2001-08-06 - The Intel insider  Paul Otellini once seriously considered becoming a lawyer. Then he reconsidered--a smart decision: After twenty-seven years in the trenches, he?s now one of the highest-ranking executives at Intel. Throughout that long career, the 51-year-old Otellini has played a part in many of the important events shaping the company. His various roles have ranged from managing relations with IBM in the early 1980s to running sales and marketing for the entire company. He oversaw Intel?s push into Ethernet silicon and PC chipsets and also served as technical assistant to former CEO Andy Grove. Since 1998, Otellini has been in charge of the Intel Architecture Group, which means he is responsible for PC, workstation and server processors as well as research and development. And ever since the transfer in power last year that officially elevated Craig Barrett to CEO, Otellini has been frequently mentioned as one of the top candidates to be next in line for the No. 1 job at Intel. But that's--possibly--the future and Otellini has more than enough on this plate in the here and now. The challenges are increasing, what with the drop-off in the economy in the last year and a half as well as Intel's new mobile processors smaller, fasterPaul Otellini, VP, Intel Architecture Group stepped-up competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices. What's more, Otellini has to keep his eye on the payoff from a restructuring of Intel's microprocessor business in the last year as he looks to refashion a more nimble and responsive organization. Otellini, who spends about 40 percent of his time on the road, recently sat down with CNET News.com to talk about the business and what's on tap in the near future as Intel seeks to spur more people to buy systems based on its P4 chip. Q: You're out there in the trenches, so to speak. How does it look in the PC market right now? How does it look for the second half? Our view is that the industry should return to normal growth patterns in the second half. For long-term growth in 2002 to 2007 or 2008, our view is that it returns to the trend line. Historically the first half is bigger than the second half. Would you care to comment on the rivalry with AMD? No.What is it about processors that get people so riled up? The rabidness tends to be a very small segment of the population. The computer industry is 150 million units per year--and the number of tech zealots is under 10 percent. You and I may happen to live in that world, but it's like living in Washington, D.C. You think everyone is into politics.Can you compare 2001 to 1998, when you first stepped into your current job and the semiconductor market also took a downturn? I think it's almost an incomparable year. Depending on how the year sorts out, it's very close to being the first no growth year in the history of the PC. Based upon that, there's really been nothing in the 20 years it's been out that compares to this. I think about that a lot. Is this the beginning of a trend or a reflection of the market we saw in 1999 and 2000? I think it was the latter. Demand was above the trend line. It accelerated in 1999 and 2000. Some of that had to do with the Y2K prepurchases and there was the Internet boom. If you take 1999, 2000 and 2001 together and divide by three you get a much more accurate picture. What made you decide to cut prices on Pentium 4 in April? Was it a specific incident? Or was there a consensus inside Intel that price cuts were needed to get the chip moving? We cut the prices on every product every quarter. The April move was very consistent with that. The more interesting view of that is what we talked about in the (second-quarter earnings) analyst call where we talked about being even more aggressive with Pentium 4 throughout the rest of this year to essentially drive it into the mainstream. So were those price cuts way overblown? I do believe that the moves we made were a significant acceleration versus our prior trends. We are going to push the Pentium 4 to transition from the Pentium IIII, and we're driving the P4 down to mainstream price points from $800 on up. That was driven by three things: the health of the product, overall capacity and the introduction of the 845 chipset ahead of schedule. Does the state of the PC market worry you at all? Analysts say that the majority of PCs are being purchased at prices that range from $800 to $1200 and that there is little activity at prices above $1500. Does this mean that Intel will have to permanently change its processor pricing structure to offer lower priced chips that fit into this band? Or is this a function of the current market? That's what Celeron was all about. When we introduced it, it was to satisfy prices under $1000 and now it?s under $800. I think there's a long-term kind of secular trend here, in terms of the electronics to become increasingly integrated and (manufacturers) to pass on the cost savings. Graphics, I think, is a very good example. Most of our chipsets include integrated graphics now. For the low-end PCs, the very function of integration takes $10 to $20 out of the bill of materials. That's happening in every element of the computer. There's no need to rethink pricing. Our entire business model is set up to displace our old products with our new products. We all heard what you said during Intel's Q2 financial analyst conference call: "We will do what we need to do to transition from the Pentium III to the Pentium 4." What did you mean by that? Our entire business model is predicated on displacing our older product line with newer products. We have been doing this as a company for over 30 years and in the PC arena for 20 years. We will use our design, marketing and manufacturing assets to make the transition from Pentium III to Pentium 4 happen as quickly as possible. With price cuts in effect and the 845 chipset shipping relatively soon, do you feel Pentium 4 is about to come into its own? It's already in major volumes. We said the volumes doubled again this quarter. We'll just continue to grow over the year. The industry now is very much a price point displacement model. If you hit the right price point?people will always take better technology. The new platform (Pentium 4) and a new OS (Windows XP) is incentive for people to upgrade. There's something like 50 million Pentium IIs out there under 500MHz and another 50 million Pentium IIIs at 500MHz. You've got a potential for upgrades that hasn't existed for a number of years. Pentium 4 will hit 2GHz very soon. What do you expect people to do with processors of that speed? What do you think when you hear people say that you don't need that kind or processing power? I have literally had that same question asked of me for the last 25 years. I think that's bunk. Would you be happy with your 286 or your 386 or your Pentium 100? No. The beauty of the industry is that the software grows to consume the MIPS that are available. They demand more MIPS to get similar performance as the previous generation. Ask anyone who's doing advanced work--photography or ripping CDs or home videos--and they'll tell you, 'Give me more MIPS.' I have a 20-year-old son. This is how he spends his time. He's always bugging me for a faster computer.What will the PC look like in five years, aside from faster processors? It will be smaller, faster and wirelessly connected. Always connected--there will be a seamless connection for the devices you use with it (such as PDAs.)What about servers? You must have breathed a sigh of relief when Itanium finally "shipped" How important is Itanium to Intel? Incredibly important. It is our desire to move it into the very highest ends of enterprise computing. You've seen essentially every major computer company in the world, except one, firmly committed to it. As you get that kind of commonality, the software environment tends to follow very rapidly. In this space, it's not just about the microprocessor; it's about the capability of the platform. That is jelling now. I think it gets more interesting next year, when you see second-generation (McKinley) systems, especially coupled with technologies such as Infiniband. It becomes very interesting in terms of the ability to run every aspect of computing in this architecture.How did you arrive at the recent deal with Compaq, which plans to phase out its Alpha chip in favor of Itanium? Suffice it to say that doing proprietary microprocessors is a bloody expensive business. Doing any microprocessor is a bloody expensive business. If you're amortizing that cost over a few units, it's even more prohibitive. Differentiation is not in the processor. Compaq came to the same conclusion that HP did--which is that I can use my engineers to do other stuff because Intel can do (the chips) better and cheaper. Where is Intel going with its mobile processors? My sense is that Intel will begin segmenting that market even more, starting in 2003 with the successor to the Pentium III-M. Will we see a new Pentium brand at that point? It's too soon to predict that. There will be no brand before there is time. I do think the trend is correct in that we're now developing specific products for mobile. Ultimately, the ability to build in seamless connectivity and to have very low power consumption are the vectors that we have the team on today. Realizing that decisions on adopting technology must be made years ahead, we'll just cut to the chase on this one. Was Rambus a mistake? Hindsight is wonderful. The technology is not problematic. The technology is still the best technology out there for showing off the microprocessor. The problem is the cost structure. The cost structure never met the goals we had. I look back and say for the time, I really think it was the right technology. What's the future for the Architecture Group? Some analysts have suggested it would become a cash cow of sorts for Intel, meaning that it will provide steady revenues for the company but grow at a much slower pace than other businesses. Our goal is to grow as quickly as the computing markets we serve will allow and to grow our revenue per computer over time. I absolutely do not view Intel Architecture Group as a cash cow. We are investing to grow our business and capture new revenues. Following up, has Intel's overall Internet building blocks approach been sidetracked by the lousy semiconductor market of late? Any changes to that strategy in the works? There have been no changes to our fundamental strategies. What's next, Paul? Are you Craig Barrett's successor? You'll have to ask Craig and the board. I don't think I'll get a vote. Craig has said very skillfully and elegantly that there are a number of senior managers at Intel that have the potential to move up.
2003-12-03 - The greening of Linux  For Martin Fink, life is good these days. As vice president in charge of Hewlett-Packard's Linux strategy, Fink says HP's decision to indemnify its customers against lawsuits the SCO Group files has been a boon to sales. He also sees HP making inroads with its Linux products against Sun Microsystems' Solaris operating system. Fink has been with HP for 18 years, holding a variety of positions in hardware and software support, consulting and telecom sales. He serves as vice president of the board of directors for the Open Source Development Labs, a global consortium of industry leaders dedicated to enabling Linux. He also wrote the book, "The Business and Economics of Linux and Open Source." CNET News.com recently caught up with Fink amid his extensive travels to talk about the future of Linux and Unix. Q. How much is the SCO suit affecting customers? Is it scaring them away from using Linux? Have you lost any customers as a result? A: The reality is that the Linux market overall is growing. What we were seeing was the market continue to grow at 30 percent to 40 percent. At the same time, we were talking to CIOs who were looking at getting Linux deeper into their enterprise, and they were starting to get concerned about the risk. Even though a number of them might say SCO doesn't have a case, the fact that they can get sued means they can incur a cost. You have to defend yourself. With the HP indemnification, we said, "We'll take accountability for the solution, and we will defend and take over the costs of the defense." That has had a dramatic effect in terms of the moving customers over the fence and forward with Linux. How did the indemnity provision come about? We didn't do this on a whim. There was an extensive amount of due diligence. We took an analysis of the risk profile and said we were willing to accept that risk on behalf of our customers. If you look at what some of the others did, IBM and Red Hat countersued. But from a customer's perspective, that didn't solve the problem. The indemnity solved a real problem today. It had a real customer impact today. IBM has not indemnified, because it considers the suit groundless. Why even dignify SCO's charges by saying you're going to indemnify against this risk? The analyst and customer reaction was positive. The only place I got a couple of negatives was in the open-source community, which had that reaction--that we were dignifying the SCO suit. At the end of the day, when you step into the chief information officer's shoes, he doesn't care if the suit is groundless or if we're dignifying or not dignifying. He cares about, "Will I get sued and incur costs?" What HP is doing is providing protection against those costs. The challenge to IBM: If the suit is groundless, why don't you just indemnify? Have you actually won sales as a result of indemnification? I'll give you one scenario in the financial-services industry. On the day of our announcement, the CIO of a major company was about to issue a purchase order to IBM. The announcement came out, and he said, "We have to go rethink." The purchase order was blocked purely on the basis of our indemnification. Some in the open-source community say the Novell acquisition of SuSE is a sign that the industry is becoming bureaucratized. What's your take? The (Linux) community has to recognize that they can't have it both ways I consider myself part of the open-source community. The (Linux) community has to recognize that it can't have it both ways. Linux cannot be a hobbyist's toy and be the leading operating platform in the industry at the same time. Those two things are incongruent. For Linux to become a credible part of the enterprise, it has to go through the standard evolution and maturing process. We saw some consolidation. It's MBA 101 here--any new market goes through a whole bunch of little players; then there's consolidation. That's what's happening with Linux. I really like the idea that we now have two strong, powerful players that can compete vigorously. How would you characterize Linux sales, in terms of hardware? The vast majority is on Intel x86 servers. We're also seeing sales on Itanium, especially for large supercomputing applications. There's an airport whose approach control system is HP Linux on Itanium. Right now, Linux is definitely the leader on Itanium. HP is not all about Linux. We're about multiple operating systems. Our analysis shows that 85 percent of enterprises have multiple operating systems. The idea of saying, "The world is about Linux" is not the real world. The real world is, "You've got to have a strong Linux solution, but you've also got to have Windows and Unix." Our Systems Insight Manager (formerly Nimbus) is a platform that looks across the whole thing. HP has a close relationship with Microsoft. How does pushing Linux affect that relationship? Our strategy is a multi-operating system strategy. IBM is pushing Linux at the expense of other things. We're pushing Linux as part of a complete enterprise solution. Does Microsoft want HP to be selling Linux stuff? No. But at the same time, they understand that Linux is in the market, and we have to compete. It's not about competing with Microsoft. HP is not poking a finger in their eye. It's about competing with Dell and IBM. What are you seeing with Linux on the desktop? Linux on the desktop is definitely an area where hype is ahead of reality by orders of magnitude. There's a sexiness around the idea of taking on Microsoft. The reality is that (desktop Linux) is still less than 2 percent of the market, but at the same time, we certify and sell a number of Linux desktop solutions. There are two areas of interest: the engineering desktop with folks like DreamWorks and Disney, and the application developer. We are certifying our notebooks with Linux, and the target there is big-time application developers. In the developing countries that don't have the Windows legacy--like India, China, Asia Pacific and the Eastern bloc--we see some pretty significant volume there. What about Sun's announcement at Comdex about its agreement to sell Linux desktops to China? I'm in the process of doing a reality check. I was personally in China a couple of months ago. I signed a deal with Red Flag Software, which has 90 percent of the Linux desktops in China. (With Sun's announcement), I'm really confused--is everybody buying two? It didn't add up for me. If I've got the relationship with Red Flag, I have no answer for how Sun could possibly be doing that much business. It seems like people have already acclimated to two platforms. That's an unknown. We have to wait and see how it plays out. That (Linux) desktop is not mature. You take the Windows desktop, and it's more sophisticated, more developed. We've now got Red Hat saying, "If you're doing a desktop, stick to Windows." Customers say they have to set up a new competency center and support two operating systems. When you think about it, customers have done that for a long time--on the server side. I'm not sure what they'll do on the desktop. Are you steering customers from HP-UX to Linux? If they're more business application-oriented, the path is HP-UX. Four to five years from now, from a server perspective, Unix is $20 billion, Windows is $20 billion and Linux is $9 billion. That's why we don't do "It's all about Linux." That's not reality. From a migration perspective, we have some 64-bit customers who have moved to Linux. Those who are running huge SAP systems are still HP-UX. Do you see a time when Unix will disappear? Any planning beyond three years is way out there. In the three-year time frame, which is what we call the foreseeable future, Unix is flat. It's not a growth business. A lot of the growth is going to Linux, but the Unix business is not going away. There are players in the Unix market smack in the sights of Linux. Solaris is the Unix going away. Why is Sun the big Linux victim? I think we have a personality issue with Mr. McNealy. When Linux started, it was mostly on the Web server applications. That was the market where Sun exploded. Sun's business is all skewed into the low-end business. HP and IBM are skewed mid to high. Linux came in at the low end. The cost value proposition and the low switching cost meant it was a dead-center nuclear explosion, where Sun's business was. Everyplace Linux is strong is where Sun historically has been strong and HP has been weak. For us, this is a completely incremental play. It's a beautiful thing. Put on the hat of your counterpart at Sun, and tell me what you would do. That's a hard question. They have a fundamentally broken business model. Sun is trying to play its cards in too many places. They're defocused. They're making irrational, emotional decisions. With the desktop, that's an emotional thing--trying to take on Bill Gates and stick it in his eye. It is not grounded on any business reality. If you're Dell, and your business is growing, and you want to grow into new areas like consumer electronics, that makes sense. If your business is tanking, and you're on your way down, you should be focusing on your core business and getting your cost envelope to something you can afford, and then say, "How do I grow from here?" Sun believes it has the most complete Linux strategy of any of the top vendors I think Sun has to paint an end-of-life picture for Sparc. People are internalizing some of their press releases around (Advanced Micro Devices') Opteron as that being the alternative. Having done the migration from (HP's chip) PA-RISC to Itanium, we've been doing that for eight years. You can't just flip a switch and say, "Yesterday it was Sparc, today it's Opteron." It doesn't work like that. You need to get your ISV (independent software vendor) partners there; you need to get your virtualization story straight. The other challenge is that Solaris on Opteron and Solaris on Sparc are two completely different operating systems. You can't just take all your Solaris Sparc stuff and move it to Opteron. Does (Sun CEO Scott) McNealy rub people the wrong way? I think we have a personality issue with Mr. McNealy. He's being a little too arrogant and cocky for the position he's in. A few spoonfuls of humble pie might be appropriate. But that's the board of directors' job.
2003-05-19 - The fear war against Linux Microsoft's connection to the anti-Linux campaign being waged by the SCO Group is becoming clear. In the latest move, Microsoft has stepped up the battle with an announced agreement to license SCO's Unix patents and the source code, describing the deal as a reflection of its "ongoing commitment to respecting intellectual property and the IT community's healthy exchange of IP through licensing." Nice rhetoric. This comes after SCO just last week sent a letter to big IT customers, threatening legal action. And the reality is that Microsoft is tying SCO's allegations into its own anti-GPL campaign, a mostly unsuccessful effort to convince customers that the sharing and openness methods used in Linux development are unhealthy for the market. (SCO has gone so far as to publish "Quotations from Linux Leaders," a collection of inaccurate and out-of-context quotes of GNU Public License creator Richard Stallman and myself to paint Linux developers as nothing better than software pirates.) Someone should tell SCO that IT customers don't like to be threatened by their vendors. In fact, the increasingly bellicose tone of SCO's communications and the refusal to show any evidence might well suggest that its claims are nothing more than grandiose ravings. To be sure, Microsoft will take advantage of those ravings while it can. The real story here is the lack of substance to the SCO claims, and the increasingly remote chance that its lawyers will prevail. A similar case alleging plagiarism of Unix by an open-source operating system was litigated in the early '90s. AT&T sued the University of California, claiming that the BSD system infringed upon AT&T's copyrights. Eventually, the court narrowed AT&T's concerns down to only four source files, which the university simply replaced rather than argue about them. AT&T then settled the case by paying the university's court costs. SCO is not likely to do any better. SCO's lawsuit against IBM is not a patent case. The fundamental patents on Unix would have expired long ago, while SCO's handful of patents aren't significant. The main allegation is that trade secrets of Unix have been copied into Linux. To win a trade secret case, you have to prove the information was secret. Detailed knowledge of Unix has been available in libraries for 30 years, and a full Unix specification was distributed by the U.S. government as part of its POSIX standards. The Unix source code has been licensed to universities for the past 30 years, and most good college computer science departments made use of a copy until the publicly available Linux came along. While students were contractually restricted from committing plagiarism by directly copying code, they also were expected to use what they'd learned from the Unix internals during their entire careers. And computer science textbooks have documented every aspect of operating system internals for a long time. It is thus extremely unlikely that SCO can show that any of the claimed "trade secrets" were secret at all. Someone should tell SCO that IT customers don't like to be threatened by their vendors. Besides the older Unix secrets, SCO claims that IBM copied newly developed SCO trade secrets that got revealed through the two companies' partnership during the Monterey project. The use of secrets is now alleged to have enabled Linux to run efficiently on the Intel Itanium processor. In fact, the lead engineers on the Linux Itanium port weren't even at IBM; they are Hewlett-Packard's David Mosberger and Stephane Eranian. Their book, "IA-64 Linux Kernel," documents the work they performed. Itanium was derived from HP's PA-RISC architecture through an HP-Intel partnership, and thus it's much more likely that any Itanium rocket science in the Linux kernel has come from HP and Intel, rather than IBM and SCO. There's also a problem with attributing too much interest in Itanium to IBM, which makes its own CPU chips in competition with Intel. And the very notion of IBM being the Robin Hood of operating systems--stealing from SCO to give to Linux--is difficult to believe. Of the companies that could be expected to have stringent policies and training about intellectual-property issues, IBM must head the list. Similarly, the open-source community has been careful to create its own code rather than copy others. Richard Stallman's 1984 "GNU Manifesto" deals extensively with copyright issues and ownership of software, and later documents, like my "Open Source Definition," have continued that process. Our developers are smart enough to understand the consequences of plagiarism. Where SCO stands And yet SCO officers allege--without any substantiating evidence--that their copyrighted code has been appropriated into Linux. If there's been any copying, it's much more likely that the publicly available GNU/Linux code has been copied into the secret SCO source. To prove otherwise, SCO would have to present evidence regarding the date its code was written. The creation dates for Linux code aren't in question because CD-ROM archives exist of all stages of its development and have been sold to thousands of witnesses. SCO's allegations can't be proven until its lawyers produce the evidence. But no publicly disclosed evidence is forthcoming until the trial, says SCO's Darl McBride, because it would give Linux developers a chance to launder their issues. As if they could wipe the bits off of the hundreds of thousands of Linux source-code CDs already sold. SCO says it might show the evidence to "independent experts" under a nondisclosure agreement in a few weeks. But why is an NDA necessary? By SCO's own attestation, the code in question is already available to the public. The company would not be further damaged by a public display of evidence. The no-spin answer is that by delaying the public release of evidence, SCO can continue to make unsubstantiated assertions about Linux for as long as possible. It's interesting to look at the size of the Linux development organization. Some 440 people are listed in the Linux kernel credits--that's only a partial list. They produce 50,000-plus lines of new or modified code per month. And that's just the kernel--other sizable teams produce libraries, utilities and applications. SCO, a small and troubled company, can't hope to match those figures. Indeed, any Unix team in history would have been hard-pressed to rival them. Why, then, would Linux or IBM need SCO's contribution? And what of SCO's own participation in Linux, and its effect upon its lawsuit and future income? SCO shut down distribution of its own Linux system, citing "intellectual property risk." So what? The company's behavior had already driven Linux customers elsewhere. And shutting down its Linux business does not change SCO's intellectual-property risk: The company had already distributed the Linux kernel and other critical components under the GPL license as part of SCO's own products. Who really benefits from this mess? Microsoft. SCO had more than adequate chance to notice if it owned any of the code in question. The GPL does not have a termination date and promises royalty-free use of the licensed code to everyone. The fact is, SCO's potential to collect royalties from the Linux kernel or anything else connected with the GPL is nil. For SCO to have been distributing the very code it contends was appropriated--under a license that assures everyone of the right to use it for free--further hurts its chances of prevailing. SCO management also fails to grasp its liability for the harm it is causing to countless customers, developers and software projects involved in Linux. The group's actions will lead to loss of sales and jobs, delayed projects, canceled financing, and the like. The damage to others will certainly invite retribution when the frivolity of SCO's claims is revealed. I earlier thought the suit could be a bid to force IBM to acquire SCO at a cheaper price than the cool billion dollars being demanded to settle the case. Big Blue, which isn't taking the bait, must be confident of winning. Who really benefits from this mess? Microsoft, whose involvement in getting a defeated Unix company to take on the missionary work of spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) about Linux is finally coming to light. Microsoft hardly needs an SCO source license. Its license payment to SCO is simply a good-looking way to pass along a bribe, coupled with an announcement designed to further intimidate Linux users. It's hard to imagine former Microsoft adversaries SCO and David Boies doing Bill Gates' bidding, but Microsoft's money is green. SCO stockholders should be asking questions.
2001-04-12 - THE DAY AHEAD VA Linux delivers diversifies revenue base   First-day IPO hype aside, VA Linux (Nasdaq: LNUX) is delivering on exactly what it said it would do -- boost margins, post eye-popping revenue growth and diversify its revenue base. Once a company sets an IPO record and hits a high of 320 shortly after going public, its biggest enemy becomes the market's hype machine. Of course, VA Linux didn't create 1999's hype, but it's still hard to overcome. VA Linux, which offers open source Linux systems and services, was put in a position where it could never live up to its IPO splash. To its credit, VA Linux has shown it can execute even as shares trade light years away from their 52-week highs. The proof is in the earnings reports. VA Linux topped Wall Street estimates by a nickel in its fourth quarter with earnings of $4 million, or 10 cents a share, on record sales of $50.7 million. The results exclude charges. More importantly, gross margins jumped to 22 percent and sales surged 46 percent sequentially. Prakesh Patel, an analyst with W.R. Hambrecht, projected sales of $42.7 million and gross margins topping 20 percent. Patel reiterated his "buy" rating earlier in the week. The other notable point about VA Linux, primarily a hardware vendor, is its sales diversification efforts. In the fourth quarter, VA Linux's system revenue represented 92 percent of sales with the remainder being split between services and Web initiatives related to the Andover.net acquisition. The Andover acquisition was effective just for half the fourth quarter. CFO Todd Schull said on a conference call that the company expects 2001 system revenue to represent 75 percent of sales with 15 percent derived from services. The remainder will be Web related. As for fiscal 2001 sales, Schull said revenue will be 2.5 to 2.7 times 2000 sales of $120.3 million. Long-term gross margins should be in the 27 percent range with profits by the end of calendar 2001, said Schull. Battling the big vendorsMuch of the VA Linux conference call was spent talking about the competitive landscape. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP), Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) all have targeted the Linux server market. CEO Larry Augustin said the company, which primarily sold rack-mountable servers in the quarter, had a good win rate in the market and wasn't going head-to-head with the IBMs of the world. Augustin said he "wouldn't be surprised" if VA Linux was winning two-thirds of the accounts it targeted. However, that situation could change. VA Linux primarily targets service providers. Akamai (Nasdaq: AKAM) represented 21 percent of fourth quarter sales, with HP and Exodus (Nasdaq: EXDS) as other large customers. Dell, HP and IBM are focused more on corporate customers. In the near future, VA Linux is likely to go head-to-head with big vendors as it ports Linux to Intel's 64-bit Itanium chip and targets higher-end systems. Augustin also noted that there's a lot of interest in Linux from financial services companies. "We hear a lot of noise in the market, but there's a big difference in knowing it," said Augustin, referring to the open source movement. VA Linux contends it can deliver a full suite of open-source products and build-to-order capabilities -- something the big vendors can't match. The futureAlthough VA Linux and the big hardware/services vendors will happily co-exist for a few years because of the "tremendous market opportunity" in open source software, there will come a day where VA Linux will bump heads with the big vendors. By this time, Linux will be a critical component of the big vendors' growth plans. Given that equation, it's really hard to see VA Linux remaining as an independent company down the line. HP, IBM and Dell could all be acquirers of VA Linux -- assuming it keeps on executing. Another wild card would be Compaq (NYSE: CPQ), which needs the server help. Nothing is imminent, but it's something to ponder. TDAIN VA Linux tops estimates on record revenue Subscribe to The Day Ahead >
2000-10-13 - THE DAY AHEAD Scenes from Intel's e-business lovefest  COMMENTARY -- If you listened to Intel execs pitch at its eXCHANGE e-business summit this week, you'd think officials were abducted by solution-happy e-business aliens, who were hell-bent on ushering the "new, new computer industry." Here are a few snippets from the event. Intel's reachOne thing that became increasingly clear during Intel's e-business solution fest is the chip maker's reach via investments. About half of the exhibitors in Intel's e-business showcase have received funding from the chip giant. Some of these companies have had some eye-popping IPOs, which goes a long way toward explaining Intel's big investment gains. So why is Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) so big on e-business? It's about selling Intel's high-end chips, most of which aren't shipping. During each keynote, references were made to Intel's Itanium chip line, which promises to change the world -- when it actually ships. Intel touted the coming of the "new, new computer industry" that will reach $8 trillion by 2020. In Intel's world, computing power is at the center of the e-business revolution. In this new world, Intel CEO Craig Barrett says "solutions" at least once a minute and the chip giant's fingerprints are everywhere. Back to those Intel commercialsFor Selectica (Nasdaq: SLTC), an Intel investment enabled the company to optimize its Internet selling software to run better on all platforms. Intel's cash was nice too. For Ariba (Nasdaq: ARBA), Intel's Itanium chips will mean the company can expand its B2B software to more customers. Ariba, which can run its software on any platform, began by focusing on Fortune 100 companies, which meant optimizing for Unix. Ariba wasn't alone in its praise of Intel's Itanium, due in the first half of 2001. The company's booth was perched next door to competitors Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) and Commerce One (Nasdaq: CMRC), as well as partner I2 Technologies (Nasdaq: ITWO). Most of these B2B players went after the big customers first. That's changing as customers down the food chain plan Windows 2000 and Itanium transitions. "Itanium will really help our adoption rates," said one Ariba booth jockey. Even Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) CEO Carly Fiorina couldn't refrain from the Intel commercials. She said Itanium is the biggest technical shift facing information technology. Fiorina put Itanium ahead of open source technology such as Linux and the move toward service-based computing. Itanium may be the real deal, but I wouldn't rank it that high. That pesky stock priceIntel could talk solutions, e-business and the new era in computing, but it couldn't escape its falling stock price. Shares have been hammered since Intel's third quarter profit warning. Meanwhile, rival AMD (NYSE: AMD) delivered great results. During Barrett's keynote, CyberCorp CEO Philip Berber illustrated how his company's software was running its trading software on Intel's latest chips. Barrett said he was "almost afraid to ask" about the stock price and to no one's surprise it was down. Berber noted that he thought Intel was a screaming buy and asked Barrett for advice. "I think the SEC would put me in jail if I said anything," quipped Barrett, referring to Intel's quiet period ahead of its earnings. Barrett later said Wall Street was overreacting about Intel's profit warning. Nevertheless, Berber bought shares with "live money in my account." Of course, the Itanium pitch wasn't forgotten. The spikes in volatility and trading volume would naturally need Intel next-generation processors to keep up. Shhhh.Optimism abounded at Intel's e-business shindig, but there weren't many details to back up the bullish outlook. Blame the quiet period. With most companies reporting earnings in the next two weeks, most officials were relegated to terms such as "business is looking good" and "we're comfortable with expectations." Selectica CEO Rajen Jaswa knew the drill. He couldn't say much about his company's financial results, which will be reported Oct. 17, but hit some key points. "Once Y2K ended, all the IT spending went to e-business," he said. "Ninety-nine percent of our customers are brick-and-mortar and they're all investing in this for basic business functions. E-business applies to everybody. We're comfortable with our business." Symbolism?Intel also provided a little entertainment with Huey Lewis and the News performing at a local club Wednesday night. Compaq sponsored the event. Nothing against Huey, but I had to wonder about the symbolism behind the choice, especially given the "new, new computer industry" chatter. Huey Lewis saw his heyday in the late s and early s. And some would say that was the high mark for the PC industry.

2000-07-20 - THE DAY AHEAD AMD 'reasonably uncrushable' vs Intel    This just in: Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD) has proclaimed itself "reasonably uncrushable" when it comes to battling its larger nemesis Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC). We'd take it a step farther and say AMD has graduated from being a chimp to a gorilla. Now there are two 800-pound gorillas in the chip market. Luckily for us, the gorilla warfare is entertaining. AMD checked in with its latest quarterly results Wednesday and threw in a stock split for good measure. The company reported second quarter net income of $207.1 million, or $1.21 per share. First Call's survey of 18 analysts predicted an AMD profit of $1.14 per share for the quarter ended July 2. A higher tax rate also masked what could have been even higher earnings. Sales were up 7 percent sequentially to $1.17 billion. Exactly a year ago, AMD was losing tons of cash. The results, coupled with strong demand that only "an act of God" could derail, had AMD officials giddy. And why not? AMD has been running circles around Intel, which has had numerous problems and took a $200 million charge to replace defective motherboards in its second quarter. In the chip race, AMD is giving Intel a great run with strong products. In addition, AMD's quarter was refreshing because it was clean and easy to understand. Translation: No major investment gains to puff up results. Intel's quarter was messy to say the least. The company had a $2.1 billion investment gain in its second quarter. Back that gain out and Intel doesn't look so hot. In fact, operating earnings were flat. Of course, Intel gets a free pass on Wall Street. Of 33 analysts only three are cautious on the stock. No matter how many glitches, odd financial items or body blows Intel takes from AMD, analysts are usually cheery despite the challenges. "We believe that Intel will likely outperform in the second half," said Scott Randall, an analyst at Wit SoundView, who reiterated a "strong buy" rating Wednesday. But even the biggest cheerleaders have a few concerns. Ashok Kumar, of USB Piper Jaffray, said Intel "left some money on the table" by underestimating demand in recent quarters. Meanwhile, AMD keeps making a lot of noise. On a conference call with analysts, Hector J. Ruiz, president and chief operating officer for AMD, struggled to be negative. "I have to think hard to say something negative," he said. The processor market also looks robust, executives said. Shipments of 1GHz Athlon chips quintupled during the quarter, said Ruiz. "We were able to meet our commitments to all our customers in this high-end segment," Ruiz said, contrasting Athlon's availability with the shortage of Intel's 1GHz Pentium III chips. As for the flash memory market, there's no slowdown in sight. AMD said it is already sold out through the year. Some analysts have said flash memory, which powers wireless devices, was headed for a slowdown. On its core Athlon and Duron processors, AMD was also bullish. The company said shipments will increase to 3.6 million units in the third quarter and to 7.2 million units in the fourth quarter. The growth should provide higher average selling prices. The chip market is fragile and has a history of boom and bust cycles, but for now AMD is booming. Big Blue sees blue skies in second halfAfter three quarters devoid of revenue growth, investors were hoping for any kind of optimism coming from IBM's (NYSE: IBM) second quarter conference call. Big Blue delivered. As far as the second quarter results go, IBM had a ho-hum quarter. The company topped estimates with earnings of $1.06 a share, but sales fell 1 percent year-over-year to $21.7 billion. The outlook, however, was the real focus. The company remains comfortable with analysts' full year earnings estimates, CFO John Joyce said, during a conference call with analysts. First Call currently predicts a profit of $4.36 per share for 2000. Joyce also said he "felt good about our momentum." Joyce said mainframe shipments were perking up (1 percent growth in the second quarter after previous declines), and added the second half looked strong. Joyce even went out on a limb and said the company could hit double-digit revenue growth in the second half. Analysts estimate that IBM will post mid-single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth in the second half. IBM even said its PC division may post a profit by the end of the year. Now that's optimistic.

2005-06-08 - The brains behind Apple's Rosetta Transitive   A Silicon Valley start-up called Transitive is supplying Apple Computer with a crucial bridge to enable the move to Intel-based computers, but skeptics worry about performance problems that have plagued similar products. Transitive is providing the engine used in Apple's Rosetta software, which translates software for its current machines using PowerPC processors so it can run on forthcoming Intel-based Macintoshes. "We've had a long-term relationship with them," Transitive Chief Executive Bob Wiederhold said Tuesday. As a program runs, Rosetta translates its PowerPC instructions into corresponding x86 instructions. Although there are limits to what programs it can translate, the software promises to ease the transition that current Apple customers and software developers face. Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs on Monday demonstrated Rosetta during a keynote address, showing it running PowerPC versions of Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Word and Excel--three applications essential to the success of the Macintosh line. News.context What's new: A Silicon Valley start-up called Transitive is supplying Apple Computer with a crucial bridge to enable the move to Intel-based computers.Bottom line: Apple and Transitive face performance challenges. Success has been elusive for computer makers trying to support one chip's software on a machine with a different chip. More stories on Apple's move to Intel Jobs' Rosetta demonstration went smoothly--he loaded and edited several documents--but both Apple and Transitive face performance challenges with Rosetta. Success has been elusive for computer makers trying to support one chip's software on a machine with a different chip. "History says that binary translation basically doesn't work," said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. "The day may come when someone can do a good enough job with it, but that concept has been thrown out there many times in the computer industry, and it's always fallen flat on its face." But Los Gatos, Calif.-based Transitive is willing to set high expectations when comparing software compiled natively for the new processor to that compiled for the older processor and running on the new one. In the case of Transitive's first customer, Silicon Graphics Inc., software for the older processor generally reaches at least 80 percent of the speed of native software, Wiederhold said. But that high score stems partly from the fact that the SGI systems are used for graphics tasks, which have little or no translation penalty, he said. With more computationally intense tasks, the performance of translated software is between 60 percent and 80 percent of native software, Wiederhold said. Another skeptic is Nathan Brookwood of Insight 64. "Everybody always has said 50 (percent) or 60 percent and delivered 30 (percent) or 40 percent," he said. Among those who have tried: Digital Equipment Corp.'s FX!32 to run x86 Windows programs on computers with Alpha chips; Hewlett-Packard's Aries software to run HP-UX software for PA- RISC chips on Itanium; and Intel's IA32-EL software to run software for x86 chips on Itanium. Jobs was satisfied, though. During his demonstration, Jobs said translated software runs "pretty fast," though his presentation's slide said performance is "good (enough)." His demonstration computer had a 3.6GHz Pentium 4 and 2GB of memory. Apple, though not known for bending over backward to support users of older Macs, has some experience helping users with processor transitions. When it changed from Motorola 680x0 processors to PowerPC in 1994, it included emulation software that would let users run the older software on the newer machines. "Like many start-up companies with breakthrough technology, there's a lot of skepticism about the technology itself." --Bob WiederholdCEO, Transitive And Wiederhold is delighted to have Apple as a customer. "Like many start-up companies with breakthrough technology, there's a lot of skepticism about the technology itself--whether we can meet the claims we discuss," he said. "Getting proof points out there is very important to our success." One thing that's unclear is whether Rosetta will work in the other direction--translating x86 software for use on PowerPC Macs, something that could significantly expand Transitive's revenue sources. That feature, by ensuring future Mac software will work on older-generation machines, could help convince potential PowerPC-based Mac customers not to put off their purchases. Transitive last fall released a version of QuickTransit that would support such a feature, but Wiederhold wouldn't comment on whether Apple plans to use it. However, Apple hopes programmers will create what it calls "universal binaries"--software that includes versions for both processors in one package. Doing so would significantly increase the size of a program, but if programmers followed this practice, an Intel-to-PowerPC translator wouldn't be needed. Apple has been reluctant to discuss where Transitive fits into the Rosetta technology, though Jobs did confirm in a New York Times interview that Transitive is playing a role. In an interview with CNET News.com, Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller declined to say how much of Rosetta was developed in-house. "I'm not going to talk about details, but it's Apple technology," Schiller said. "I'm not going to talk about details, but it's Apple technology." --Apple's Phil Schiller on how much of Rosetta was developed in-house Transitive has about 65 employees, with all engineering staff in Manchester, England. Founder and Chief Technology Officer Alasdair Rawsthorne developed the technology in 1995 at the University of Manchester and built a company around it in 2000. The company has raised $24 million in three rounds of investment--in October 2000, in February 2002 and in September 2004, Wiederhold said. Investors are Pond Venture Partners, Crescendo Ventures and Accel Partners. Six major computer makers are Transitive customers, and some new ones should be announced in coming months, Wiederhold said. Later this year or early next, the company wants to start selling products to a second class of customer: software companies that can include QuickTransit as a quick way to bring products to new processors. QuickTransit can be used to bring software to Itanium, PowerPC, and x86 from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. It can translate software from computers with x86, mainframe, Power or MIPS chips. AltiVec and other limitations While Rosetta will work to translate many Mac programs, it does have some important limitations. "Many, but not all, applications can run translated," Apple said in a paper for developers. "Applications that run translated will never run as fast as they run as a native binary because the translation process itself incurs a processing cost." Apple said that Rosetta is "designed to translate currently shipping applications that run on a PowerPC with a G3 processor and that are built for Mac OS X." However, Apple said Rosetta can't run several types of code: that written specifically to use the PowerPC's AltiVec instructions; that which requires a G4 or G5 chip; programs written for Mac OS 9, which today can run with Mac OS X's "classic" environment; kernel extensions; applications that depend on kernel extensions; and code that inserts preferences in the System Preferences pane. "How compatible your application is with Rosetta depends on the type of application it is," Apple said. "Applications that have a lot of user interaction and low computational needs, such as a word processor, are quite compatible. Those that have a moderate amount of user interaction and some high computational needs or that use OpenGL are, in most cases, also quite compatible. Those that have intense computing needs aren't compatible." Apple said that there are no visual indications that an application is being translated. A dialog box in the Finder can be used, though, to see whether an application exists only in a PowerPC binary.
2002-11-25 - TeraGrid supercomputing project expands    A project to build and interconnect mammoth supercomputers has landed a $35 million National Science Foundation grant that will take the "grid" beyond its original Itanium 2 designs. In 2001, an alliance of academic supercomputing sites won a $53 million NSF grant to build the Distributed Terascale Facility, known for short as the TeraGrid. Now a $35 million supplement this year will expand the TeraGrid in a project formally known as the Extensible Terascale Facility. The expansion will connect different varieties of supercomputers at five different sites, with an eye to adding more later. Last year's design called for four computers with a total of 3,300 Itanium 2 processors, code-named McKinley, from Intel in servers built by IBM and installed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), the California Institute of Technology and Argonne National Laboratory. That plan has now changed: Many of the supercomputers in the TeraGrid will instead use a later version of Itanium 2 code-named Madison due in 2003. And with the new $35 million funding this year, other varieties of computer are being added to the mix--the "extensible" part of the TeraGrid project. Among them are one existing Hewlett-Packard machine with more than 2,700 Alpha processors and one new HP server using next-generation Alpha processors at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. "We're building the plans for the TeraGrid in such a way that we anticipate being able to add additional sites in future years," said Rob Pennington, who leads NCSA's grid work. "This is not intended to be a closed system. It's intended so additional sites with sufficient compute, storage and network bandwidth will be able to join." One candidate for future admission is a new cluster of 12 IBM p690 servers at NCSA that collectively will be able to perform one trillion calculations per second. IBM announced that system earlier this month. At Pittsburgh, the new HP system will use its own next-generation EV7 Alpha processors, code-named Marvel, said Rick Maier, the HP program manager who oversees the company's role in the Pittsburgh work. The new system will be fully installed in April, he said, and will be joined by another cluster of HP Itanium 2 systems running the Linux operating system. The TeraGrid is one of the most ambitious efforts to develop "grid" computing, an emerging technology to join computers into a single vast pool of processing power and storage capacity. Grid computing is being spawned by the same government-funded academic forces that built the Internet. Large computing companies--including IBM, HP and Sun Microsystems--are getting involved in grids, while a host of smaller software companies are sprouting up with software to govern how jobs run across grids. Among them are Avaki, Platform Computing, UnitedDevices, Axceleon and Entropia. One key part of grid work is an open-source project called the Globus Toolkit, which helps with tasks such as discovering what processing resources are available on a grid and deciding what jobs have permission to use them. In total, the TeraGrid computers will be able to perform 20 trillion calculations per second, a performance called 20 teraflops. But while part of the point of the project is to figure out how best to share single computing jobs and data storage across different elements of the grid, most computing jobs probably won't span the entire collection. "Using the entire set of computational clusters will be the application team's goal, but that's probably not going to be the primary way people are going to use it," Pennington said. At the SC2002 supercomputing show last week, TeraGrid representatives demonstrated several aspects of the system, including 32 dual-processor Itanium 2 servers from IBM. Other demonstrations used the system for climate change modeling, high-speed access to data stored at remote sites, and creation of animations of three-dimensional data such as molecular structures. The TeraGrid also uses network capacity from Qwest Communications, storage networking switches from Brocade Communications and networking routers from Juniper Networks. The current fastest single supercomputer in the world is NEC's Earth Simulator in Tokyo, with performance of 36 teraflops; IBM has just won a $290 million contract to build a 100-teraflop machine and a 360-teraflop machine.
2001-06-25 - Techs inch up despite bleak outlook    Investors placed cautious bets ahead of this week's Federal Reserve meeting, inching stocks up Monday despite dour forecasts for the technology sector.The Nasdaq composite index grew 16.03 points to 2,050.87, and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 100.37 points to 10,504.22. Though the Street believes the Fed will slash interest rates for the sixth time since January when it meets this Tuesday and Wednesday, investors are debating whether it will be a quarter- or a half-percentage-point cut. Even if the Fed does cut rates, it might not be enough to inspire big gains. "What the market wants is tangible proof that the liquidity the Fed has pumped into the economy is starting to be reflected in earnings reports," S&P Marketscope analyst Paul Cherney said. Monday's small serving of economic news isn't expected to sway the decision, though it indicates surprising strength in the economy. Existing home sales rose 2.9 percent to an annual rate of about 5.37 million in May, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors. That compares with a rate of 5.2 million in April and predictions the rate would stay even at 5.2 million. The tech sector and a couple of its industries reported news that was more bleak. Investor confidence dropped to a four-year low in June, according to the Index of Investor Optimism, a monthly survey conducted by UBS PaineWebber and the Gallup Organization. A separate study released by J.P. Morgan Chase Monday predicted that the Standard & Poor's 500 would close out the first half of the year around 1,229--the level where it finished 1998.Investment banks also gave negative forecasts for the PC and semiconductor equipment industries. Merrill Lynch said a recovery in orders for the semiconductor-equipment industry could be pushed out to the first half of 2002, and J.P. Morgan Chase trimmed estimates for the PC market. But shares were up in both sectors, and CNET's Semiconductor Capital Equipment Index was up 0.76 percent, and CNET's PC Hardware Index rose 0.99 percent. The only sector showing dramatic gains Monday was storage. CNET's Storage Index was up 4.19 percent, led by EMC, up $1.94, or 7 percent, to $28.35. In company news, Sierra Wireless cut its second- and third-quarter forecasts and analysts downgraded the shares. The stock became the Nasdaq's biggest loser, down $5.40, or 28 percent, to $14.00. Compaq Computer rose 40 cents to $13.90 after announcing a restructuring plan that will give a boost to Intel and help the PC maker combat slowing sales by focusing on software and services. The news is a major boost to Intel's Itanium chip because Compaq will license its Alpha chip technology to Intel and use Itanium in its servers as it looks to consolidate its operations to focus on software and computer services. Intel shares were up $1.07 to $28.58. Yahoo rose $2.42 to $19.73 on upbeat forecasts for advertising. Amazon.com was up 41 cents to $12.81, and AOL Time Warner dropped 10 cents to $53.00. Among other technology bellwethers, Microsoft rose 2 cents to $68.85, Oracle gained 29 cents to $17.77, and Cisco Systems jumped 99 cents to $18.51. Staff and Reuters contributed to this report.
2001-06-04 - Tech titans tout new Java tools    Oracle, Sun Microsystems, BEA Systems and others will add a boost of caffeine to their Java menus this week. Software makers are courting the Java faithful at the JavaOne trade show with new products that allow software developers to use the Java programming language to build their business software. For years, the software companies have hitched their future to Java to combat rival Microsoft. They're all gunning for a piece of the lucrative market for e-business software that enables companies to share data and conduct trades online. They're also racing to offer the technology that businesses need to build Web-based software and services. The software makers this week will announce new Java products to improve and fill holes in their product portfolio, said Gartner analyst Mark Driver. "Everyone is coming out to push out their latest and greatest." Oracle on Monday announced it has jazzed up its application server with improved Java support to better compete against market-share leaders BEA and IBM, which have captured 35 percent and 30 percent of the $1.6 billion market, respectively. Application-server software allows businesses to handle e-commerce and other Web site transactions. Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison recently blamed his company's poor showing in the application-server market on its poor support of Java. Oracle executives now say the company's product is finally up to snuff. Oracle has rebuilt its application server to make Java software run faster than it previously could, said John Magee, senior director of Oracle 9i marketing. "Oracle has not been known for its core Java support. Now we have made major enhancements to make (the server) faster and smaller." The database-software giant, like its rivals, is supporting the new version of a Java-based standard for writing business software. The standard, called Java 2 Enterprise Edition, is a uniform way for companies to build business software using the Java language. At its core is the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) programming model, which lets developers create reusable pieces of software code and is a direct competitor to Microsoft's programming model. Not to be outdone, BEA on Monday is releasing several new products, including a version of its application server that supports new Web standards that allow people to build Web-based software and services. Oracle's new application server supports the new Web standards as well. All the software companies have been racing to develop and sell software for building and delivering Web services, which let people access software through the Web instead of from individual PCs. To fill gaps in its e-business product family, BEA also announced a new integration server, software that allows businesses to link their different computing systems so they can exchange data and conduct business over the Web. The company also announced new portal software, which allows businesses to create Web portal sites for their employees, partners and suppliers. IBM, which last week announced similar application-server features to be released later this summer, said that its WebSphere application server will support a new Java standard that will make it simpler for telecommunications service providers to offer new, fancy features to telephone subscribers. Hewlett-Packard will announce a small, lightweight version of its application server, so software developers who are writing business software can integrate an application server into their product. Sun executives say the company will release a high-end Java software development tool to better compete against WebGain, Borland and IBM, which have traditionally led the market in Java tools for writing software. Sun's Forte for Java Enterprise Edition supports EJBs and includes features that allow members of a software-development team to work closely together on the same project. Sun needed to release the high-end tool to help augment sales of its iPlanet family of application servers and other e-business software, analysts say. "Their previous Forte for Java tools were entry level at best. It was a hobbyist tool and not used by the bulk of commercial developers," said Gartner's Driver. iPlanet, an alliance between Sun and America Online, on Monday is releasing new messaging software that allows business messages to be sent back and forth from company to company. Borland is announcing that software giant SAP has chosen its product for developing Java. Borland also recently announced that it has built a new Java development tool for Nokia, allowing software programmers to write Java software for Nokia phones. Borland executives said they plan to offer Java tools for other cell phone manufacturers in the future. WebGain, formerly Symantec's Java tools division, also announced new versions of its tools, which include features such as the ability to test and debug software. Even Intel is getting into the act, ponying up cash to be a gold sponsor of the software show, despite its hardware rivalry with Sun. Intel will tout its Developer Services for Java, a program to help companies fine-tune and promote their Java software running on Intel-based computers. The Intel program also makes it easier for programmers to get access to computers that use Intel's new Itanium server chip. IBM is providing Java programming tools for Itanium, Intel said. Also on the hardware front, IBM will announce that it has beaten Sun and Hewlett-Packard in releasing Java for use on 64-bit servers--a development that allows the use of much more memory than that available with 32-bit Java. The new IBM Java Developer Kit, version 1.3.0, works on IBM's Unix servers. Big Blue, which is Java's biggest supporter after Sun, also will boast that its servers outpace Sun's own on Java speed measurements. News.com's Stephen Shankland contributed to this report.
2000-03-30 - Tech shares lead broad sell-off    The week-long sell-off in tech stocks continued today as the Nasdaq composite index plunged nearly 300 points but later partially recovered. The Nasdaq closed down 186.78, or about 4 percent, to 4,457.89, its fifth-worst point drop ever. With about 30 minutes left in the trading day, the tech-heavy index was down about 289 points, but an 11th-hour rally trimmed the decline. The Nasdaq has declined each day this week, a slide that has cut about 10 percent from its value in those four days. Since March 10, the index is off about 13 percent. "Technology stocks were extended, and they needed a pullback," said Bryan Rauscher, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "People were trying to cut some of the tech weighting in their portfolios." He added that the next few weeks will indicate "how much of the pullback is real, and how much is just funds doing some window dressing." The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 20.60 to 1,487.92, and the Dow Jones industrial average slid 38.47 to close at 10,980.25. The CNET tech index lost 132.13, or nearly 4 percent, to close at 3,269.82, dragged down by shares of Cabletron Systems and Seagate Technology. Losers vastly outnumbered gainers, with 86 of the 100 stocks in the index falling, 12 rising and two remaining unchanged. Of the 18 sectors tracked, computer memory companies posted the sharpest drop, falling a whopping 9 percent. Computer distributors were the day's largest gainers, climbing a slim 0.4 percent. Intel closed down $4.88 at $127, while Microsoft fell $3.81 to $103.38. A former Intel employee was indicted by a U.S. grand jury on charges of stealing trade secrets about the company's upcoming "Itanium" microprocessor. The initial offering of Luminex, a biotech company, was the biggest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares jumped $5.88, or 34 percent, to $22.88. Volume topped 5.5 million shares. Among members of the CNET tech index, Cabletron and Seagate posted sharp declines. Cabletron fell $21.13, or 42 percent, to $28.75 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the company over concerns that its split would hurt sales and earnings for several quarters. Seagate fell $7.50 to $66.50 on volume of 21.5 million shares, more than 10 times the stock's average daily volume. Seagate announced yesterday that it will be bought by Veritas Software and an investment group in a $20 billion deal. Veritas closed up $2.75 at $145.25. The drop in Seagate's shares, however, should be put in perspective: At the close of regular trading yesterday, the shares were at $62.75. After the deal with Veritas was announced, the shares jumped to about $74 in after-hours trading. Today's decline represents the pullback from the gains posted after the markets closed yesterday. Citrix Systems fell $13.75, or 16 percent, to $72.13 on a volume of 20.1 million shares, more than 19 times the stock's daily average, from fears that it will miss next quarter's earnings expectations. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 42.49, or 3 percent, to 1,151.31, led by Micron Technology and Altera. Micron fell $13.50 to $121,and Altera fell $8.50 to $76.38--a 10 percent drop for both stocks. Micron said yesterday that it will split its shares 2-for-1. Shares of Yahoo fell $7.56 to $169.50. The company said today that the Federal Trade Commission is investigating the Web site's consumer data practices. Dell Computer has named James Schneider chief financial officer, taking the place of Thomas Meredith. The computer maker's shares fell $1.63 to $52.19.
2001-10-10 - Tech luminaries grace Gartner confab   More than 6,000 information-technology professionals gathered at the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo 2001 in Orlando, Fla., this week.

2000-05-17 - Tech giants team to push server "clusters" IBM and Microsoft have joined to offer prepackaged two-computer "clusters" of servers at a discounted price, a harbinger of things to come for Intel-based computers. One variety of clustering lets one computer take over when another fails. Another shares tasks among a group of computers, effectively making one larger, faster computer out of a group of smaller ones. Either way, Intel is interested in clustering because it allows computers using its chips to penetrate new, high-profit markets. Intel's plans for clustering will get even more aggressive when systems based on its new Itanium chip arrive later this year, sources close to the company have said. The 64-bit nature of the Itanium chip will allow it to manage much larger databases and perform calculations much faster, making it a good match for Intel's clustering push. Intel is expected to pump lots of money into research, development and marketing for clusters, sources have said. Clustering has been around for years, but with Intel servers running either Windows or Linux, it's only beginning to catch up with Unix clustering, said Giga Information Group analyst Richard Fichera. Now, however, clustering is becoming an increasingly mainstream product. "As a percentage of shipments, it's fairly small, but it's growing rapidly," Fichera said. Fichera expects Intel to invest in the software underpinnings that make clustering possible. Compaq and Santa Cruz Operations have strong Unix clustering products, and Sun is scheduled to upgrade its own offering, "Full Moon," in November, a source familiar with the company's plans said. But clusters are expensive. As part of an effort to reduce the sticker shock that often deters customers from these higher-end server systems, IBM and Microsoft are evenly splitting the cost of a 20 percent discount, said Alex Yost, manager of marketing for IBM's Netfinity server line. "We each took a piece out of the price," he said. "Nobody has the same deal with Microsoft that we've got." One cluster product, using the two-processor 5100, will have a starting price of $19,499, Yost said. The rack-mounted 4500r, another two-processor machine, will have prices starting at $24,999, including a flat-panel monitor. Despite the discounts, "We're still profitable on the individual units," Yost said, because the customers still will be buying more expensive and powerful configurations. The target market for the servers is small and mid-sized businesses that wouldn't otherwise be inclined to pay for high-end features such as clustering. Another is the branch offices of larger corporations that would prefer clustering for sites with minimal technical support expertise. "This is designed to bring clustering to the masses," Yost said. One reason IBM, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Dell and others are interested in clustering is that companies can often sell services such as customization or support along with the hardware, Fichera said. That strategy appeals in particular to services-strong companies such as IBM or EMC's Data General. "It makes sense to discount the cluster," Fichera said. "It's probably an opportunity for them to pull through professional services." The IBM approach is designed for "failover," in which one computer takes over for another. Another popular way to use clusters is in a "Beowulf" configuration, which distributes mathematical calculations among a host of networked computers. Compaq's high-performance Alpha chip is particularly popular for this method, but Intel's Itanium will provide stronger competition than the current Intel chips.
2002-12-12 - Tech giants prep high-powered databases    Oracle says it will be the first out of the gate when it ships later this month a 64-bit version of its flagship Oracle 9i database optimized for Intel's Itanium 2 on HP-UX, Hewlett-Packard's version of the Unix operating system. Versions for Linux and Windows on Itanium 2 are slated for early next year. In April next year, Microsoft will match Oracle with a 64-bit version of its SQL Server 2000 for Itanium 2 when the company ships its first 64-bit operating system, Windows .Net Server 2003. For its part, IBM is readying for April of next year a 64-bit version of its DB2 8.1 database for Windows .Net Server and Linux. The 64-bit versions of these databases could be a real bargain for companies that need the additional horsepower. Database makers said the cost will be the same as the existing 32-bit versions. Although technically impressive, 64-bit applications have remained within a rarified group of customers because they require that applications be rewritten or modified to take advantage of the powerful hardware. With the release of servers built around Intel's Itanium 2 and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron 64-bit processors next year, IT companies are hoping use of 64-bit systems will expand beyond leading-edge technology adopters. But because most applications are designed for existing 32-bit Intel-compatible processors, the great majority of companies will be well-served by sticking with their current choice in hardware, analyst said. "People who have very large decision-support databases and who want more cache memory, they want 64-bit systems yesterday," said Jonathan Eunice, principle analyst at research firm Illuminata. "But for the average sales support or inventory management database, frankly those applications could be suitable on 32-bit systems for five or 10 years at least." But as companies consider their hardware server upgrade options next year, high-end 64-bit databases--and their ability to handle complex data and transactions--will start to become more common, IDC analyst Carl Olofson said. "It will be more an evolution than a revolution in the database world. People are not going to cash in their existing systems because there's something new out there," Olofson said. "But as they are migrating, they will take a look at migrating to a 64-bit database system in the normal course of upgrading their server." The release of 64-bit servers based on Intel and AMD processors may accelerate the move from expensive Unix systems and may increase sales of the Linux operating system, Olofson said. The availability of higher-end database systems for Intel and AMD processors isn't expected to significantly shake up the market share rankings for relational database management systems, he said. Gaining ground In 2001, Oracle held the lead with 43 percent of the market of relational databases on all operating systems, followed by IBM with 31 percent and Microsoft with 9 percent, according to IDC. Because of Oracle's dropping database revenue this year, Olofson expects IBM to gain some ground on last year's market share leader. High-end 64-bit servers and databases traditionally have been used for the most demanding applications, such as high-volume e-commerce sites or huge data stores to analyze corporate operations. Databases optimized for 64-bit hardware can store great amounts of data--up to hundreds of gigabytes--in a computer's memory. Without the need to fetch data from a disk for every database query or transaction, so-called in-memory databases greatly quicken application performance and response time. Although the number of applications that take advantage of 64-bit technology remains relatively small, the hardware may garner more ="966834">interest from companies looking to consolidate servers. Increasing pressure on IT organizations to save money is driving a wave of server consolidation, where multiple machines are replaced by fewer, more powerful boxes. Landspitali University Hospital in Reykjavik, Iceland, is transitioning from a four-processor server to two single-processor Itanium 2 machines to run its Oracle e-business application suite. The hospital was originally seeking a way to add redundancy to its applications in case its single server failed, but it found that the new configuration will provide sufficient processing power at a lower price. Because Oracle charges a per-processor fee for its software, the total cost of its back-end system will go down by moving to a cluster of two more powerful 64-bit machines, said Olafur Adalsteinsson, IT manager at Landspitali University Hospital. "We did a request for proposal from the major companies and found that the Itanium 2 servers were maybe 15 or 20 percent more expensive than others. But if you compare all the costs, including the software licensing, it was a much cheaper solution," Adalsteinsson said. The hospital not only gains equivalent performance, but also redundancy and backup if one server fails, he said. Server consolidation also has cost savings associated with IT labor and management, said Jeff Jones, director of strategy for IBM data management solutions. "A single platform vastly simplifies hardware administration. And the database performance is improved because you're not dealing with as many network connections," he said. Large corporate users have traditionally used mainframe or high-end Unix systems to consolidate multiple servers, using partitioning software to manage multiple applications among processors on a single machine. Muscling in Until now, 64-bit databases have run exclusively on Unix servers from IBM, Sun Microsystems, HP and others, which build machines around their proprietary chip architectures. By ="975472">muscling into the realm of 64-bit computing, Microsoft and Intel intend to dethrone so-called big iron hardware, or mainframes and high-end Unix servers long the bastion of IBM, Sun and HP. "Because Itanium 2 gives such a great cost of ownership, it makes (64-bit systems) a lot more approachable for many customers," said Sheryl Tullis, product manager for Microsoft's SQL Server database. "If companies want room to grow, they can do it much cheaper than Unix and with less complexity than a mainframe. That's where we see the tide turning." HP and Unisys already sell Itanium 2 servers, while IBM plans to ship its own early next year. AMD will also be ="966171">girding for a piece of the high-end server market when it ships its 64-bit Opteron processor in the first half of next year. While existing 32-bit applications need to be ="976150">optimized to take full advantage of the Itanium 2 processor, AMD's ="962312">Opteron is designed to run both 32-bit and 64-bit applications unchanged. AMD's Opteron "is a nice smooth migration story from 32 bit to 64 bit without having to go through the application adjustment process," said IBM's Jones. "Companies don't have to make changes or suffer performance degradation." But even broadening the number of 64-bit server suppliers beyond the established Unix base will not dramatically shake up generally lackluster server ="966929">sales, analysts said. "I can't see the introduction of a new processor getting too many CIOs excited in the current climate," said James Governor, an analyst at RedMonk. "They have better things to worry about than a new architecture without a great deal of application support."
2006-10-24 - Tech giants court mainframe customers  SAN FRANCISCO--Technology trends come and go, but the old mainframe never seems to completely disappear. At Oracle's OpenWorld conference here Tuesday, the mainframe computer figured prominently. During a keynote address, Hewlett-Packard CEO Mark Hurd said the company is launching a service with Oracle and Intel that will help customers move old applications running on mainframes to HP servers using Intel's Itanium processors and Oracle's application software. Video: HP's Hurd tackles efficiency HP chief says organizations should try to move toward automation when it comes to maintenance. In his speech, Hurd noted that HP is in the middle of a three-year plan to modernize and streamline its back-office technology, and mainframes have no place within that plan. "I'm not a big fan of mainframes," Hurd said to the surprise of few. Around 65 percent of IT budgets are spent on keeping mainframes up and running, Hurd said. He wants his own organization to move away from maintenance projects, automating as much of the IT department work as possible under Chief Information Officer Randy Mott. This will also reduce the number of servers and applications that HP maintains, helping cut cooling and power costs, he said. HP, Intel and Oracle plan to assess a customer's application requirements and recommend a similar application that runs on an Itanium server, helping the wary mainframe customer make the leap. But in a separate announcement, Oracle played the other side of the fence: It provided a show of support for the mainframe in a partnership with IBM. Technology executives tend to be pretty conservative folks, hewing to that old strategy, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Plenty of customers are content to run important applications on mainframes that they know inside and out. IBM and Oracle are eyeing those customers with a collaborative effort to sell Oracle applications to IBM's System Z mainframe customers running Linux, the companies said Tuesday.

2001-10-22 - Taking a second look at HP-Compaq  Hewlett-Packard's announcement to purchase beleaguered Compaq Computer has been met with a resounding vote of no confidence from the investment community. The deal has run into a wall of skepticism because the intrinsic integration and execution risks have been heightened significantly by the checkered execution histories of both these companies--not to mention the significant revenue leakage as vendors like Dell Computer capitalize on the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) factor. However, the combination of the two companies does create an incredibly broad product line that in some ways surpasses even IBM's. Compaq's fault-tolerant systems, product lines acquired through its Tandem acquisition, provide the extreme reliability required in key markets. With technology from its Convex purchase, HP offers some of the most powerful scientific computers in the world. Both companies also offer a range of traditional servers from a single processor to dozens of processors. Merging product lines Compaq's recent decision to abandon its proprietary Alpha microprocessors helped pave the way for this merger. HP was already in the process of phasing out its proprietary PA-RISC microprocessors, and both companies are converging on Intel's Itanium as their server processor of choice. Thus, after some transition period, the combined company can focus on a single server hardware platform. The move from proprietary platforms to industry-standard Intel servers is putting pressure on margins at both companies. HP recently terminated an internal Itanium chipset, transferring the design and the design team to Intel, because it couldn't afford the effort. On the other hand, both companies have significant server hardware design expertise and have emphasized hardware differentiation in the past. The merger will allow them to spread the investment in Itanium hardware across a broader range of systems with a larger revenue stream, enabling continued differentiation despite lower system margins. The software story is more complex. Compaq's software situation has been a mess due to its acquisitions of Digital and Tandem, each of which had two proprietary operating systems, one Unix and one non-Unix. HP has its own pair of proprietary operating systems: HP-UX Unix and MPE. In the short term, the merged company can continue to support a variety of operating systems on a common Itanium platform. Compaq had already planned to shift most of its Itanium systems to the "Monterey" unified Unix developed by IBM and SCO. The merger will put pressure on HP, the only major holdout from the Monterey effort, to merge HP-UX into Monterey, although this is not likely to happen in the short term. Ultimately, we expect the new company will significantly pare back its support for legacy proprietary operating systems. An additional concern will be porting the Tandem fault-tolerant OS technology to the next-generation fault-tolerant Itanium systems.Taking on IBM and Sun Compared with IBM, the new company will have a much larger share of the Itanium server market, allowing it to deliver better technology at a lower cost. IBM's strategy is to split its efforts across its proprietary PowerPC platforms as well as its Itanium products. We expect Itanium to become the dominant server platform, making IBM's strategy questionable and giving HP-Compaq a leg up. The combined company will also be better able to take on Sun Microsystems, which surpassed HP in overall server market share. The merged company will have larger server revenue than Sun--or any other company. Sun's market leadership has given it an economy of scale that helps reduce the impact of its research and development costs. The new HP will have the same economy of scale, plus the benefit of not needing to develop its own microprocessors. (Although HP continues to engage in joint development with Intel on Itanium processors, we expect Intel to acquire HP's processor design team in the next six to 12 months.) Furthermore, HP will benefit from the industry momentum behind Itanium, with more than 20 companies developing or selling Itanium systems and many more developing Itanium software. Sun is the only major proponent of its SPARC platform. As the industry shifts from proprietary platforms to Itanium, we expect HP will benefit as the leading supplier of Itanium systems, and Sun will become isolated.Challenges ahead There are many potential pitfalls in executing this strategy. To realize the projected $2.5 billion in cost savings will require a large number of layoffs, including in the server area. HP has already endured multiple rounds of layoffs under CEO Carly Fiorina, and many have not been handled well, resulting in poor morale. Compaq employees have been trained to view HP in a hostile fashion, and soothing these feelings will not be simple. A major challenge will be retaining key personnel through the massive restructurings that the merger will require. A maturing and commoditized PC and enterprise market mandates structural changes to the business model, which will not manifest in the HP-Compaq merger. Focus will shift from revenue growth to revenue maintenance with increased emphasis on cost reduction as the route to profitability. Too many merger candidates lose their revenue momentum as they concentrate on cost synergies. Fluctuations in revenue can quickly outweigh fluctuations in cost savings. For a 1 percent shortfall in revenue, a merger can stay on track to create value if cost savings are 25 percent higher than anticipated (McKinsey, et al). As such, the expected revenue leakage (10 percent to 15 percent) will completely mask the purported cost savings. If they stay apart--still a high probability--both Compaq and HP could at least maintain industry growth rates. Bridging customers through the transition will be another challenge. More than a decade ago, HP briefly became the No. 1 workstation vendor by acquiring Apollo; by the time the acquisition was closed, however, many of Apollo's customers had already fled, and HP was never able to wrest the workstation crown from Sun. To make sure the new acquisition does not encounter the same fate, HP must quickly assure Compaq's customers that it will continue to support key hardware and software platforms even as it begins to reduce costs by rationalizing the product lines. Does the inexperienced CEO Fiorina have the deft touch required to pull this off? We will soon find out.
2002-12-16 - Sybase readies high-end database   Sybase and Hewlett-Packard said Monday that they would jointly develop a version of Sybase's Adapter Server Enterprise database software for HP's Itanium 2 servers. The company's Itanium 2-optimized database, which is slated for completion some time in 2003, will run on the HP-UX Unix operating system and Red Hat Linux. Intel's Itanium 2 chip is a 64-bit processor and is most suited for computer-intensive applications that store large amounts of data in a server's memory. Sybase executives said demand for the 64-bit version of Adaptive Server Enterprise is coming primarily from its clients in the financial industry and from makers of high-tech equipment. The software company is also considering whether to modify its database server for Advanced Micro Devices' 64-bit Opteron processor, but has not announced definite plans, executives said. Sybase joins other database makers, such as Oracle, Microsoft and IBM, that have voiced plans to build versions of their databases for the Itanium 2.
2005-07-29 - SWsoft brings virtualization to Itanium    SWsoft has released an Itanium version of its Virtuozzo software, which lets a single server operating system appear to be several separate copies the company calls virtual private servers. The new software for the higher-end Intel processor family is available for Linux today and will be available for Windows in the future, the company said. The company charges $999 per processor for the software. Virtualization, technology that generally makes computers into a more flexible and efficient foundation, is a hot area in the industry today. SWsoft rival EMC doesn't offer Itanium versions of its software, choosing to focus on the higher-volume market for servers based on x86 chips such as Intel's Xeon.
2003-10-27 - SuSE signs up key software partner SuSE Linux has enlisted the backing of server-software maker Veritas Software, an important step in supporting the needs of business computing and keeping up with top Linux seller Red Hat. Veritas and SuSE announced on Monday that they will cooperate in sales as well as technology. Get Up to Speed on... Open source Get the latest headlines andcompany-specific news in ourexpanded GUTS section. "The relationship between the two companies will enable joint engineering, joint support and joint marketing so we can sell into each other's customer bases," said Ranajit Nevatia, director of Veritas' Linux strategy. In January, Veritas will begin selling SuSE versions of two of its key server products--two years after it began offering Red Hat versions. The company plans to make the announcement at LinuxWorld Frankfurt. The software packages are Veritas' Foundation Suite, which consists of file system software and a volume manager to make storage systems faster and more flexible, and its Cluster Server software to let one computer take over if another in a group fails. The software will work with the SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), SuSE's corporate operating system product, Nevatia said. "This certainly plugs a relative gap in SuSE's product line compared to what Red Hat has," said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. SuSE hopes the support will help it gain higher-end customers. "The significance of this announcement is that SuSE expands into the corporate data center. This shows SuSE can provide data integrity that enterprise customers are looking for," said Uwe Heine, SuSE's chief alliance officer. The new software will make it easier for Unix customers to adopt Linux, Haff said. "It makes that move from a lot of Unix systems, and from Sun in particular, easier than it was before," he said. Sun Microsystems' Solaris is the most widely used version of Unix and a prime candidate for companies that want to save costs by using Linux on less-expensive Intel-based hardware. Veritas' software makes such switches simpler by unifying the way information is stored regardless of which operating system is using the data. Veritas will support SuSE's product line in stages, Nevatia said. First will come support for the version for "x86" processors, such as Intel's Xeon or Advanced Micro Devices' Athlon. Later will come support for SuSE Linux running on Intel's Itanium and IBM's zSeries mainframes. AMD's Opteron processor, which can run x86 software but also departs from that design with support for 64-bit software, is another question. "The Opteron platform is still being investigated," Nevatia said, as is support for IBM's pSeries Unix servers and iSeries midrange servers. Pricing for the Linux and Unix versions is comparable for higher-end servers. At the lower end, however, it's cheaper on Linux, Nevatia said. Veritas has other software packages with SuSE support. Its backup software already is available for SuSE Linux, and in November Veritas will release a SuSE version of its OpForce software, which lets administrators remotely install and control the software that runs on a server, Nevatia said.
2000-07-24 - SuSE rolls ahead despite Linux shakeout    July 24, 2000, Dirk Hohndel SuSE rolls ahead despite Linux shakeout By Stephen Shankland Staff Writer, CNET NEWS.COM Wall Street may be cautious on Linux these days, but that's not discouraging Dirk Hohndel, chief technology officer of German software and services firm SuSE. "Yes, we are planning a public offering," Hohndel said in an interview with CNET News.com. Though he declined to offer further details, such as when the IPO might take place, SuSE spokesman Carter Kohlmeyer said in an earlier interview that an offering likely would be structured to take advantage of stock markets in both the United States and Europe. The move is bold, given the troubles experienced by support firm Linuxcare, layoffs at TurboLinux and the overall cooling trend affecting Linux firms. Although SuSE wasn't profitable last year, it was in 1998 and garnered a substantial $21.4 million in revenue for 1999. SuSE is one of the traditional Linux companies, like Red Hat, TurboLinux and Caldera Systems, selling a version of the freely available and cooperatively developed operating system. SuSE, with 460 employees, is one of the top four companies, according to market researcher International Data Corp. Linux, though once a Wall Street darling, hasn't proved to be a panacea for the troubles of SGI, Santa Cruz Operation or Corel, each of which has seen its stock price plummet despite announcing major Linux initiatives. A clone of Unix and a competitor with Windows, Linux has passed through the difficult stage of winning respect from major computer sellers such as Hewlett-Packard, Dell Computer, IBM and Compaq Computer. But investors now are more demanding. Linux companies are no longer assumed to be an easy path to riches, and most of the new crop of Linux companies focus on specialty areas such as cramming Linux into tiny devices or making it suitable for crash-proof servers. Not SuSE. In an interview with News.com, Hohndel described his company's plans for making money the old-fashioned open-source way, selling service and support. Selling services for free software has been widely espoused in the open-source world, but while SuSE and Red Hat embraced it, Caldera Systems and TurboLinux opted for other strategies. CNET News.com: How is SuSE different from other Linux companies? Hohndel: The key point is what you are offering. We see ourselves as one of the leading technology providers, with a strong focus on our customer needs. In practice, that's obvious, but we have key differentiating factors. You need to have a very big development staff actively involved in the open-source community. You can't simply sit there and wait for the open-source community to do something. You need staff with in-depth knowledge in order to provide excellent service and support. We see Linux as the future operating system in the server space and a very strong contender in the desktop space...It's not just the operating system, it's the services and support you're able to offer around them. Some people have said that since the departure of Marc Torres to Atipa Linux Solutions, your management in the U.S. market has been weak. I don't think we're weak in the U.S. at all. We have very enthusiastic customers (such as) Oracle and SGI. Of course, there's always room for improvement, and we are actively trying to improve our market communication. If you are the first company to arrive and you don't provide the service you promise, you aren't going to succeed. What are SuSE's revenues? We (were) profitable in 1998. We started very aggressive growth in late 1998. Aggressive growth obviously means that your revenues are somewhat behind your growth on your cost side. We currently are not profitable, but we are optimistic to become so again. Our revenue was 23 million euros ($21.4 million) in 1999. How serious are you about the services business? Obviously we are very serious about this. Services is one of the key business areas for SuSE. No one actually buys an operating system in a commercial environment. People in a company are looking for solutions, and an operating system is a tool to provide a solution and nothing more. Without providing services, there is not much point in addressing a commercial market. We're rolling out services on a global basis...using a staged approach. Usually we start new services in the German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), which is our home area. The next step is the United States, further to the rest of Europe, and then the rest of the world. So you now offer around-the-clock support? You can purchase 7-by-24 support in German-speaking countries. You can purchase contracts...depending on the response times you need. The categories of support are silver, gold and platinum. Silver costs 4,200 euros ($3,900) per year. Platinum costs 36,800 euros ($34,200) per year, with a one-hour response time. Is there any competition for Linux services in Europe? At this point, there is no real competition. I expect established hardware vendors like Hewlett-Packard or IBM are going to offer similar services at some point, and I expect some other Linux players are going to do that. What about services in the United States? We have professional services out of our Oakland (Calif.) office for things like consulting and implementation. There are half a dozen people who are exclusively working in consulting and professional services and have another dozen working in areas of support and engineering. How hard is it to hire Linux personnel? Linux is a very, very hot topic. A lot of people like to work in the Linux industry, so hiring people is easy compared to traditional business. But Silicon Valley is an extremely competitive job market. What's SuSE's position with helping open-source programming efforts, in particular the XFree86 project for a Linux graphical user interface? The desktop is a very important area for Linux. Ignoring the desktop is one of the major mistakes the Unix vendors did in the Unix wars. We are investing a lot both in sponsorships and manpower. Four of the XFree86 members are on staff, me being one of them. In the desktop environment, we have four of KDE's top developers on staff as well. What do you think about the lack of a settled standard for Linux desktop user interfaces? I'm very happy to see the competition between Gnome and KDE. Monoculture and monopolies...strangle innovation. But an important part is to make sure interoperability and standardization is not left out of the picture. Are you interested in Linux on embedded devices? We are actively involved in this area. But finding a solid revenue model around the embedded market is not easy. We currently focus on the server space and the desktop space. How important to you is Itanium, the first generation of Intel's IA-64 family? Itanium is a very important project. We made available our Itanium distribution three weeks ago. It will be ready when the processors ship. Linux on IA-64 is already remarkably stable.Will Linux on Itanium provide SuSE minor or significant revenue? It's hard to say. It depends on Intel's ability to get volume shipments out this year. I'm certain once Itanium ships in volume, Linux will be the key operating system used on there.
2004-07-13 - Supercomputing center adds more power  The National Center for Supercomputing Applications, one of the larger of supercomputers, said Tuesday that it has purchased an SGI supercomputer called Cobalt that will contain 1,024 Itanium 2 processors, three terabytes of memory and 370 terabytes of disk storage when completely operational. With a peak performance of more than 6 teraflops, Cobalt will bring the total computing power at the NCSA to more than 35 teraflops and raise disk storage to 750 terabytes, according to the center. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory recently erected an Itanium 2 supercomputer with 4,096 processors. In March, the NCSA said it had an open proposal for a supercomputer but did not say which companies were in the running for the contract.
2002-12-17 - Sun's UltraSparc doubles down for power    Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc IV chip will debut in the second half of 2003 with two processors etched into the same slice of silicon, a technique that packs more computing punch, a company executive said Monday. Using so-called dual-core processors is an important step in taking advantage of chip manufacturing advances to make server computers more powerful without consuming much more power. IBM already has made the switch to this dual-core technology with its Power4 processor. Sun and Hewlett-Packard are next in line, while Intel's Itanium won't make it to dual-core models until mid-decade. Sun's dual-core technology will first emerge in the UltraSparc IV processor, Andy Ingram, vice president of marketing at Sun, said in a media briefing. UltraSparc IV is important not just because it's a new, faster chip, but because Sun's existing servers will accommodate it. That upgrade option can be a draw for customers who buy servers they expect to use for years. Sun now has prototype UltraSparc IV processors in hand, Ingram said. Texas Instruments builds Sun's high-end processors. Sun Chief Executive Scott McNealy said in October that servers using UltraSparc IV would begin shipping about a year from then. Sun also has prototypes of the UltraSparc IIIi processor, code-named Jalapeno, a product with high-speed cache memory integrated into the chip, a company representative said. HP uses its own PA-RISC processors in its servers and is moving to Intel's Itanium, which HP helped design. PA-RISC will become a dual-core product when HP puts two of its current PA-8700 chips onto the same silicon to become the PA-8800, code-named Mako. The processor is expected to run at 1GHz speeds, HP has said. Even though dual-core Itaniums won't arrive for years, News.com Special Report Vision Series 3 20 minds on tech's future HP plans to package regular Itanium chips in two-chip modules that serve a similar purpose. The strategy will permit the creation of mammoth 128-processor servers. One reason Itanium will be a relatively late arrival to the dual-core realm is its large size, said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. Because there are practical limits to the physical size of a chip, it's harder to squeeze two large processors onto a single piece of silicon. Much of Itanium's surface area is occupied by its cache memory; the next-generation Madison version of Itanium will come with as much as 6MB of cache.
2005-10-31 - Sun's Solaris now an option for IBM blades Sun Microsystems and IBM have come to a pragmatic accommodation, under which Sun's Solaris 10 operating system will be a supported option for IBM's BladeCenter servers. Sun President Jonathan Schwartz announced the move last week in his blog. IBM will help optimize Solaris for IBM hardware, he said. "We've signed up our first tier 1 systems vendor as a Solaris supporter: It's IBM, and their decision to provide comprehensive support for Solaris on BladeCenter definitely puts them ahead of the other blade vendors in offering a truly OS-neutral product," Schwartz said in his blog. IBM confirmed the move in a statement, saying Sun is among more than 700 partners in the "BladeCenter ecosystem" and that as an operating system option, Solaris joins Windows, Linux for x86 and Power chips, and IBM's AIX version of Unix. IBM won't sell Solaris or support for the operating system to customers, IBM said. Anyone interested will have to purchase the software and support from Sun. Sun has been trying to spread its Solaris operating system widely--in particular the version that runs on x86 processors such as Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron. It's also making the software open-source and letting anyone use it for free. All these moves contrast with IBM's proprietary AIX. It's still unclear whether Sun will jump aboard IBM's effort, joined by Intel, to make the BladeCenter into a de facto standard for blade servers. Today, the design accommodates blade servers that use one of three processors--Intel's Xeon, Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron and IBM's PowerPC 970--so there's nothing technological preventing other processors, such as Sun's Niagara, from being used. Sun and IBM began cooperating on more than one front recently. For example, IBM is working on versions of its server software for Sun's Solaris x86 version. But a similar hardware alliance isn't likely, Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff said. "That would surprise me greatly," he said. Sun has said its new blade servers will debut in early 2006, but the company declined to comment on the possibility of using IBM's blades. "We are developing a new generation of blade products based on an innovative architecture that is designed to take blades to the mainstream. Beyond that, we cannot disclose further details of any unannounced products," spokeswoman Liza Curran said. IBM declined to comment on whether Sun would use the BladeCenter specification for its server. IBM and Hewlett-Packard dominate the blade server market. On Tuesday, HP is expected to add an Itanium processor option to its blade line, letting the systems run its HP-UX version of Unix.
2006-06-20 - Sun's server guy peers ahead   John Fowler doesn't have the easiest job in the world. As executive vice president for systems at Sun Microsystems, he oversees servers, the product category that generates most of Sun's revenue. But these are tough times for the one-time Silicon Valley highflier. The company still struggles with large financial losses and has announced layoffs. All the uncertainty has led some analysts to speculate that Sun is destined to become an acquisition target. Fowler is having none of it. He notes that Sun's server revenue was up in the last quarter--a period during which most server makers suffered declines in server sales. Also, the company's sales of Advanced Micro Devices-based servers grew. And so what if Intel has a new server chip coming out? If demand exists, Fowler suggested, Sun might even adopt the chip. He recently spoke with CNET News.com about these and other issues affecting Sun and the chip business. Q: What's the benefit of combining the x86 server group with the Sparc group? Fowler: What's been happening is the two groups have been doing things like sharing mechanical design and doing some aspects of the systems work together. It will be a more clear dynamic when it's all one group. For example, service management software can all be shared very quickly and easily between the systems. The other thing that we can do is, from a portfolio management standpoint, is continually adjusting the family of products to maximize our growth. As you probably know, we grew 7.6 percent last quarter. There are a lot of opportunities in other areas like the factory operations and supply chain. The x64 group had a separate operations team. I'd like to be your worst-case scenario customer for a moment. So I'll say, "Well, you lost millions of dollars in the last quarter, and had losses in the previous quarters, and you are laying a lot of people off. How do I know Sun's going to be an independent company?" Fowler: I think the important thing about looking at sort of paper losses and GAAP losses and all that is that we continue to maintain a strong R&D portfolio and a strong cash position, which is sort of what drove the 7.6 percent growth in the last quarter. We don't have any debts; we have an extremely strong cash position; and we've got a very stable and increasing revenue base, so we're in actually a pretty good spot from that regard. Obviously we have Solaris and a lot of opportunities to compete against IBM, despite the fact we're smaller in scale. Right, but you are laying people off. You'll obviously have fewer engineers. Do you worry that you won't be able to continue to innovate at the same pace as IBM or even Hewlett-Packard? Fowler: I think we've obviously been through a very long history competing with IBM, which has a much bigger work force. If you'll look at their portfolio, there are a lot of businesses that we are in fact not in, so it's not fair to jump or take a direct comparison. But against Power and the X series products and other parts of the stack, obviously we have Solaris and a lot of opportunities to compete against IBM, despite the fact we're smaller in scale. Remember that IBM has a huge number of people which are actually part of the service group. In the case of HP, of course, it's a very different profile of a company. Competing against HP obviously involves emphasizing the areas of portfolio where we are different: the Sparc portfolio, Niagara. Aggravating customer question No. 2. So you are selling a lot of x86 servers. But why should I buy them from you guys? There are a lot of people out there with them. Fowler: When we develop our products and, of course, we're on the cusp of announcing a whole collection of more products, we work basically on five principles. The five principles are: performance; efficiency--and efficiency relates to both our size and power performance; No. 3 is reliability, which is of course the whole availability track; and then manageability, which is how well can you integrate it into an environment of hundreds and thousands; and then the fifth is what I call longevity. These are the big five: performance, efficiency, reliability, availability, manageability and longevity. If you look at our x64 products, we have the first four very much nailed. These are the big five: performance, efficiency, reliability, availability, manageability and longevity. If you look at our x64 products, we have the first four very much nailed. We are fast and extremely power-efficient. We're manageable and have a lot of reliability features, so that makes us clearly a top tier-one vendor. If you look at our x64 growth rate, we are seven quarters in with really high double-digit or triple-digit kind of growth rates. I can't talk about the growth in the current quarter, but the competitive landscape hasn't really changed. You don't get eight quarters of growth in that rate by accident. People obviously like what we are doing. The last point I want to talk about is longevity. You're familiar with longevity in the Sparc line. You can install an UltraSparc IV machine and keep upgrading it over time. The products that we are going to introduce next will really bring that to x64. You'll be able to incorporate our blade server into your infrastructure so that future processors, future memory, future I/O (input/output) and other aspects of the system can be continually changed over time without rip and replace. This is quite new for the x64 area, and we think it will really resonate with customers. The other thing, obviously, in terms of growth is Solaris and x64. We have a majority of Solaris licenses which are actually on hardware other than Sun. Is that Solaris x86 or that's Solaris everything? Fowler: Solaris x86. If you look at it numerically, the majority of that is actually on HP hardware. So when you ask why would people want to buy things from me, well people have become interested in Solaris, and they may want to also purchase hardware over time from Sun because obviously we're optimizing and supporting them together. Does Sun charge for Solaris x86, or is that one of the free software products? Fowler: It's free. You download it from Sun. You have access to base level updates for security patches as well as other information. If you want to have advanced support, then there is a service plan for it. What percentage of your revenue is x86? Fowler: It's still small. If you look at comments (former CEO) Scott McNealy made, he said that the server part of x64 is a nice little $400 million business. I think it's more fairly classified at around 10 percent of our top line, but growing rapidly. Everyone is queuing up for a Woodcrest. Do you think Intel will change the competitive picture with it? Fowler: I think Woodcrest is obviously a much more competitive product from what we've seen so far, but it remains to be seen how well it does in a variety of customer applications. Just like anyone else, I am always very cautious about what I call bench marketing. Not that we would do that of course. I think Woodcrest is obviously a much more competitive product from what we've seen so far, but it remains to be seen how well it does in a variety of customer applications. But it (Woodcrest) certainly increases the competitive profile. We've always been in a situation where we want a chip we believe to be the best product in the marketplace, and we don't have any issues with Intel Woodcrest and other forthcoming processors becoming things that are highly competitive that customers would want. We wouldn't have any issues adding them into the product line. For us, it's a neutral thing. So you guys would be open to the idea of actually carrying a Woodcrest server? Fowler: Of course. We don't have any kind of strange agreement (with AMD) so AMD knows that...I think the more interesting thing about Woodcrest is that it puts enormous amounts of pressure on the whole Itanium thing. As Intel increases the capability of their x64 Xeon-type platforms, it sort of makes that whole Itanium thing look more and more...interesting. About a year ago, you and I spoke, and I asked you how many people use your x86 servers as 64-bit servers. At the time you said about 70 percent are actually using them for 32-bit apps and 30 percent for 64-bit ones. Has that changed at all? Fowler: I think it's probably gone up a little bit. Obviously people are using Solaris, and Solaris is only 64 bit. On Linux it seems to really vary. In Windows 64 I don't have a real sense of it. So I think we're up a bit from that, but not necessarily some huge amount. Now we can switch over to the Solaris side of things. How are sales going there? Fowler: So obviously we can't talk about the current quarter that much, but the 7.6 percent growth that we had in the last quarter was largely driven by Sparc, because on a dollar it's much higher. The really strong part of the product line that drove sales is UltraSparc IV. But the other thing that's growing rapidly is the Niagara products. Looking at the overall server market, revenue is still relatively flat. Is there anything out there that will move the needle? Fowler: There are a couple of macroeconomic trends that potentially change the server marketplace. When I look at telecommunications going to IP and then consumers demanding videos delivered at high bandwidth to everyone's home, it can certainly drive significant change in the computer market. People are talking about Sarbanes-Oxley. I think there is an opportunity here for some big changes in the storage marketplace. Everyone is talking about the third world, so that's obviously a big thing. Once you get people on the network, we're going to drive exponentially an overall demand. I think that in general the cost of individual aspects of computing will continue to come down. Servers will get smaller and cheaper. Does energy consumption come up a lot in conversations with customers? Fowler: Every single meeting. Everyone has figured out it's a big issue. What I found is that a surprising number of customers get the three basic things mixed up. You have power consumption, which is how much we use from the socket. Then you have efficiency, which is how much work do you get done for what. And then there is power density, which is how much heat do you dissipate in a limited space. Those are the big three issues, and the customers are just sort of now getting to understand the difference between the three and how it affects them. What's the metric people should be looking at? Fowler: I think there are two that people should look at. The first is power efficiency, because that relates to OpEx (operating expenses), and then the second one that people ought to look at is power density. Power density is the amount of heat you dissipate in a small area, and the reason you have to look at that is because that relates to your CapEx (capital expenses). How good is the cooling in your data center? You don't want to rebuild the data centers frequently, so if you built the one level of power density you want it to last for four or five years. When I talk about longevity, the blade servers, what we're going to do is come to people and say "If you built your data center for power density, you will be done for years, because we're going come in and sit within a power envelope. That's the big part of our longevity discussion, which is how do you minimize your repeated CapEx expenditures.
2006-09-12 - Sun's plan for open-source chips bears fruit   A start-up called Simply RISC has built a single-core variant of Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc T1, an indication of interest in Sun's plan to encourage others to adopt and modify open-source designs for the processor. The UltraSparc T1 "Niagara" has eight processing engines, called "cores," but Simply RISC's variant, called the "S1 Core," has only one. It's designed for embedded computing applications such as those in handheld computers, set-top boxes or digital cameras, the company said on its Web site Friday. The company consists of former STMicroelectronics engineers working in Catania, Italy, and in Bristol, England. It has shipped its first S1 Core chip, code-named Sirocco. The chip can run the Unix and Linux operating systems, Simply RISC said. Sun's Solaris version of Unix is chiefly used on Sparc processors, and the server maker is encouraging efforts by Linux programmers to support the UltraSparc T1. The Ubuntu version of Linux already has been adapted for the UltraSparc T1. To infuse new energy into the Sparc processor realm, Sun released hardware designs for its new model. It is trying to build an OpenSparc community of hardware engineers around the chip, similar to the groups of programmers that support and extend open-source software. The Sparc chips, while popular in the 1990s for servers, have lost some ground to high-end chips, such as IBM's Power and Intel's new Itanium. The biggest competition, however, has come from x86 chips, including Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron.
2003-01-24 - Sun's pal Fujitsu to work with Intel   Fujitsu announced Thursday it is joining forces with Intel on a new line of Linux-based servers and mainframe computers, in a move that should stoke the ongoing server war. The Japanese computing giant plans to come out with dual-processor and multiprocessor servers containing Intel's Xeon chips by the end of 2004. A year after that, it expects to release an Intel Itanium-based mainframe-class system that can hold up to 128 processors. In addition, Intel and Fujitsu will collaborate on creating a version of the Linux open-source operating system optimized for Fujitsu systems--especially for its large multiprocessing machines. Over time, the shift toward Intel will likely impact longtime Fujitsu ally Sun Microsystems. With a few exceptions, the Japanese company's servers are built around Solaris--Sun's Unix operating system--and a version of the Sparc RISC chip made by Fujitsu that is similar to Sun's UltraSparc. (Fujitsu-Siemens, a separate joint venture between the two industrialists, sells Intel-based servers in Europe.) While Fujitsu will continue to sell and develop Sparc/Solaris servers, some of the company's energy will inevitably be diverted toward the new Intel/Linux effort. Jack Hirano, a spokesman for Fujitsu, characterized the upcoming Intel/Linux servers one of the three legs of its server strategy--the other two being the existing Primepower server line and GS mainframe line. The new Intel servers will be capable of running other operating systems, including Microsoft's Windows, in addition to Linux, said Hirano. Both Fujitsu's Primepower and GS lines come with Solaris. Sun's collaboration with Fujitsu has allowed it to more deeply penetrate certain markets--such as Japan's--and given the company a high-profile partner to tout its technology. Fujitsu is "out there evangelizing Sparc and Solaris. From that perspective, Sun wants them around," said David Freund, an analyst at consulting firm Illuminata. "The fact that they still have a Sparc-based road map indicates they still have a strong commitment to the Sparc area. But because they have a broad customer base, they have to embrace the other (Intel) processor." Fujitsu also represents an incremental revenue stream for Sun. Not only does the company license Solaris, but many of its servers are made by Sun and then sold under the Fujitsu name, said Shahin Khan, chief competitive officer at Sun. Khan nonetheless downplayed the impact of the deal. "They are kind of a 'me-too' player," he said, with regard to Fujitsu's technology. "They are putting Sparc into areas where (UltraSparc) is not going." Reaching high The new deal also marks Intel's further expansion into the upper echelons of the server market. Although more than 80 percent of servers shipped worldwide contain Intel chips, most of these are one- and two-processor boxes running Windows or Linux, according to various research firms. Over half of the revenue in the global market derives from Unix servers, which typically contain chips such as Sun's UltraSparc or IBM's Power4 and can sell for a million dollar or more. Intel, though, is gaining ground in the four- and eight-processor server segment, which has led to a bitter feud with Sun. "Itanium is the most expensive disaster in the history of high technology," said Khan of Intel's high-end server chip. For their part, Intel executives often bring up Sun as an example of a company that will be a has-been in the near future. Fujitsu had been one of the last major manufacturers not to actively sell Intel-based servers--IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer, for instance, all include them in their lineups. However, Fujitsu has previously embraced Intel in other areas of its business, such as its PC operation. Sun, a bitter rival of Intel, has sold low-cost servers containing processors from Intel or Advanced Micro Devices for years, but it does not emphasize them. In addition, Sun released a version of Solaris 9 for Intel servers, which it killed last year but then revived after customers objected. Cray, the supercomputing pioneer that sells equipment to Sandia National Laboratories and other scientific customers, remains one of the few companies not selling any Intel-based computers. As for the Linux collaboration between Fujitsu and Intel, more than 300 Fujitsu engineers will be placed in a new Linux division formed for the joint effort. Much of the joint Linux work will focus on improving reliability and manageability on multiprocessing systems. "While some people say Linux is already there, some others believe improvements need to be made," said Richard Dracott, senior director of Intel's enterprise marketing group.
2004-09-20 - Sun's fighting chance  Sun Microsystems seeks to avoid oblivion by pursuing a simple but powerful strategy. Its plan? Attack Red Hat, use control over the operating system and the platform to disrupt competitors' pricing and business models, out-engineer everybody in the x86 space and use an alliance with Microsoft to fight a common enemy: IBM. Last week in California, I visited two Sun bigwigs: Jonathan Schwartz, president and chief operating officer, and Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO. When Schwartz asked me, "What do you think of Sun?" I gave him an honest answer. "Sun risks becoming the Data General of the decade. The company could easily slide toward becoming a 'zombie'--a lot of cash but no life, staggering and lurching with a fading heartbeat at each step," I said. Schwartz's comeback was, "You're wrong, and here's why." He then laid out the surprisingly simple and cohesive strategy that Sun will follow in pursuit of a recovery. Here it is, in a stripped-down form. Linux is like every other operating system; it's about the foibles, greed, mistakes and engineering prowess (or lack thereof) of one vendor--in this case, Red Hat. Step No. 1: Make the argument that Linux equals Red Hat. Linux has become a social force, with all of the free world supposedly cooperating to create an always improving operating system that is forever cheaper and more valuable than the old versions of Unix. Sun's view is that Linux is nothing more than Red Hat. The operating system is not about world peace and the charitable work of the world's great programmers. It's like every other operating system ever created: It's about the foibles, greed, mistakes and engineering prowess (or lack thereof) of one vendor--in this case, Red Hat. Step No. 2: Belittle Red Hat. By collapsing Linux into Red Hat, Sun now has a clear target. It can hammer away at a company, as opposed to waging the impossible task of fighting a social movement. And according to Sun, Red Hat is a very vulnerable target--a company with limited resources, engineering talent, world coverage and capabilities--with potentially serious intellectual-property issues. When Sun visits billion-dollar companies, it uses an effective line of attack: "You're going to entrust the future of your company to what vendor? A little software player with no proven abilities in the enterprise business? Are you out of your mind?" Step No. 3: Contrast Sun with Red Hat. Sun has been a trusted, pragmatic partner with its customers for decades. It is going to return to those customers and clearly contrast its long-term relationship with newcomer Red Hat. The company is doing this now with its old Wall Street customers. Step No. 4: Play up the OS-plus-platform advantage. Sun is playing a very old game here, but it will play it hard. The company is saying that you cannot be a legitimate, long-term player without controlling and harmonizing the operating system and the platform. You must have control over both to offer easy and cost-effective solutions for your customer. Hewlett-Packard is letting HP-UX die in favor of Red Hat and Windows; IBM is introducing Power systems that don't run AIX; and Dell never had an operating system. Watch for Microsoft and Sun to concoct some tough frontal attacks on IBM, their avowed common enemy. Sun makes the claim that it will be the only vendor with a strong platform--Sparc at the high end, x86 at the low end--that also has a strong operating system to offer with Solaris at the high and low ends. Step No. 5: Disrupt the market with a new pricing model. Sun wants its server pricing to mirror cell phone pricing. When you buy a cell phone, you do two things: One, buy the operating system and the phone together; and two, subscribe to cell services for monthly fees. Sun is pricing the server the same way--get the server for a very low price or potentially no price, and pay for the maintenance and applications (the value imparted) on a subscription basis. Sun believes that this new pricing model will only be possible for a vendor that sells and integrates the operating system and the platform. It can cross-subsidize between the two. Step No. 6: Feature customer choice. Sun has dropped all of its stridency around Unix--it is offering choice at the high end and at the low end. It is offering not only Solaris but also Linux and Windows for the operating system. And it is finally offering x86 via the Opteron chip from Advanced Micro Devices. Step No. 7: Feature engineering. Sun is playing an old game here, too: "My tech is better than yours." It is saying that it will out-engineer not only at the operating-system level with Solaris but also on the hardware front. It is claiming that the new generation of Sparc will have vastly lower power consumption than Itanium and Power while featuring faster throughput and superior multithreading. On the x86 front, Sun is saying that Opteron--AMD's answer to Intel's Itanium--is superior to what Intel has to offer and that, through its long-term engineering experience, it is going to produce x86 products superior to those of Dell, HP and IBM. Sun claims that engineering remains a distinctive competence of the company--a battleground where it can hammer the competition, especially the low- or no-R&D companies like Dell. Step No. 8: Feature the Microsoft-Sun deal. The money flowing from Microsoft to Sun will help. But more importantly, watch for Microsoft and Sun to concoct some tough frontal attacks on IBM, their avowed common enemy. Where the potholes are I'll say this for Sun: Its strategy is simple and to the point. If Sun goes down, it's going to go down taking very big swings. You can criticize the company for many transgressions, but you can't fault it for lacking guts. If it goes down, it's going to go down taking very big swings. Schwartz and McNealy make a good team--brains and will in a tight package. The potential stumbles or counters that I can see are: A fixation on engineering, not price. Dell will eat Sun for breakfast if the latter doesn't trade off engineering perfection for price. Sun has avoided this trap so far. Betrayal by Microsoft. Redmond has been known on a few occasions to play its own self-interest first when it comes to deals. McNealy and Steve Ballmer, his counterpart at Microsoft, are high-emotion cases--their trust and cooperation run the risk of wild up-and-down swings. Linux becoming more than Red Hat. If IBM can keep Linux independent of Red Hat, Sun's target will vastly widen, thus blunting its strategy. And, of course, IBM could always acquire Red Hat, yielding instant credibility. Engineering risks. The strategy depends on some breakthrough original engineering, such as Sun's chip multithreading project. If Sun can't deliver on the big promises, it will suffer. I've hung around with many tech zombies in the past, from Wang Laboratories to Prime Computer to Digital Equipment. When I stare into the eyes of the Sun management team, I still see life; this team doesn't look like it's ready to give up or stop trying to compete. Given the strategy and management, I believe that there is a good chance that Sun will be around for a strong third act.
2002-09-16 - Sun's comeback plan on horizon Sun Microsystems, backed into a corner by competitors and by economics, is launching new projects in an effort to revitalize its diminished computer-industry leadership. Read more about Sun Sun shook up computing giants in the late 1990s with its success in selling heavy-duty networked "server" computers, machines that caught IBM and Hewlett-Packard flat-footed, and with its Java software, a cross-platform programming language that undermined Microsoft's operating system dominance. But Sun's revenue and stock price have plummeted since peaking in 2000, and competitors are circling like sharks. Now, Sun is trying to fight back. Its efforts will determine whether the company ends up relegated to a small niche of high-end computing--the fate that befell Silicon Graphics--or continues its ability to steer the industry with profitable new ideas. Evidence of Sun's comeback plans will emerge this week at the SunNetwork conference in San Francisco. On Wednesday, Sun will detail its strategy to use Linux to attack Microsoft's desktop-computer stronghold, and on Thursday, it will describe its N1 plan to gather servers and storage systems into a single pool of computing power. Some are confident Sun is getting back its game. "I think the pendulum has swung way too far toward the pessimistic side," said Gartner analyst Paul McGucken, who has seen Sun fight back from the brink before. One telling example is that despite two years of sustained troubles, Sun managed to keep HP and IBM from wrenching away its Unix server seller crown, and indeed is recapturing market share. Hatching new plans As it did with Java, Sun is once again finding a way to benefit from disgruntlement over Microsoft's dominance. It spawned the Liberty Alliance Project to let Web surfers and site operators forgo Microsoft's Passport authentication system and still enjoy enter-data-once, jump-from-site-to-site usability. Sun quickly lined up Liberty support from many prestigious companies--including United Airlines, General Motors, Fidelity Investments, Visa, Bank of America, Nokia, Cisco Systems, Sprint and Vodafone. Now Sun is talking about why partners flocked to Liberty: They were the ones who suggested the project in the first place. "Visa called us and told us to do it," McNealy said in a recent interview. Sun says it is working on a sequel to Liberty, though it's being cagey with the details. This time the anti-Microsoft angle is in digital rights management, the mechanism that controls the copying and use of proprietary data such as music or video files. Microsoft has its own digital rights management features built into Windows. "We've seen a lot of success with Liberty and have been in touch with the media industry about developing a platform-, content-, vendor-neutral standard like Liberty," Jonathan Schwartz, Sun's executive vice president for software, told CNET News.com. Sun is more prepared to talk about its Linux desktop effort. At least initially, the campaign will be directed not at the millions of average computer users but at corporations that dictate what software employees will use--for example, call centers with hundreds of telephone operators, Schwartz said. Sun employees themselves will use Linux desktops. But Sun has tried before, with little success, to penetrate this market. It failed to encourage much adoption of "thin clients" such as its Sun Ray products that rely on a central server to do most processing tasks. The N1 plan to link servers and storage devices is closer to Sun's areas of expertise and its traditional customer base that uses expensive, crash-resistant hardware. HP's Utility Data Center and IBM's "eLiza" autonomic computing initiatives have similarities to N1, but Sun hopes to make its effort stand out through its existing relationships with other computing companies. To make N1 a reality, according to a source familiar with the plan, Sun is working on partnerships with networking giant Cisco Systems; software companies such as Oracle, i2, BMC, PeopleSoft and SAP; and "system integrators" such as Cap Gemini Ernst & Young that build customer computer systems. Sun declined to comment on the partnerships. The pressure is on The pessimism about Sun isn't groundless. The biggest strain on Sun's business today is diminished profit margins. In its most recent quarter, $3.4 billion in revenue carried the company temporarily back into profitability, but Sun's margins declined where it had led analysts to believe they would increase. Without profits, Sun can't afford the research and development efforts needed to keep its in-house designs competitive with those produced by IBM's legions of engineers and with those stemming from the Intel-Microsoft alliance. Investor skepticism is deep: Sun's stock closed Friday at $3.11, its lowest price since 1996. "In today's world, Microsoft has a viable product out there that competes." --George Narr, chief information officer, PolyMedica There are internal challenges. Sun is rebuilding the executive suite to accommodate the departure of Chief Operating Officer Ed Zander and other longtime executives. And the company has laid off 3,900 starting in 2001 and is cutting another 1,000 positions by the end of 2002. But most of the threat comes from outside Sun--chiefly from the software power of Microsoft and the hardware power of IBM, Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard. Intel servers and the Windows and Linux operating systems that commonly run on those systems are steadily encroaching on Sun's turf. PolyMedica subsidiary Liberty Medical, which supplies diabetic and respiratory care supplies, happily uses Windows. It's using 16-processor Unisys Windows servers for order processing and for monitoring information such as how many orders have been shipped in a given period of time, PolyMedica CIO George Narr said. "If I were a huge billion-dollar corporation five years ago, Sun would be the way to go. In today's world, Microsoft has a viable product out there that competes," Narr said. Use of SAP's business and accounting software is a particular Microsoft stronghold for penetrating high-end businesses. A Verizon call center running SAP servers is in the top 5 percent in terms of users tapping into Windows software, said Bill Veighte, corporate vice president of Microsoft's Windows Server Group. The Windows stakes are higher now with the arrival of Intel's Itanium chip. It was years late and a hard sell because it requires that software written for Pentium or Xeon processors be reworked to run well on Itanium. But the new chip, with its eventual ability to address more than a billion times more memory than most of today's high-end servers, is a serious contender. Intel also can use the technology developed for manufacturing its mainstream processors to lower the cost of its Itanium line. The second-generation Itanium 2 successor is showing some promise after its predecessor flopped. A warning shot across Sun's bow was the announcement last week that an NEC server with 32 Itanium 2 processors running Windows .Net Server 2003 and Microsoft's SQL Server database achieved the fifth-highest ranking to date on a high-end server speed test. Windows still lags But there's more to persuading customers than raw performance. Microsoft needs to improve Windows' ability to split different jobs into different domains, as well as its support for coping with hardware failures without crashing. "We're running our business here. Right now all that is Unix. It serves us well." --Ed Toban, chief information officer, Colgate-Palmolive "They're really at the beginning of dealing with that," said First Albany securities analyst Walter Winnitzki. "It's been done for decades with mainframes and is becoming well established in Unix, but you're barely scratching the surface for Windows-Intel systems for doing that." Windows isn't yet up to high-end tasks, agrees Colgate-Palmolive Chief Information Officer Ed Toban, who leads an IT staff of 900 and who recently switched global business operations from Sun Unix servers to IBM Unix servers. "We're running our business here. Right now all that is Unix. It serves us well," Toban said. "If you're stepping out of the traditional data center and talking about Internet servers, then you can open that view a little bit." And Sun's customer loyalty counts, too. Questerra uses Sun servers and storage for its 80-person company that sells geographic analysis services for insurance companies and others. "A lot of our developers have deep Sun background," said area vice president Patrick Kurks. Desert Sky Software, which has used servers from numerous companies and which hosts servers running Sandia National Laboratories projects, refuses to use Windows after earlier projects left a bad taste in its mouth. "Until I have seen something that would suggest the issues I had with them have changed, I would not" consider Microsoft, Desert Sky President Luke Holton said. IBM, though, unlike Microsoft in this area with Windows, has experience in spades with huge customers, and it's managed, with Unix servers based on its Power4 processor, to win back much of the respect it lost over the years. "Power4 from IBM hit its mark, unlike (Sun's) UltraSparc III, which was at least a year late," said Kevin Krewell, senior editor of the Microprocessor Report industry newsletter. "IBM is coming on vastly strong," Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice said. And while Sun ridicules IBM's Global Services division as an army of money-sucking consultants, "IGS is big and successful for a reason: Many customers want someone else to be responsible for parts of information technology," he said. But IBM hasn't dethroned Sun. Ups and downs Sun has begun recovering sales lost to IBM in 2001. During the Internet years, Sun's success drove its market share ever closer to IBM's, for years the company with the most server sales. In the first quarter of 2002, just as the Internet mania began to collapse, Sun had 18 percent market share to IBM's 21 percent, according to research firm IDC. The surge was especially remarkable given some of the lows Sun experienced earlier in the decade. In the mid-1990s, Sun servers "were not very well designed, and Windows was becoming more of a competitive threat on the server," McGucken said. Sun found its escape buying a 64-processor server from Cray that vaulted Sun from the periphery to data center accounts at the heart of corporate computing operations. But IBM aggression, along with sales of used Sun equipment and a slow transition to new UltraSparc III-based Sun servers, hit Sun hard. In the second half 2001, its share slipped to less than 12 percent while IBM's grew past 34 percent. In 2002, though, Sun has reversed those losses, reaching 17 percent share in the second quarter with sales of $1.7 billion, third place after $2.9 billion for IBM and $2.9 billion for the combined HP-Compaq, IDC said. Sun will have to keep its products competitive if it is to sustain its current recovery, though. "The pressures on Sun, which will be significant, will take two to three years to become serious even if Sun does not react," Giga Information Group analyst Richard Fichera said in a report this month. Eventually, however, Linux and Intel-based servers could erode Sun profit margins. Along the way, Fichera believes, Sun will have to survive by becoming a software company that relies on others' hardware. "We fully expect that at some point in the not-too-distant future, regardless of continuing improvements to its underlying Sparc processor technology, Sun will be forced to consider incorporating its proven intellectual property...into Intel-based systems," Fichera said. But the fact remains that, for now, Sun remains top dog in the Unix server category--the biggest slice of the overall server market--despite intense discounts and strong technology from IBM. "IBM threw everything at us," said Robert Youngjohns, Sun's new executive vice president of sales. "But we're still here."
2000-11-27 - Sun's brash Zander talks tough against competitors Sun Microsystems chief operating officer Ed Zander may not be as outspoken as his boss, Scott McNealy, but he's a close second. Zander, who has been with Sun since 1987, has seen the company claw its way from a seller of niche Unix workstations to a powerhouse of the computing landscape. By selling ever-increasing numbers of powerful and profitable server computers--the brains of the Internet and of corporate networks--Sun has put Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Intel on the defensive. In doing so, though, Sun has stepped on more than a few toes. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company has run into trouble trying to spread its Java software as widely as possible while simultaneously maintaining some control. It's also roused the wrath of Intel, which accused Sun of not working hard enough to get Sun's Solaris operating system working on Intel's upcoming high-end Itanium processors. But Zander is unapologetic. In a wide-ranging interview with News.com, he took on Intel, Microsoft, and even the Linux movement that so many companies work hard to curry favor with. CNET News.com: A lot of people call Java proprietary to a certain degree. Zander: Bah! Java will go down, 10 to 20 years from now, as the most open, standard language and software environment that has hit our industry as long as I've been around. Here it is four and a half years later, we've got 2.5 million programmers in Java, we've got every educational institution and high school teaching children (Java). I don't get a dime for this stuff. You have these guys--GM and Ford and BMW and Motorola...and Nokia and Symbian and Mastercard and Visa--all doing Java without anything to do with Sun, other than to give us a call every once in awhile to ask us technical questions. What makes it so incredibly interesting and why Microsoft gets so bent about it is the fact that...once I say I'm writing a Java application, I can run it on (any Java-enabled) device. It seems that's conformance to Java functioning, not Java branding. No, because at the end of the day, what makes a McDonald's french fry is there is a spec and you have to conform to it. And what makes Solaris (Sun's version of the Unix operating system) Solaris, and why I have the market position we have today, is because there is one Solaris. So you have a spec and a conformance to a brand. It's so important to the Java brand that we maintain it. If you're going to build a Java virtual machine, we only ask you to...pass the conformance. And that's what Microsoft didn't want to do. Microsoft wanted--this is so clear and simple--they wanted to take the spec and add extensions and still call it Java. Outside of three companies--HP and Microsoft and depending on what day of the week it is, IBM--nobody complains about Java. Sun software evangelist George Paolini was talking about eventually open-sourcing it. We would love to some day. At what point? When we think innovation has happened to the point where we have pervasiveness. And even with open source, if you're going to use the Java brand, you passed the conformance test. The thing with Linux today--I call it the bathtub. I can throw source in there. It's all floating around and it's available to everybody. But I as a vendor can take anything I want out of that bathtub and call it Linux. Now if you think that's going to work for application developers, call me in a year or two when IBM's Linux is different than HP's Linux is different than Dell's Linux and (a customer) will have to recompile five times. You've broken it effectively. So you cannot depend on one Linux. It still seems like there's some uncertainty about where software fits in at Sun. I think we haven't marketed well. I think where the problem is we always live with this hardware overhang. It's hard to get the press and the analysts to understand how important it is inside the company. We've got more software programmers than hardware programmers inside the company. We've got some really good substance here. It's Java; it's the tools that we've been collecting under Forte and NetBeans that we haven't done a good job in marketing; it's the iPlanet strategy; and it's Solaris. Why is Sun so interested in bringing Solaris to Itanium? Here it is nine years later since I did some Intel deal and people still doubt our intention. We realized there were two platforms back in 1990 that were going to survive. One was Intel; that was easy to pick. The other one was (Sun's) Sparc. People didn't believe us. There is today a huge business for Sparc applications and there's a huge business for Intel. So we ported Solaris to Intel. We spent years and tens of millions of dollars, if not more, converting the source base, and nearly crippled Sun back in '92 and '93 doing that. Today we have one source base and we compile twice (once for Intel and once for Sparc chips). We entered into a deal with Intel several years ago to do Itanium. We did it and they reneged. I think they just didn't deliver on their commitments. They're confusing the success of Sun in the marketplace with the Solaris-on-Itanium port, and they don't realize that their success in the marketplace is (tied to) Solaris. So if anything, if I was them, I would embrace Solaris tonight on Itanium and market it to Compaq and Dell and HP and everybody else. So who needs the other partner more? Do you need Intel more than they need Solaris? We don't need anybody (now). In the industry five years ago, seven years ago...I don't think Intel needed us; we needed them. Sparc did not have the breadth and application base. Today we are growing at 30 to 40 percent a year. And applications are coming over here in droves. How has the collapse of the dot-com euphoria affected Sun? I never thought Toothpaste.com was going to make Sun. We did know that working with the optical companies and the Internet infrastructure companies and the Inktomis and the portals was going to drive a lot of this. Plus we also knew when we talked to a GM and a GE and a Citibank and a Gap and a Wal-Mart that they were going to re-architect their supply chains and business processes and customer service stuff. That's where the money was going to be made in this whole dot-com area--that they were going to dot-com themselves like Sun was. But it was great to say, "We're the dot in dot-com," because it got everybody focused on Sun being an Internet infrastructure supplier. I figured there might have been a shakeout at some time, but we had a very small part of our business in that anyway. Don't confuse AOL with a new dot-com company. I look at AOL and eBay, I look at Exodus, I look at Digix--these guys are going to be players for a while. I'm curious about the Sun-AOL iPlanet software suite. Most of iPlanet is now run by Sun folks. You said 800 out of 2,500 iPlanet folks are AOL employees. What's the future direction for that? Is that going to become an all-Sun shop at some point? We may of course see more and more Sun personnel building these products because that's our area of expertise. But you're going to see (Sun) working closely with AOL on understanding the end-to-end architectures--how iPlanet technology can benefit AOL. And we'll be working on even things around Java and appliances that are outside of iPlanet but things we can do with AOL. We like the relationship. I can't tell you the intangible benefits we've gotten here at Sun understanding a consumer portal company that deals with 30 million subscribers. There's a ton of stuff we sold to them. I don't know the numbers. And then of course the doors have opened up to us because I think the combination of the two brought us into (new) accounts. We got a ton of server business that maybe we wouldn't have gotten. What's changed in your job since you were promoted in April 1999, becoming president as well as chief operating officer? Probably the only change that has really been hard for me is most of my role as COO goes to produce the (revenue and profit) numbers, to make the (new) products. The president's role has got me more external. Dealing with the customers, dealing with strategic relationships, dealing with some of our partners has helped take a load off Scott to come in to the companies and close the deals. You've said that by the end of this year, about half of Sun employees will have less than two years' seniority with the company. Scaling the company is probably Scott's and my biggest challenge right now. You realize as executives that it's probably more (a problem) than any competitor. It's your biggest challenge. How do you assimilate, train, (teach the Sun) culture?
2005-10-10 - Sun upgrading high-end Unix servers in November    Sun Microsystems plans to begin the second phase of its change to its new UltraSparc IV+ processor on Nov. 8, bringing the chip to its high-end Unix servers, CNET News.com has learned. The UltraSparc IV+ processor significantly increases server performance, compared with its predecessor, the UltraSparc IV. Sun introduced the new chip in its midrange Unix servers--models with between four and 24 processors--in September. Sun will bring the new chip to standard configurations of its top-end 36-processor Sun Fire E20K and 72-processor E25K on Nov. 8, according to a note on the System News Web site. System News partners with Sun Channel Partners and provides Web and newsletter services to Sun Microsystems. Sun declined to comment for this story. Those who are more impatient have another option, too: Starting Tuesday, they can buy the "Uniboard" system boards with UltraSparc IV+ chips. Uniboards with any UltraSparc III, IV and IV+ processors can all be used simultaneously in the same server. The IV and IV+ models have two processing engines, or cores. Those who trade in earlier Uniboards can get discounts of up to 40 percent when buying the new models, Sun said. Performance with the new Uniboards increases 50 percent to 80 percent, compared with UltraSparc IV-based systems, and 200 percent to 250 percent compared with UltraSparc III-based systems, Sun said. The top end of Sun's Sparc server line could use a boost. Merrill Lynch analyst Richard Farmer last week said Sun's most recent quarter had strong sales of midrange models with four, eight and 12 processors but "relative weakness in high-end enterprise servers." The UltraSparc models face competition from IBM's new Power5+, though that processor is only available in lower-end Unix servers from IBM so far. It will see more competition when Intel begins selling its first dual-core Itanium chip, code-named "Montecito." Hewlett-Packard's high-end server line uses Itanium. The UltraSparc IV+, like the Power5+ and Montecito Itanium, employs a manufacturing process with features measuring 90 nanometers, or 90 billionths of a meter. Its predecessors use a 130-nanometer process. The new process enables Sun to add more circuitry to the chip; the company used this expanded "transistor budget" to move formerly separate high-speed cache memory directly onto the chip. Sun has several other Sparc chips in development as the Santa Clara, Calif.-based server and software maker works to keep the once-dominant processor family relevant. In coming months, Sun plans to introduce lower-end servers using the UltraSparc IIIi+ and the more ambitious "Niagara" processor, which has eight cores and can simultaneously execute 32 instruction sequences, called threads. In 2006, Sun plans to begin selling servers using Fujitsu's Sparc64 VI processor in a server family called, for the time being, the Advanced Product Line. Future high-end systems using a Sun-designed chip code-named Rock are due in 2008.
2005-09-19 - Sun unveils new UltraSparc 4 servers   Sun Microsystems on Monday overhauled part of its server computer line with new UltraSparc IV+ microprocessors, seeking to regain some ground lost in the high-end server market to rivals IBM and Hewlett-Packard. As expected, Sun said its new Sun Fire V490, V890, E2900, E4900 and E6900 servers are powered by UltraSparc IV+ processors with a clock speed of 1.5GHz and run Sun's latest version of its Unix operating system, Solaris 10. The servers will also run earlier versions of Solaris. The servers should help the company bide time until high-end servers arrive on the market in 2006 and are the result of a collaboration between Sun and Fujitsu, analysts said. Those servers have been dubbed the APL line, short for Advanced Product Line. "This sort of fills in a gap until the APL systems become available," said analyst Gordon Haff of market research firm Illuminata. "It's a good upgrade for people who are already in the Sparc-Solaris camp." Sun's servers using the Sparc chip run only on Solaris. The chip that will power the APL line is based on Fujitsu's Sparc64 VI chip. Despite calls by analysts after the implosion of the dot-com and telecommunications investment bubbles in late 2000 that hurt Sun more than its rivals, the company continued to invest aggressively in research and development. That investment is paying off, Sun's Chief Executive, Scott McNealy said in a telephone interview. "We kind of listened to our own drummer," McNealy said. These are three- to five-year investments, and we're putting the whole story together the best we know how." Among the markets hit worst in the downturn were telecommunications and financial servers, two key markets for Sun, whose servers were also extremely popular among Internet start-ups during the dot-com boom. Haff said that UltraSparc IV+ machines could help Sun compete more effectively against machines from rival IBM that use Big Blue's top-of-the-line Power5 processor. But the performance of the Sun machines using the UltraSparc IV+ chip may be surpassed by IBM's faster Power5+ that is slated for release later in 2005. "There is an IBM Power5 upgrade coming as well," Haff said. Sun also has in development its line of chips code-named Niagara that will have eight processing cores that in total will be able to handle 32 threads, or instruction sequences, simultaneously. Servers using the Niagara processors are due out in early 2006 or perhaps earlier, Sun has said. "That really is going to be an attempt to change the playing field, at least for a certain class of systems," Haff said of the forthcoming Niagara chips. Sun's UltraSparc chips, in addition to competing against IBM's servers using the Power chip, also compete against Intel's Itanium processor, which is backed by Itanium's co-developer HP. The UltraSparc IV+ servers come after the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company last week introduced new industry-standard servers it said will more than triple the amount of the computer server market it can address. Those servers, named X2100, X4100 and X4200 use Opteron microprocessors--the brains of personal computers--from Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's chief rival in the microprocessor business. Industry-standard servers, also known as x86 servers, are those that use either Intel, AMD or Intel-compatible chips as their data processing engines. Those industry-standard servers from Sun can run either Solaris 10, Microsoft's Windows or commercial versions of the Linux operating system. The new servers are available and prices start at about $31,000, Sun said. Story Copyright 2005 Reuters Limited.All rights reserved.
2001-09-25 - Sun unleashes top-end Starcat servers  Sun challenges IBM with new serverEd Zander, COO, Sun Microsystems Ordinarily, the arrival of what Sun Microsystems calls the most sophisticated product in company history would be a gala affair. But the formal unveiling Tuesday of the top-end Starcat server had the tenor of a memorial service. Sun Chief Executive Scott McNealy donned a dark suit--a rare sight for the typically informal and flamboyant leader--and opened the event with a moment of silence to recognize the death of Sun software executive Phil Rosenzweig, who was on a plane used in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. While the 340 Sun employees who had offices in the World Trade Center all were unharmed, "Our folks were victims, and they saw things they shouldn't have to see," McNealy said, visibly moved and his voice shaking. New York native and Chief Operating Officer Ed Zander said Sun decided on Sept. 14 to move the Starcat unveiling to San Francisco. But on the urging of New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to resume as much business as usual, they decided a few days later to move it back to New York. "Doing a product launch--it seems so out of place," Zander said after seeing the New York devastation firsthand. But Sun launched the product, heading back to more familiar territory of criticizing competitors. McNealy called IBM's upcoming high-end Regatta server "Regretta" and Microsoft's grand .Net software strategy a "hair ball." "Rudy said, 'Come do what you do,' and, well, this is what I do, gang," McNealy said, drawing applause and cheers. As reported, Starcat--officially called the Sun Fire 15K--is Sun's new top-end server, with prices starting at $1.4 million and heading north of $10 million for high-end configurations. The server can accommodate as many as 106 processors and up to 576GB of memory, though most business customers aren't expected to use more than 72 processors. Sun is positioning the machine as a replacement for IBM mainframes and for groups of lesser servers that require more administrators. "This is probably as significant a product and technology announcement as anything we've done in 18 years," Zander said. "We are really narrowing the gap with the mainframe and are in fact surpassing the mainframe on several fronts," added Shahin Khan, head of server marketing. Starcat, which arrived months later than originally scheduled, is important for several reasons besides mere sales revenue. For one, high-end server spending is multiplied by accompanying purchases of services, support, storage and software. Unix servers are the biggest part of the server market, accounting for about $29 billion of the $60 billion overall server market in 2000, according to market research firm IDC. Servers are the powerful computers used to handle network tasks such as recording credit card transactions, hosting Web sites or recording corporate finances. On a more abstract level, a company's future is judged by its technological prowess, and right now many are wondering how well Sun's designs will stack up against servers built around Intel's still-nascent Itanium chip and IBM's Power4 chip. Fallout from attacks The Sept. 11 attacks cast a pall over Sun's financial prospects as well. "We always count on a big September" to compensate for slower sales in the vacation-heavy months of July and August, McNealy said. "It was not helpful economically to have basically the week the U.S. economy stood still." The attacks came after an already dark economy with slowing server spending. "There's no question the telcos invested like crazy" and now have more computing power than they need, McNealy said. "The dot-coms aren't around and are reselling a lot of equipment in the gray market, and the financial services world backed off big time as their transaction rates" decreased. Sun, whose sales ballooned during the go-go Internet years and plunged when the bubble burst, now is emphasizing larger, more established customers in health care, energy, defense, manufacturing and intelligence. "Information technology is a discretionary item in the short run, optional in the mid-range. Long-term, it's mandatory," McNealy said. Simplicity vs. complexity? Sun said it will emphasize its message of simplicity when taking on IBM. Where software can run unmodified on the vast majority of Sun's servers, IBM customers are forced to pay Big Blue to deal with its hodgepodge of server chips, operating systems and software. But complexity is the norm for the customers that buy high-end systems such as the Starcat, said Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice. "Customers like Sun's simplicity," Eunice said, but a complicated product portfolio can also mean a versatile portfolio. "When you start saying simplicity, there's a risk that...you're not really Sun sheds light on rebuild effort in NYCScott McNealy, CEO, Sun Microsystems using the right tool for the job. I think that's a risk that the simplicity argument runs in large, complicated enterprises." At the unveiling, Sun demonstrated several high-end abilities of the Starcat. Topping the list was partitioning, a hardware and software feature that lets a customer divide a single Starcat into several independent computers. Sun first introduced its partitioning abilities in 1997 with Starcat's predecessor, the 64-processor E10000 "Starfire" system, which Sun will continue to sell for a year to a year and a half. Partitioning, a feature available for years on IBM mainframes, is relatively rare in Unix servers. Hewlett-Packard, the second-largest Unix server seller after Sun, debuted partitioning with its Superdome server that went on sale in January, and IBM will debut its Unix server partitioning abilities with its Regatta server. Cheaper by the pair But IBM's approach, which uses virtual software partitions instead of Sun's more hardware-based designs, has some advantages over Sun's technology, including the ability to make partitions smaller than the four-processor minimum the Sun design permits, Eunice said. With some jobs requiring less processing power and Oracle charging about $30,000 to $40,000 per CPU to run its database software, it can be good to have partitions of one or two processors, he said. Sun also demonstrated Starcat's ability to withstand hardware failures or changes without being shut down, running a job unfazed while several processor boards, input-output boards and a control board were removed. This "hot-swap" ability is indeed an advantage over current IBM servers as well as the upcoming Regatta, Eunice said. But in the big picture, the years when Sun could expect a vast lead over Unix server competitors are a thing of the past. "You can argue over individual features and functions of Regatta and Starcat until the cows come home," Eunice said. The real thing here is that Sun has not had a lot of competition" for top-end Unix servers of near-mainframe power. "Now they've got at least two big competitors, HP and IBM."
2003-10-10 - Sun to release Solaris for AMD's Opteron   SAN FRANCISCO--Sun Microsystems' Solaris will become the third mainstream operating system to take advantage of Advanced Micro Devices' 64-bit Opteron processor. Solaris, Sun's version of Unix, already runs on 32-bit "x86" processors including AMD's Athlon and Intel's Xeon. But Sun also will release a version in 2004 that will take advantage of the 64-bit extensions that make Opteron different from those other chips, Sun software chief Jonathan Schwartz told reporters in a meeting here Thursday. Sun made the decision because of the speed that software shows on Opteron, Schwartz said. "It is highly performant on the systems we've looked at now," he said. A test version of Solaris for Opteron is scheduled to arrive in the first quarter of 2004, with the final version later in the year, Schwartz said. SuSE Linux has a 64-bit version of Linux that runs on Opteron; Red Hat plans to release one this month; and Microsoft will release a version of Windows for the chip in 2004. In addition, NetBSD and FreeBSD, two versions of the BSD variant of Unix, support Opteron's 64-bit features. A third, OpenBSD, plans support later, project leader Theo de Raadt said. Running Solaris on Opteron will solidify the relationship between Sun and AMD, but won't change the big picture, said Enterprise Application Group analyst William Hurley. "The movement is Linux, the platform is Intel. That's the direction we see things going," Hurley said. "I don't believe the 64-bit world is something we're going to see in the next 24 months." Chips with 64-bit features are able to address vastly larger amounts of memory than 32-bit processors. Where Intel's Itanium uses dramatically different software than its Pentium or Xeon, AMD's Opteron and Athlon 64 are extensions that can easily run today's 32-bit software. The difficulty in running older Pentium software on Itanium has made it harder for Intel to build an ecosystem of software for the new chip. Intel hopes to bridge the gap with software called the IA-32 Execution Layer that will let x86 software run on Itanium. Software rising at Sun Software is gaining in importance at Sun, which hopes to use to prop up server profit margins drastically eroded by reawakened IBM and by increasingly powerful Intel-based systems from companies such as Dell. Profit margins are inherently better for software than hardware because once software is made, it can be sold over and over. "There's no cost of goods," Schwartz said. Sun has tried for years to improve its software work, usually without much success. Its latest attempt is the Java Enterprise System, a broad collection of server software for which Sun charges a customer $100 per year per employee, and the Java Desktop System, desktop software for which Sun charges $50 per year per employee. Sun has set up sales incentives that to push software aggressively. As of July 1, "The software folks are making three to five times their hardware brethren on the same sale," Schwartz said, meaning that a software salesperson could earn the same commission on a $200,000 sale that a hardware salesperson would make on a $1 million sale. In addition, 20 percent of sales managers' compensation is based on software sales, Schwartz added. The Java Enterprise System also can tow along other revenue, including services, Schwartz said. The first priority will be offering customers help migrating from IBM WebSphere to the Sun software, and the second will be help switching from Microsoft Exchange, he said. Sun vs. Merrill Lynch Schwartz also criticized some of a scathing open letter by Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Milunovich last week, who advised among other things that Sun drop its Java Desktop System, code-named Mad Hatter, and its Java software. Java is an inextricable part of Sun, as impossible to remove as Internet technologies, Schwartz said. And with Mad Hatter, Sun is getting ahead of "commoditization" trends that have hurt the company before as mainstream technology such as Intel processors eats into Sun's high-end market share. "At $50 a desktop, we will commoditize the entire desktop," Schwartz said of the Mad Hatter initiative. Sun's StarOffice software, a competitor to Microsoft Office, also is catching on, particularly with governments in Europe, he said. "We have two 20,000-unit StarOffice deployments this quarter," he said, though declining to name the customers. And Schwartz had criticisms of his own for the analyst. "Mr. Milunovich is a fan of theatrics," Schwartz said, and he'd profit from hearing Sun's point of view in detail. "I wish he'd attend our analyst conferences."
2005-01-25 - Sun to release first OpenSolaris tidbit Tuesday    Sun Microsystems will begin releasing its Solaris operating system as open-source software on Tuesday, starting with a new performance analysis and debugging tool called Dynamic Tracing. "DTrace" is one of Sun's most loudly touted new features in version 10 of Solaris. Although the operating system will be available by the end of January, those wanting to see the full source code under the OpenSolaris plan will have to wait until the second quarter of 2005, a Sun representative said Monday. Sun's OpenSolaris plan--to be formally unveiled Tuesday, along with legal details, the OpenSolaris.org Web site and a new community advisory board--is an attempt to steal some of the thunder of Linux, a project that unlike Solaris was open-source software from its earliest days. In another part of its Linux assault, Sun will make Solaris 10 available at no cost, a contrast to the practice of top Linux seller Red Hat, which requires payment for use of its Enterprise Linux. Sun had hoped to launch OpenSolaris in 2004, but it was held up by licensing discussions with companies, Sun executives have said. "The long and short of it is that going through the 5 to 10 million lines of code that is Solaris and making sure everything is ready to go takes a long time," said Tom Goguen, Sun's director of Solaris marketing, in a Monday interview. "We want to drive to get the whole thing on the Web starting sometime next quarter." Sun representatives will hold two of the five positions on the OpenSolaris advisory board, Goguen said. The Sun minority will share power with two outside members of the OpenSolaris pilot project--elected by others in the project--and a representative of the broader open-source community, he said. The board members will probably be named by March, Goguen added. Solaris--the software as sold and supported by Sun--will be a carefully tested and certified subset of OpenSolaris, Goguen said. It's not clear yet what mechanism will determine which code contributions are accepted into OpenSolaris, but Goguen said Sun would like a large group to control the approval process, as happens with Solaris itself. Also on Monday, Sun confirmed plans to use the Community Development and Distribution License, a move first reported by CNET News.com. The license precludes programmers from intermingling Solaris and Linux software but does permit swapping with projects under several other open-source licenses. "We are going to be doing OpenSolaris under the CDDL, and as a sign of how serious we are, we packaged up DTrace source code and made that available under the CDDL," Goguen said. Rivals have responded differently to the arrival of Linux. Hewlett-Packard and IBM, the No. 2 and No. 3 sellers of Unix servers after Sun, embraced the operating system years before Sun and did so with more enthusiasm. IBM and HP see Linux as a way to advance their favored processor designs--IBM's Power and Intel's Itanium, respectively. And Dell, which is a growing power in the market for servers using x86 processors such as Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron, considered supporting Solaris in 1999 before settling unequivocally on Linux for its Unix-like option. Sun said it spent more than $500 million in development to upgrade Solaris 9 into Solaris 10. The company has more than 1,000 Solaris programming engineers, Goguen said. DTrace can be used to pick apart software as it runs, finding and tracking what processes are being requested by what programs. Unlike some probe technology, which requires a special version of the operating system, support for DTrace is included in the standard Solaris kernel. "DTrace is a facility in Solaris 10 that dynamically instruments the kernel, dynamically instruments the applications, and weaves it together in real time," Bryan Cantrill, one of the programmers behind the software, said during a November presentation. Cantrill said he used a DTrace prototype to diagnose a performance problem on a Sun server in 2002. "This is a machine that had 3,400 processes. But six knuckleheaded processes were bringing this system to its knees. Before DTrace, you didn't have a chance in hell of discovering this," he said. DTrace is the favorite Solaris 10 feature of Sun programmer Alan DuBoff, one of the "Secret Six" who urged the company to reverse its 2002 decision to all but cancel the version of Solaris for x86 servers. Sun hired DuBoff in 2003. Some software companies expressed concern that DTrace could let customers find out where those companies' software was inferior. There's some truth to that, DuBoff said, but he pointed out that the software subjects Sun to the exact same scrutiny. "DTrace is like being in a nudist colony," DuBoff said. "There are no secrets--not even for Solaris." But DTrace is the only thing open-source programmers will be permitted to see for the time being. One of the troubles in releasing the Solaris source code has been getting rights to as much of the code as possible. Initially, Sun thought the sticking point would be with the Unix code originally licensed from AT&T, but in fact rights also had to be obtained from companies such as LSI Logic, DuBoff said. "A lot of the code didn't have specific copyrights. It was taking time figuring out where it came from," he said. DTrace is one of several features coming with the new version, including containers that let a single server appear to be several independent ones; predictive self-healing, which finds and sidesteps hardware problems; faster networking; more detailed permission controls that restrict administrators to having only the privileges they require; and support for 64-bit x86 processors. Coming in later updates to Solaris will be the ZFS file system, designed to bring greater reliability to the process of organizing data on storage systems, and the Linux Application Environment, code-named Janus, which lets Red Hat Linux software run without modification on Solaris x86.
2002-06-25 - Sun to push UltraSparc V past 3GHz Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc V, two generations out from the newly introduced processor at the heart of the company's servers, will debut at 1.8GHz and extend past 3GHz, the company is expected to disclose Tuesday. Facing the imminent arrival of Intel's Itanium 2 processor, Sun is taking the offensive by letting David Yen, general manager of Sun's Processor Products Group, uncloak some of the company's plans Tuesday. These future-looking "road maps" are a key part of computing companies' efforts to convince customers, software companies, industry analysts and others that a company such as Sun has strong product plans. According to a presentation Yen is expected to make Tuesday, the UltraSparc III will reach 1.2GHz, a smidgen faster than the 1.05GHz products expected soon from Sun. UltraSparc IV then will debut at 1.2GHz and run to 2GHz. Sun didn't release a schedule for the improvements. The UltraSparc V, designed to have a dual personality to handle different types of workloads, is set to debut at 1.8GHz and run beyond 3GHz. Sun's current UltraSparc III processors arrived much more slowly than the company had hoped, with consequent delays for the UltraSparc IV and V successors. But Sun's servers remain on top of the Unix server market, ample amounts of high-end software is written for them, and the company's profit margins are edging up as the retirement of most older UltraSparc II servers simplifies manufacturing and inventory. Although it's about to add servers based on Intel processors to its stable, Sun is a staunch advocate of its UltraSparc processors, the single most important component of its multibillion-dollar business selling high-powered computers. Sun has more than 1,400 designers working on its Sparc processors. Though Sun systems lead the Unix server market, UltraSparc processors aren't tops in performance. "I don't think Sun sells on the basis of performance," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. "The key issue for Intel is that Sun has such a substantial share of the market that Sun is a safe choice" for software companies deciding which processors to support. Intel, which always has been a leader in the race for faster processor clock rates, rose to its current status selling PCs but is increasingly emphasizing server and networking gear chips. Compared with PCs, those higher-performance systems have more discriminating buyers who recognize there's more to overall system performance than chip clock speed, including factors such as how fast data can be transferred within the system and how many instructions a chip can execute in a single tick of its clock. But Intel, with the NetBurst design in its Pentium 4 processors and their close Xeon relatives for servers, has emphasized clock speed more than ever. The company's argument is that NetBurst lays a foundation for steady clock speed advancement that frees designers to improve performance in other areas. Xeons for dual-processor workstations run today at 2.4GHz, while multiprocessor models top out at 1.6GHz. Sun also is working on lesser but still important chips than the flagship UltraSparc III, IV and V. For higher-end systems that ship in larger quantities than top-end products, Sun plans to introduce soon the UltraSparc IIIi at 1.1GHz and growing to 1.6GHz. Its successor will be the UltraSparc IVi, running from 1.1GHz to 2GHz. For lower-end "horizontal" systems that typically are bought in even larger quantities but don't cost as much, Sun will sell the UltraSparc IIIi from 1.1GHz to 1.4GHz before phasing in a "next generation" i series processor running from 1.5GHz to beyond 3GHz. The UltraSparc II line will live on longest in the "e" line of processors, used in Sun's slimmest servers and low-end workstations. The present 700MHz IIe will eventually be replaced by other IIe chips running at 900MHz to 1.1GHz, at which point next-generation "e" line products will be phased in running at speeds between 1GHz and 2GHz. Though Sun aims products such as its new four-processor V480 "Cherrystone" at Intel servers, much of its competition comes from IBM and Hewlett-Packard Unix servers. IBM's p630, to be introduced Tuesday, brings its Power4 processor to comparatively inexpensive systems costing a well under $50,000. HP, long the leader in midrange Unix servers, is hoping its partnership with Intel on Itanium systems will give it a major cost advantage over the likes of Sun. Texas Instruments builds the UltraSparc processors Sun designs.
2002-06-04 - Sun to launch new low-end servers  Sun Microsystems will launch two new low-end servers Tuesday that use an upgraded UltraSparc IIi processor--systems that will compete with future Sun servers that will employ chips from Sun rival Intel. The 1.75-inch-thick Sun Fire V120 and the Netra 120, to be announced Tuesday at the Supercomm show in Atlanta for telecommunications companies, employ Sun's UltraSparc IIi processor, an improvement over the UltraSparc IIe that powers the lesser V100 model. The V100 reinforced Sun's presence in the market for sub-$1,000 servers, a price range where Intel machines dominate. With its improved processor and significant new administration features, the V120, though, will cost a minimum of $2,495, with useful configurations likely priced higher. Sun, a server specialist, faces increasing competition from Dell Computer, Hewlett-Packard and IBM in lower-end servers built around Intel processors. "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em," Sun decided, announcing plans to sell low-end servers with Intel or Intel-compatible processors and the Linux operating system. It's better to cannibalize one's own sales than to lose them to other companies, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company reasoned. The Netra 120 is similar to the V100, but it's designed to meet the rigorous Network Equipment Building System (NEBS) standards that guarantee a computer will work during fires or freezing temperatures and can run off telecommunication companies' gigantic batteries to protect against power failure. HP, IBM and others are aligning behind an effort to push Linux computers into telecommunications markets. Until Sun's Linux push began, that would have been a more significant threat, but Sun still has work to do in getting its version of Linux ready and reworking its vision to build its entire product line around its UltraSparc processors and Solaris operating system. The V120 and Netra 120 both come with software and an integrated management card with its own network connection that allows system administrators to manage the servers more easily, Sun said. The products let the server's identity be transferred to another if it crashes and lets administrators control the system remotely from a central console. The servers also include with Sun Open Network Environment (Sun ONE) software for hosting Web sites, Sun said. The V120 supports 4GB of memory to the V100's 2GB, and it comes with 36GB hard drives instead of 18GB. The V120 comes with a 550MHz or 650MHz UltraSparc IIi compared with the V100's 500MHz UltraSparc IIe. The new processors also come with 512k of high-speed "cache" memory, compared to 256k on the V100. Customers for the V120 include the U.S. Army, which is using the server in its next-generation Tactical Operations Center, used to support mobile military operations, Sun said. And Nortel Networks bought Netra 120 products to support some mobile phone operations. The new products also support an add-in card that speeds up Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypted communications, the type that commonly secures transactions such as credit card payments over the Web. Low-end servers are often used to connect to people's Web browsers, and accelerated encryption lets computer administrators wring more performance out of a server because it unburdens the computer's main processor. Intel promises its Itanium line of processors will allow Intel-based servers to break competitors' SSL speed records--even those with accelerator cards. For the time being, though, the Itanium's relatively untested new software has hobbled the processor's spread.
2004-02-11 - Sun to buy Opteron server maker reclaim co-founder SAN FRANCISCO--Sun Microsystems has agreed to acquire Kealia, a start-up that designs servers with Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron processor and that employs Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. "We have been working on a bunch of next-generation Opteron servers that seem like a really good fit for Sun," Bechtolsheim said at an analyst conference here Tuesday. Sun Chief Executive and fellow co-founder Scott McNealy greeted Bechtolsheim, saying he could reclaim his employee No. 1 status and praising the engineer's design skills. Sun's co-founder returns to the foldScott McNealy, CEO, Sun Microsystems "He's the most prolific and exciting and talented workstation and single-board computer designer on the planet," McNealy said. "With this guy...designing Opteron servers, there ain't going to be nobody who has the class and breadth of computers we have." Sun for years sold only its own UltraSparc-based computers, but the company has accepted "x86" chips such as Intel's Xeon and AMD's Opteron into its product lines. Now, it's using Opteron to lead its x86 charge in an attempt to catch up to x86 stalwarts IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Dell. Sun announced its first Opteron model, the dual-processor V20z, on Tuesday, and said it plans a four-processor system in the next quarter. The existing systems, however, aren't based on Kealia's technology, McNealy said. Sun said the acquisition, a stock-for-stock transaction, is expected to close by June but didn't release financial terms. Rehiring Bechtolsheim balances out the departure in 2003 of another Sun founder, Bill Joy, who brought deep Unix experience to the company. The other co-founder is Vinod Khosla, who left the company years earlier. The founders met at Stanford University, and indeed, the company's name derives from the acronym for Stanford University Network. Bechtolsheim left Sun in 1995 to found Granite Systems, a company that networking giant Cisco Systems acquired. He left Cisco in 2003 to join Kealia. Bechtolsheim agrees with Sun's opinion that Intel's Itanium is a dud. "The fundamental flaw here is that the (x86 server customers) didn't want to make a transition to a more expensive proprietary system, even if you call it standard," he said. Sanford Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Bechtolsheim's talent complements Sun's skills, but said he doesn't expect dramatic changes in Sun's plans. "The die has been cast. The strategic choices have been made," he said. The move does send a message, though, said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. "It certainly shows they're bloody serious about Opteron," he said, adding that it's likely Kealia's 59 employees are probably the largest concentration of Opteron specialists outside AMD. Also, to boost Sun's Opteron plans, Sun announced a promotion whereby customers get a free V20z if they buy a five-person license to use Sun's x86 version of its Solaris operating system, a development version of its Java Enterprise Server software, and Sun's accompanying development tools. The package costs $1,499 per year for three years. Sun's embrace of Opteron doesn't mean the company is dropping its UltraSparc line. At the conference, McNealy showed two prototype UltraSparc processors built with new manufacturing technology from Texas Instruments, which fabricates Sun's processors. Sun's UltraSparc IIIi and IV are built with circuitry that has features measuring about 130 nanometers, or billionths of a meter, but McNealy showed the UltraSparc IIIi+ and UltraSparc IV+, as McNealy termed the chips, built with a newer 90-nanometer process. Having smaller circuitry means more electronics can be squeezed on a chip and makes it easier to run the chip at higher speeds. The new chips will "approximately double" the performance of their predecessors, McNealy said. The UltraSparc IV+ is code-named Panther, he added.
2002-10-10 - Sun soups up Solaris 9 Sun Microsystems has released the first update of Solaris 9, its new version of the Unix operating system, with a feature to speed up Sun servers and to ensure network performance is up to snuff. Solaris 9 9/02, a name that stems from the product's release date, speeds up memory access with a feature called Memory Placement Optimization to better manage how information is stored in regular memory and on hard disks, Sun said Tuesday. The company claimed the memory technology improvement speeded up computer performance by 12 to 40 percent in some tests. But the technology only benefits Sun's higher-end servers, such as the four-processor Sun Fire 3800 and its more-powerful brethren. Another new feature called IPQoS (Internet Protocol Quality of Service) lets administrators allocate network capacity to different jobs; check networking quality-of-service levels; and charge server customers accordingly. The feature is a part of Sun's "containers" effort to better run different jobs on the same computer and, eventually, across groups of computers linked using Sun's N1 technology. Sun introduced Solaris 9 in May, and Chief Executive Scott McNealy said in August the company has shipped 300,000 copies so far. However, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company will still include Solaris 8 with its servers by default until customers grow more accustomed to the new version. The software is a key part of Sun's effort to stave off attacks from Hewlett-Packard and IBM, each of which covets Sun's position at the top of the Unix server market. IBM has just upgraded its own version of Unix, AIX, while HP is modifying its HP-UX version of the operating system to work with Intel's new Itanium processors. Sun is in the process of restoring full support for Solaris 9 running on Intel-compatible chips such as the Xeon or Advanced Micro Devices' Athlon. Earlier in the year it "deferred productization" of the Intel version. Sun plans to release Solaris updates roughly once per quarter; the next scheduled release is Solaris 9 12/02. Those with software support service agreements get the update for free; others must pay. Price tags range from $249 for a two-processor system to $160,000 for 64-processor system. At the extreme end, it costs $400,000 to upgrade a 128-processor Solaris system such as Fujitsu Technology Solutions' Primepower 2000 or 2500. Beginning with Solaris 9, Sun began bundling with its operating system more packages of higher-level software for jobs such as managing username-password combinations and running business applications written in the server version of Java. With the 9/02 update, Sun is expanding the list of included software, though the additions are only limited editions that may not be used other than for testing and development. Now included are developer versions of the Sun Open Network Environment (Sun ONE) Portal Server, for creating Web sites for groups of people; the Sun ONE Web server, for sending out Web pages; and Sun ONE Studio programming tools.
1999-10-26 - Sun shines Solaris on new Intel chip   Sun's Solaris operating system is running on prototypes of Intel's upcoming 64-bit chips, becoming the last of the major server computer operating systems to do so. Sun Microsystems was beaten to the punch by Microsoft, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and the collection of programmers working on adapting the Linux operating system to run on the forthcoming chip. The processor had been code-named Merced but now is called Itanium. The only reason for Sun's lag was that it's hard to get access to the Intel prototype hardware used to test out software, said Jonathan Han, product manager for Solaris on Intel. Solaris is Sun's version of the Unix operating system. "Unfortunately, hardware access has been the gating factor," Han said. Once the company got access, it took less than a week to get Solaris working on the new chip, he said. Getting established operating systems up and running on a new chip is a critical stage in creating products for any processor. An operating system, the special software that's in charge of a computer, is needed before higher-level software such as a financial application or image editor can run. The Itanium will be the first in a new line of chips that will form the "IA-64" family, a new architecture originally conceived at HP. Intel says it will have room to outgrow current high-end chips from IBM, Sun, and Compaq Computer, among others. A version of Windows and Linux were demonstrated when Intel unveiled the first Itanium samples in late August. HP said in September that its version of Unix, called HP-UX, was running on the Itanium prototype. IBM had passed a similar milestone for its new operating system about two weeks earlier, called Monterey-64. Monterey-64 is a combined version of the Unix products from IBM, the Santa Cruz Operation, and Sequent, a server maker IBM acquired. The Unix landscape got a little simpler last month when Compaq reversed its plan to translate its Unix, called Tru-64, to the IA-64 chips. Instead, Tru64 will work only on Compaq's Alpha chips. Sun's servers and workstations are based on Sun's own chip, the UltraSparc, but the company also sells the Solaris OS for Intel chips. However, the current Intel version of Solaris is less powerful, running only on 32-bit chips, whereas the UltraSparc version of Solaris runs on 64-bit chips. A 64-bit operating system is able to deal with much larger amounts of memory and much larger databases of information, important factors for high-end systems that handle tasks such as keeping track of all of a large company's accounts. The advent of the new 64-bit chips from Intel means it will be easier for software companies to make sure their software runs on Intel and UltraSparc system. Software will be about 95 percent alike for the two systems, Han said. The arrival of a 64-bit Solaris on Intel chips won't cause Sun to change its Solaris strategy, Han said.
2003-02-26 - Sun shines light on chip plans SAN FRANCISCO--Taking a page from the Intel playbook, Sun Microsystems revealed on Tuesday many of its future microprocessor plans as part of an effort to illustrate why the company continues to push its own chips. Sun has traditionally gone its own way with its servers, forsaking technology such as Intel processors and the Windows and Linux operating systems that most Sun competitors embraced. As that technology has improved and encroached further into Sun's market, many have criticized the company for shunning it or adopting it late. But Sun began a counterattack Tuesday at its annual analyst conference here, shedding more light on its chip plans to show why it thinks its UltraSparc processors are worth buying now and in the future. "We have not been sharing our future plans with you, so you don't see what we see," said David Yen, Sun's executive vice president for processors, saying the policy was responsible for analyst reports "indicating Intel has won...and Sparc no longer is relevant." Changing that policy, Yen detailed several processors scheduled to arrive in coming years, including the UltraSparc IV and V models and the "throughput computing" technology acquired from Afara Websystems. Sharing product plans--"road maps" in industry argot--is a good strategy for persuading customers that Sun is worth sticking with, said Insight64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel and IBM all share such plans, he said. "Certainly I think it was important to be more open about it," Brookwood said. Part of the decision to share the plans lay with Andy Ingram, who took over as Sun's vice president of marketing for processor products in 2002 and began studying Sun's detailed chip strategy. "I looked at it and said, 'We're going to go public,'" Ingram said in an interview. Intel describes many of its chip plans twice a year at its Intel Developer Forum conferences. In the pipeline Sun disclosed several specific processor plans at the conference Tuesday: The UltraSparc IV processor, due later this year, has two cores etched onto the same slice of silicon. The chip will slip into existing servers with UltraSparc III processors. A version of UltraSparc IV, code-named Gemini and designed for lower-end servers such as thin "blade" systems, is due in products to ship in 2004. Sun said earlier this month that blade servers with the dual-core UltraSparc processors should arrive in the first half of 2004. Gemini, like UltraSparc IV and the newest UltraSparc III, will be built using a 130-nanometer manufacturing process. The UltraSparc V processor, due in 2005, will have "five times the performance of processors we have today," Yen said, and will have better features for data protection and use in massive multiprocessor machines. The chip also will be able to perform a host of new operations, called the VIS Instruction Set 3. Where previous VIS extensions accelerated media operations such as encoding video, VIS 3 will speed more general applications such as encrypting data, said Michael Splain, chief technologist of Sun's processor group. UltraSparc V will be built on a 90 nanometer process. It will also feature the ability to switch between two different modes of operation: one designed for business computing jobs such as wrangling databases, the other for technical computing jobs such as modeling car crashes. The first chips based on Sun's Afara acquisition will arrive in 2005 and will be built on a 90 nanometer process. The chips, code-named Niagara, sacrifice sophisticated abilities to run one task fast in favor of a simpler design that runs many tasks, or threads, simultaneously--a concept Sun calls "chip multi-threading" and that fits into its overall throughput computing plan. Niagara also will have high-level Ethernet networking and encryption capabilities built into silicon, Splain said. Each Niagara chip will have eight "cores" that can independently run four threads, with much of Sun's secret sauce being in the rules that determine which thread is active, Splain said. Sun will merge Niagara lineage with the UltraSparc lineage after 2005 in a processor 30 times faster than today's 1.2GHz UltraSparc III, Yen said. This new chip "will provide hardware features to do Java acceleration and will extensively utilize asynchronous circuitry," Yen said. Sun has been working for years on asynchronous chip designs in which different parts of a chip are governed by different clocks so the entire processor, with millions of transistors, doesn't have to march in lockstep. Knocking Itanium Sun Chief Executive Scott McNealy was subdued at the conference Monday but resumed some of his trademark style Tuesday, jabbing at competitors. One target was Intel's Itanium processor, codesigned by Hewlett-Packard. The Itanium design tries too hard to execute one thread quickly, a strategy that suffers diminishing returns and requires too much circuitry, McNealy and other Sun executives argued. "David Yen can beat Itanium. There's no question," McNealy said. Sun Chief Technology Officer Greg Papadopoulos criticized Itanium's size and the fact that software written for widely used Pentium and Xeon chips has to be rewritten for Itanium. "They can't physically fit two Itanium cores on the same die (silicon chip) until 2005. They're way behind," Papadopoulos said. And Intel didn't learn lessons from Digital Equipment and Motorola, which changed the set of instructions their processors understood when moving from VAX to Alpha and from the 68000 designs to the PowerPC designs, respectively. McNealy also disparaged Hewlett-Packard for deciding to move away from its own PA-RISC processors. "PA is a pretty interesting architecture, and we're glad they put a fork in it," McNealy said. Sun has no regrets that it relies on Texas Instruments to build its microprocessors--especially as the transition to larger, 300mm silicon wafers puts more pressure on chipmakers to fill their factory capacity. At the same time, the company said Texas Instruments isn't an exclusive partner. "We're going to go out and buy best-of-breed silicon technology from a variety of sources," Splain said.
2002-06-17 - Sun server in "Cherry" flavor on its way   Sun Microsystems plans to announce Tuesday its long-awaited four-processor "Cherrystone" server, a key product in the company's effort to stave off Intel-based competition. The Sun Fire V480, with up to four 900MHz UltraSparc III processors, is a little brother to the V880, an eight-processor system that has proved extremely successful for the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company. The V480 is a replacement to the UltraSparc II-based 450, which ranges in price from $18,695 to $52,195. Prices for the V480 should be announced Tuesday. In addition, Sun will bring its faster 900MHz UltraSparc III processors to the V880, which previously used the earlier 750MHz processors, Sun said in a media advisory Monday. The 900MHz V880s already are for sale on Sun's Web site. Sun faces competitive pressure from IBM and Hewlett-Packard in midrange and high-end Unix servers, but it dominates in lower-end machines. In that segment of the market, though, Sun has competition from Intel servers running Windows and Linux; the V480 is aimed at keeping those rivals at bay. Sun has released numerous servers based on its newer UltraSparc III processor, but the four-processor Cherrystone system is arriving later than hoped. When Sun debuted its first UltraSparc III systems more than 20 months ago, executives said the entire UltraSparc III line would be on sale within a year. To deal with a recent spending slowdown, Sun has laid off staff and is shutting down for a mandatory vacation the week of July 4, a step it took in 2001 as well. The company has stood by its plan to return to profitability this quarter. Sun's systems use 64-bit processors, a major advantage when running large databases. Intel hopes its 64-bit Itanium line will help address this weakness in its product line. Its first-generation Itanium systems weren't a serious factor in the market, but Intel hopes that Itanium 2 systems coming later this summer will prove more successful. A four-processor Itanium 2 system will cost about $41,000 with 8GB of memory, said Vaughn Mackie, enterprise platform marketing manager at Intel, speaking at a media event Friday. Sun sells two categories of UltraSparc III servers. The "volume" systems use components and manufacturing methods drawn from the larger world of Intel servers, whereas higher-end systems all are based on Sun "Uniboards," four-processor building blocks that can be assembled into everything from eight-processor Sun Fire 3800 systems to 72-processor Sun Fire 15K "Starcat" systems.
2000-09-29 - Sun selling CEO-autographed computers on eBay  Oracle CEO Larry Ellison and Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy share more than just a loathing for Microsoft. Following in Ellison's footsteps, McNealy autographed five of his company's new Sun Blade workstations and put them up for auction on eBay on Wednesday. Ellison pulled a similar publicity stunt in July when Oracle spinoff New Internet Computer Co. auctioned 10 Internet appliances with Ellison-signed authentication certificates on Amazon. Although there still are seven days to go before the Sun Blade auction closes, Ellison's signature already appears to have been more of a pull to potential buyers. The New Internet Computers were bid up to $1,850, more than nine times the regular $199 price tag, company spokesman Michael Salort said. But with the Sun Blades' bids up to $8,100 as of today, the McNealy name hasn't been enough to carry the models up to even the $10,000 price Sun expects to sell them for through normal channels. McNealy's John Hancock left one bidder, Donald Goodwin, unmoved. "I could care less if Mr. McNealy signs them or not. It's a neat marketing tool, but I doubt it will add value to the system later on," he said in an email. "The reason I am bidding is that the price is actually pretty reasonable for the level of performance these boxes should provide." A price tag so far is a good deal, especially with a 21-inch monitor, but Goodwin said he expects the bidding to head north of his budget. The Sun Blade 1000 is the first Sun workstation to use the new UltraSparc III chip that Sun unveiled this week. Workstations are used by people with computation-demanding tasks such as creating animated movies, designing microprocessors or simulating car crashes. The Sun Blades themselves are an improvement to Sun's workstation line. The new machines are second only in performance to Compaq Computer Alpha workstations in number-crunching power, D.H. Brown Associates analyst Sarang Ghatpande said. However, Sun's graphics performance is another story, a problem that has hindered Sun's entry into many segments of the workstation market. "They definitely need to work on the graphics," Ghatpande said. "They're outdated compared to the rest of the competition." Sun's top-end Expert3D card uses the same graphics chip technology as 3Dlabs' Wildcat Intense3D graphics card built for Windows computers, but the "driver" software used to control the cards hasn't been tuned as well, Ghatpande said. "They took a Windows card and tweaked it around for Solaris," he said. "The raw performance is good, but the application performance is not that high." It's too soon to tell whether upcoming graphics systems based on Sun's MAJC chip will work well, he added. Unix workstations are generally more powerful than their Windows-Intel brethren, but the lower cost of the Intel machines is changing the market. The arrival of Intel's delayed 64-bit Itanium chip, which features much better calculating abilities than current chips, is expected to further boost Intel models. Sun has been selling workstations, servers, storage systems and other products at auction sites eBay, TekSell and Mercata for months in an attempt to win new customers. The company also has expanded the program to let other companies that sell Sun hardware buy their goods from auction instead of just from Sun. In the Intel workstation realm, SGI yesterday released its new Zx10 workstation, the latest model resulting from SGI's takeover of the Intergraph line. The Zx10 with a 933-MHz Pentium III has a bare-bones starting price of $5,135.
2003-11-11 - Sun seeks to gain from HP stumble  Hewlett-Packard has delayed one Unix server improvement and backed away from another, and rival Sun Microsystems is responding with a promotion to try to lure customers affected by the situation. The changes, which HP told customers about in October, primarily affect users of the AlphaServer line that HP acquired from Compaq and that Compaq in turn acquired from Digital Equipment Corp. HP is gradually phasing out the AlphaServer line, encouraging customers to move to HP's Integrity line of servers based on Intel's Itanium processor. In the first slip, HP has delayed by up to a year the time when HP's version of Unix, called HP-UX, will include high-end features from the AlphaServer's version of Unix, called Tru64. The improvements include cluster technology to share services across a group of servers, long a Digital forte. HP-UX 11i v3, the version slated to incorporate the technology, now is scheduled for release in the second half of 2005 rather than by the end of 2004, HP spokesman Jim Dunlap said. Second, HP decided to cancel the last AlphaServer processor, the EV79, and instead release a faster version of the existing EV7. "As the EV79 development program has progressed, working closely with our CPU chip supplier, it has become clear that the EV79 chip will not meet our expectations for performance or time to market," said Rich Marcello, general manager of HP's business-critical server group, in HP's letter to customers. The EV7 speedup, called EV7z, is expected to boost performance 14 percent to 16 percent over the EV7, Marcello said in the letter. Terry Shannon, author of the independent Shannon Knows HPC newsletter, said the EV7z is expected to top out at 1.33GHz. The earlier EV79 plan, which would have produced a chip running at 1.4GHz to 1.6GHz, would have meant a performance boost of about 25 percent, he said. Meanwhile, Sun, the top Unix server seller but a company under fierce competitive pressure, has expanded a promotion called HP Away that offers a zero-percent financing lease to lure HP customers. The program began in July in the United States and was expanded to Europe, and now Sun has expanded it to Asia as well and signed up six new business partners to help customers switch to Sun gear. "The idea is to get them to move off (AlphaServer products) for roughly the same cost they're paying for maintenance for their existing systems," said Larry Singer, Sun's chief competitive officer. Sun's approach isn't a surprise. "They're attacking what they see as a huge vulnerability within HP," Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff said. "And it is a huge vulnerability. At the end of the day, the Alpha customers have a migration to go through. It isn't going to be a whole lot less painful staying with HP than going with someone else, whether it's Sun or IBM." HP countered by saying that customers should be leery of Sun's shifting strategies regarding technology such as support for the Linux operating system or processors from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. "We believe our customers want a credible, trusted partner and not one that changes its story frequently. Our customers know that HP is being upfront with them and welcome the frankness and honesty and therefore will stay with us," Dunlap said. Switching away from AlphaServers is a definite possibility, but those seeking better clustering technology on a new system are probably best off waiting for the new version of HP-UX, Shannon said. "You would not get the same features and functionality as what you will get from HP-UX. It's ahead of everybody else," he said. Clustering wasn't the only new technology coming with HP-UX 11i v3. HP-UX now offers partitioning, in which a server is divided so it can run several operating systems simultaneously, but v3 has a more sophisticated version planned called dynamic repartitioning, in which the sizes of each partition can be changed without shutting down the server. One customer who'll miss the new feature is Barry Strasnick, chief information officer of CitiStreet, a 401(k) administrator company, who otherwise is a big fan of HP Integrity servers. "I do wish they would be able to do the dynamic repartitioning that you can do with Sun. That's something where HP is a little behind Sun," Strasnick said in an October interview. Another feature that will slip with v3 is support for 128-processor Itanium servers, Shannon said. HP-UX currently runs on 64-processor Superdome servers. A second Digital operating system, OpenVMS, also runs on the AlphaServers and is being moved to Itanium. It's still scheduled to arrive in mid-2004.
2001-08-06 - Sun says UltraSparc V two chips in one Sun Microsystems has only just started delivering its UltraSparc III processor, but already the company is touting the split-personality of its upcoming UltraSparc V chip. The UltraSparc V will be able to switch between two different modes depending on the type of work the computer is doing, said David Yen, general manager of Sun's processor group. One mode will be good for heavy-duty calculations, the other for business transactions such as recording or retrieving information in a database. "We'll have architecture that will explore instruction-level parallelism, like the Intel Itanium, and we will also explore thread-level parallelism, like the IBM Power4," he said. "But instead of having two separate chips, we'll design the chip so we have the ability to switch through software to support either of the workloads." With instruction-level parallelism, a chip sorts different types of instructions into several parallel "pipelines" that do their work simultaneously, explained Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. With the newer concept of thread-level parallelism, or symmetrical multithreading, several different computing tasks can work their way through a single pipeline at the same time. But adding both these features to UltraSparc V requires a major overhaul, Brookwood said, and competitors Intel and IBM likely will have achieved the same thing by the time UltraSparc V arrives. "To the extent they go and do instruction-level parallelism and symmetrical multithreading in one fell swoop, that's a lot to bite off," Brookwood said. "There are some technical folks who would say it's better to do one big piece of technology at a time." The holdout The success of the UltraSparc line is key for Sun, the only major server manufacturer to resist the pressure to use Intel chips. Much of Sun's influence comes from the widespread number of programs designed to run on its Solaris operating system atop UltraSparc chips. Switching to another chip would be disruptive to software companies such as SAP or Oracle. Indeed, what has separated Sun from competitors such as Compaq Computer in recent years has been the support of software makers, said Sanford Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. "Sun had the worst microprocessor performance by almost any benchmark when it gained the most share," he said. "By contrast, (Compaq's) Alpha had the best and really didn't do anything." Designing its own chips is very expensive for Sun. The advantage, though, is that customers' old software will work on the new chips, making upgrades easier. Sun began shipping the UltraSparc III chip running at 750 MHz in late 1999. Sun and Texas Instruments, which manufactures the UltraSparc line, recently announced a new version of the UltraSparc III running at 900MHz and using faster copper interconnection technology. Sun originally planned a 900MHz UltraSparc III using the slower aluminum interconnects, but with the copper version done that chip won't be produced, Yen said. The copper version will begin shipping within 90 days. UltraSparc IV, a relatively small change from UltraSparc III, will arrive "at frequencies much higher than 1GHz," Yen said. UltraSparc V will run faster than 1.5 GHz. Intel in May debuted the Itanium processor, its high-end answer to UltraSparc and IBM's Power chip line. Shortly after, Compaq abandoned its own highly regarded Alpha-chip line, handing Intel the chip's design staff--including their experience with symmetrical multithreading. Hewlett-Packard co-developed the Itanium with Intel and is in the midst of a years-long transition to it from its own PA-RISC chips. SGI is likewise moving from MIPS chips to Itanium. IBM, while supporting Itanium, also has its own Power processor line. These high-end chips all are 64-bit designs, which means they bite off chunks of data and instructions 64 bits at a time and can accommodate vast amounts of memory. Intel's current 32-bit chips--Pentium, Celeron and Xeon--can generally only access much smaller amounts of memory, making them ill-suited to high-end computer tasks such as dealing with vast databases. Size a factor? The dual-personality approach will give the UltraSparc V relatively large dimensions, but because much of the chip will be used in either mode, the size penalty probably won't be severe, said Mercury Research analyst Dean McCarron. Chip size is critical because it has a direct bearing on how much it costs to make a chip, how much power the chip consumes and how much heat it gives off. Because Sun plans to use software to figure out which mode the chip operates in, "you wouldn't necessarily have to have a duplication of hardware," McCarron said. "Basically you're just deciding how best to allocate the execution units of the processor among the instruction streams coming in." Sun is playing catch-up in some ways. The current Pentium CPUs as well as AMD's Athlon and IBM's Power chips all can accomplish a task called "out-of-order execution," in which a chip isn't confined to executing instructions in the order the software sends them, Brookwood said. Out-of-order execution, a prerequisite for Sun's goal of instruction-level parallelism, lets a chip work on a new instruction even if the first is hung up in the chip waiting for data from slower parts of memory, Brookwood said. IBM in particular has pushed the concept forward with its Power chips, Brookwood said. "There's an awful lot of parallelism going on in Power4," he said, noting the two CPUs etched on the same piece of silicon, the symmetrical multithreading and the out-of-order execution abilities. "That'll be the chip to beat when it shows up at the end of the year." Though adding instruction-level parallelism to a chip improves its performance without requiring software companies to rewrite their programs, there is a hitch, Brookwood said. The problem relates to compiler software--which translates programs humans have written into instructions a chip can understand. Compilers are key to making sure the instructions fed to a processor are optimized to take advantage of the chip's features. "Instruction-level parallelism is very compiler-sensitive," Brookwood said. It's a lesson Intel is learning with the Itanium. Though the 900MHz UltraSparc III chips will arrive first in workstations, the chip will be used in servers "very closely" afterward, Sun's Yen said--certainly by the end of the year. It's likely the 900Mhz UltraSparc chips will arrive on the coming "StarCat" high-end server from Sun, which can handle more than 100 CPUs in some configurations. "We like to have some kind of a wow effect," Yen said.
2000-09-25 - Sun rises with new generation of servers   Sun Microsystems will release a new generation of Unix servers and UltraSparc processors Wednesday amid an effort to better match its corporate culture with an increasingly mature customer base. Meta Group says Sun must start playing nice with Microsoft and IBM, or Hewlett-Packard will reestablish itself as IBM's clearest alternative by the end of next year, and Sun will face an increasingly uncertain future. see commentary During an event in New York, Sun chief operating officer Ed Zander plans to showcase lower-end servers and workstations using the months-late UltraSparc III "Cheetah" chip, the basis of the new "Serengeti" server family. Built atop the new hardware will be Sun's "Net Effect" plan, which adds software bundles selected for specific jobs and promises to keep computers up and running. With the new generation of products comes a Sun that can be seen as older, and perhaps wiser. The company is in the middle of a cultural transformation, a change that some analysts believe may prove more difficult than mere product launches. Once a Silicon Valley rebel whose Unix products and UltraSparc chips bucked the Intel-Microsoft trend, Sun is trying to tone down its rhetoric and assume an attitude more befitting a member of the hardware establishment. In short, Sun is acquiring some of the personality of that stodgiest of computing corporations--IBM. "Two years ago, Sun's biggest target was Microsoft. Today, its biggest target is executives at Fortune 150 enterprises," said Robert Francis Group analyst Michael Dortch. "I think they've figured out it's in their interest to stop fighting technical fights with the Microsofts of the world and to focus on business problems with customers." The reason for the change: Sun has largely succeeded in its evangelism to convince the world that big servers are the best place to put important corporate computing jobs. Even Microsoft, long Sun's archrival, has acquiesced to Sun's server-centric worldview in its .Net initiative. The new line also is coming out at a crucial time, as HP, IBM and Compaq are revving sales efforts on competing products. Microsoft also this week will release a version of Windows 2000 for the server market. Yet so far, Sun appears to be the best at preaching the server sermon. Although other companies can brag about chips running at higher speeds, or servers than can churn out more operations per second, Sun's ability to smoothly integrate hardware and software on its servers has struck a chord with corporate buyers. The company has knocked aside IBM and Hewlett-Packard to become the top seller of Unix servers. Like its rivals, Sun is also building up its consulting division. But with success comes middle-aged anxiety. Zander, chief executive Scott McNealy and other Sun executives have been wrestling with how to coax the company out of its upstart culture, spokesman Doug van Aman said. "Sun was a quote machine," a company that "took every opportunity to quip," he said. "Now, it's becoming more statesmanlike," van Aman said, backing off from baiting others or rising to others' bait. "Humility is a part of leadership." Some analysts have speculated that Sun could start to see some market share erosion during the next year, and Intel's Itanium push will begin to gain steam as time goes on. Sun must also come to grips with partnering with consulting firms and other, potentially rival, computer firms. Corporate customers, whose computer networks are populated with mainframes, PCs, servers and software from a variety of different vendors, might not be receptive to the company?s push for a Sun-centric package; for example, a network made of computers running only UltraSparc chips, including the Solaris operating system, storage by Sun, thin clients and other Java and iPlanet software. "What concerns me more is, can Sun deliver the combination of its own products integrated with other companies' products and the services customers need to get all this stuff running?" Dortch said. For example, take data storage. Sun hasn?t been able to dislodge competitors EMC and Network Appliance, whose products attach to any sort of computer system. "Sun sees storage as a burger-and-fries sale," where Sun's storage systems accompany Sun's servers, said Yankee Group analyst William Hurley. But in today's world, with numerous manufacturers' servers all swapping data on the same network, "the burger-and-fries approach does not necessarily work. Sun needs to address that to remain successful." Server stats Sun's new systems will use the UltraSparc 3 chip, originally expected at the end of last year. Designed by Sun, but manufactured by Texas Instruments, the system will debut at 750-MHz speeds. Texas Instruments chief financial officer Bill Aylesworth has said that chip speeds will be increasing soon. "We've got product in the 750- to 800-MHz range and a roadmap to get up to a gigahertz and beyond," Aylesworth said in an interview. "That should be very competitive for Sun." UltraSparc 3 chips are manufactured with TI's newest technology, a 0.18-micron process and copper interconnects. By mid-2001, TI will start making 0.15-micron chips on larger 300-milllimeter wafers, Aylesworth said. Using a smaller process size shrinks the size of chip circuitry, cutting chip costs and increasing chip performance. Also at the launch, Sun will unveil its "Net Effect" initiative. This strategy is likely to tie together Sun's traditional server pitch combined with the "SunUp" program to keep computers up and running, in addition to a collection of hardware and software assembled for specific tasks. Initial systems likely will begin shipping in coming months, but the top-end system, code-named StarCat, isn't expected until April, Salomon Smith Barney analyst John Jones said. The upcoming low-end UltraSparc 3 machines likely will be priced low enough to take on Intel, said Giga Information Group analyst Brad Day. "They'll be much more aggressive in their price-performance positioning than we've seen before." One way Sun will achieve this goal is by using the same components across the entire product line, easing manufacturing and inventory planning, Day said. Competition concerns Sun is launching its UltraSparc line amid heavy competition in the Unix server market, which International Data Corp. says is growing well beyond its 1999 sales of $25.6 billion. HP is flush with the launch less than two weeks ago of its high-end Superdome server, which catches up to Sun's 64-CPU size and ability to divide a system into multiple partitions. HP says its PA-RISC 8600 CPU is as powerful as the UltraSparc 3 and that the successor 8700 due next year will surpass it. IBM, meanwhile, is by all accounts resurgent. Big Blue has wrenched away part of Sun's market with its high-end S80, which sells for less than Sun's current top-end E10000 server but offers better performance. In October, IBM will introduce the S80 successor, called S80Turbo, a similar design boosted by faster chips incorporating IBM's silicon-on-insulator (SOI) manufacturing technology. In 2001, IBM will introduce "Regatta," a 32-processor server with the upcoming Power4 chip. Weathering delays Sun may not have a technological lead, but it has won culturally, stealing the attention of software companies and computer buyers, said Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice. "If Sun didn't have the cultural tie-in, I don't think they would have had time" to weather the delays launching the new UltraSparc 3 systems, he said. Sun itself has said delays are par for the course. "Clearly, no technology company is immune from the trials and tribulations of bringing product to market," said Chris Kruell, systems product group manager. And don't count Intel and Microsoft out. Tomorrow, Microsoft will formally launch its own delayed product, the top-end Data Center version of Windows 2000, which runs only on a tightly controlled collection of hardware and can use 32-CPU systems--even though little Windows software can run on such powerful computers. HP's Superdome eventually will accommodate Intel's 64-bit chips and Windows 2000, but that change won't happen until the second half of 2002, HP said. The result of competition: "I think they may lose some market share to HP and IBM, particularly in the mid-range and high end, but I think they'll still maintain a significant lead in terms of first-place leadership," Day said. "I think HP and IBM are hungrier than they've ever been before. Sun will have to defend their installed base against that kind of incursion." One likely avenue for growth for a more buttoned-down and businesslike Sun is hiring presales technicians who can work closely with potential customers to help Sun win bids, Day said. "As they continue to move their large systems into a mainframe-alternative space, I think you'll see much more of those kinds of presales technical specialists being hired," Day said. Sun can't just become conservative though, in its attempt to court big-business customers. "In a world changing with the speed and unpredictability of today's business, you need some amount of risk-taking in your system to succeed," Dortch said. Indeed, IBM and HP have been adopting Sun's methods, he said. But Sun has a longer way to go, as exhibited by the invariant McNealy keynote address antics and top-ten lists. Indeed, the IBM-ization of Sun might bring some curious role reversals as Sun tries court the suits and ties of the world. "Ed Zander is stuck with being perceived as more conservative on a corporate level than Scott McNealy," Dortch said. "It'll be interesting to see if Zander becomes more footloose and fancy free and McNealy becomes more conservative in this high-end market." News.com's Ian Fried contributed to this report
2001-11-19 - Sun revving UltraSparc III past 1GHz   Sun Microsystems will refresh its workstation lineup with a 1.05GHz version of the UltraSparc III processor due early next year, the company said Monday. The chip shows several improvements over its predecessors, in part because of improvements at the Texas Instruments factory where the CPUs are built using copper wiring technology, Sun said. In addition, better system performance comes through an improved "compiler"--the software that translates programs into instructions the chip understands, beta software that will be final when the product ships. The chip is produced in Dallas using a manufacturing process that can etch features as small as 150 nanometers (0.15 microns), the same process used for the current fastest model running at 900MHz. Both models incorporate "low-K dielectric" technology to reduce power consumption. UltraSparc III, introduced more than a year ago, is the foundation of a new line of servers at the Palo Alto, Calif., company. Sun is relying on the UltraSparc III to fend off resurgent IBM with its Power chip design and Hewlett-Packard with its PA-RISC and Intel Itanium designs. Sun also is working on a lower-priced version of the UltraSparc III, the IIIi "Jalapeno," for systems with one to four CPUs. That chip will be produced on TI's 130-nanometer process, Sun said. The UltraSparc III has 29 million transistors, the electronic elements that form the basis of much of a chip's processing circuitry. The UltraSparc IIIi has 87 million transistors, most of the difference due to the addition of 1MB of high-speed cache memory on the chip. Jalapeno can switch off unused sections to reduce power use, the company said. And it includes for the first time a feature Sun Labs has been developing: "asynchronous" data transfer paths that let different parts of the chip be governed by different clocks. As chips get larger, it's more difficult to maintain the current design practice of having the entire chip march in lockstep to the beat of a single drummer. The chip is the first to include Sun's "Jbus" connection technology for chip-to-chip interactions on multiprocessor servers. In the longer term, Sun is working on its UltraSparc V chip, a split-personality model that can behave like an IBM Power or Intel Itanium chip depending on what processing task it's assigned.
2005-09-20 - Sun revamps Unix servers with UltraSparc IV    Sun Microsystems on Tuesday revamped its mainstay Unix servers with the new UltraSparc IV+ processor, a chip that doubles server performance but that soon will face new competitors. As first reported by CNET News.com, the UltraSparc IV+, code-named Panther, will be run at 1.5GHz and be available in midrange models ranging from the four-processor V490 to the 24-processor E6900. Those systems have been the bread and butter of Sun's business, but also a market segment under fierce attack by IBM and Hewlett-Packard. Sun last year had said it expected the dual-core chip to arrive at 1.8GHz. That clock speed still is expected, but now not until the first half of 2006, said Fred Kohout, vice president of marketing for Sun's Scalable Systems Group, which sells Sun's UltraSparc-based servers. Competitors are arriving soon, though. IBM's Power5+ and Intel's dual-core "Montecito" version of Itanium both are expected this year, though Kohout dismissed the latter chip family as "going nowhere." Boosting Unix server sales is an urgent issue for Sun. In the second quarter of 2005, the Unix server market grew 6.6 percent to $4.2 billion, according to Gartner, but Sun's share of that market dropped from 38 percent to 33 percent. HP was level at 29 percent, but IBM grew from 23 percent to 28 percent. Sun is keeping prices unchanged for systems using the new chip. At the cheapest end, a V490 with dual UltraSparc IV+ processors and 8GB of memory costs about $31,000; an E6900 with 24 processors and 96GB of memory lists for $1.1 million. More UltraSparc moves are expected soon as Sun aims to keep the processor family vital in the face of market share declines. For one thing, the UltraSparc IV+ will be brought to the top-end 36-processor E15k and 72-processor E25K servers "in the not-too-distant future," Kohout said. For another, Sun will bring the single-core UltraSparc IIIi+ to its lower-end Unix servers. Like the IV+, the IIIi+ is built by Texas Instruments with a newer manufacturing process that permits 90-nanometer features instead of the 130-nanometer process for the UltraSparc IV and IIIi. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter. Also in coming months, Sun expects to introduce its first servers using "Niagara," a processor whose eight cores can run a total of 32 instruction sequences, or threads. Two systems are expected, the 1.75-inch-thick "Erie" systems and the 3.5-inch-thick "Ontario" systems, designs that share the same enclosure as Sun's X4100 and X4200 "Galaxy" line of x86 servers, respectively. The UltraSparc IV+ models run Sun's Solaris version of the Unix operating system, but only version 9 or the new version 10. Sun decided to coax customers toward the newer operating systems for business reasons, not technical reasons, said Bob McGaughey, director of product management for UltraSparc IV and IV+. "We'd like people to move forward to Solaris 10. Solaris 8 very likely will come to end of life in a short period of time," he said.
2002-08-20 - Sun releases low-cost Unix workstation Sun Microsystems released a new, budget-minded Unix workstation on Tuesday. But as its influence grows in the Unix market, the market itself is dwindling. The Sun Blade 150 workstation, starting at $1,395, is the latest in a series of inexpensive RISC/Unix workstations designed to compete against workstations based around Intel chips running Windows or Linux. The new machine comes with an UltraSparc IIi processor running at 550MHz or 650MHz, up to two 40GB hard drives, and up to 2GB of memory. Improvements to the processor and the graphics unit boost performance by up to 76 percent, according to Sun. In recent quarters, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based manufacturer managed to increase its historically sizeable lead over its nearest rival, Hewlett-Packard, in the Unix-RISC workstation market. Sun now accounts for 69 percent of the worldwide shipments of Unix workstations, according to IDC. But while Sun's cheap workstations have proven popular, they haven't held back the tide. The Unix workstation market is now dwarfed by the Intel-Windows-Linux market, a conversion driven by lower prices and greater availability of software. Nearly four times as many Intel workstations were shipped worldwide in the first quarter, according to a report from IDC, and the gap continues to grow. Still, not all of the Intel workstations sell well. IDC estimated that fewer than 1,000 Itanium workstations were shipped in the first quarter. Overall, Dell Computer leads the total workstation market.
2006-08-23 - Sun recoups server market share    Sun Microsystems, which for years has lost ground to rivals, was the only one of the big four server sellers to gain share in the second quarter of 2006, new figures show. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company's server revenue rose 15.5 percent to $1.59 billion in the quarter, according to statistics from research firm IDC. The increase outpaced the overall growth of 0.6 percent to $12.29 billion worldwide, with faster gains in x86 servers, blade servers and lower-end models costing less than $25,000. Sun's three main rivals fared worse. In contrast, IBM's revenue dropped 2.2 percent to $3.42 billion; Hewlett-Packard's dropped 1.7 percent to $3.4 billion; and Dell's dropped 1.3 percent to $1.27 billion. Sun has been striving to turn around its core server business for years after seeing its revenue and relevance plunge during the dot-com crash earlier this decade. Among its recent moves has been the introduction of its "Galaxy" line of x86 servers using Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron chips and its UltraSparc T1 "Niagara"-based servers that run many threads of simultaneous instructions with low electrical power consumption. But a more important part of Sun's recovery was from high demand for its mainstream servers using its UltraSparc IV+ chip, upgraded last week with 1.8GHz models. IBM is fighting back with faster Power5+ processors across its entire Unix server line, while HP will respond in coming weeks with Intel's faster but delayed "Montecito" version of Itanium. Servers using x86 chips such as AMD's Opteron and Intel's Xeon were the "growth engine" of the overall market, with a 3.3 percent increase to $5.9 billion. But new technologies have slowed buying behavior, IDC analyst Jed Scaramella said in a statement. "This growth has been tempered by the introduction of technologies such as virtualization and dual-core into the x86 server space," he said. "Enterprises are employing these technologies to increase the efficiency of their installed server systems, rather than deploying new systems." In terms of unit shipments, the x86 server market grew 9.8 percent to 1.68 million systems, IDC said. Sun's shipments increased 48 percent and HP's rose 3.6 percent, while Dell and IBM x86 server shipments decreased. Among other IDC findings: Blade server revenue grew 37.1 percent while shipments increased 29.7 percent. IBM and HP are virtually tied, IDC said; IBM had 39.5 percent of the market compared with 38.9 percent for HP. Linux server revenue grew 6.1 percent to $1.5 billion, 12 percent of the overall market. That's the first time in the last 15 quarters that growth was less than 10 percent. Unix server revenue shrank 1.6 percent to $4.3 billion, while Windows server revenue grew 3.1 percent to $4.2 billion. Itanium server revenue grew 36.4 percent to $740 million. Servers with AMD's Opteron chip accounted for 20.2 percent of x86 server revenue. Revenue from lower-end systems costing up to $25,000 grew 6.2 percent, but for systems between $25,000 and $500,000 it dropped 3.5 percent and for higher-end models it fell 6.9 percent.
2006-12-08 - Sun puts 16 cores on its 'Rock' chip   SAN FRANCISCO--Sun Microsystems, already an aggressive advocate of multicore processing, will try to stay a step ahead of the game by putting 16 cores in its high-end Rock chip. With overheating capping chip speeds, chipmakers have been scrambling to improve performance instead by packing multiple processing engines onto a single slice of silicon. Sun got an early start with its UltraSparc T1 "Niagara" processor, which has eight cores, and it looks like Rock will keep the company a step ahead of the competition. Rock will have 16 cores, John Fowler, executive vice president of Sun's systems business, said in an interview Thursday. Rock-based servers, due to arrive in servers in 2008, will likely come as competitors' chips have at most eight cores, analysts say. Boosting performance is crucial to Sun's attempt to reverse the diminished influence and use of its Sparc family of processors, which have lost share to mainstream x86 chips from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices and to rivals such as IBM's Power family. "Sun clearly has gone further with multicore approaches, even with Niagara and Niagara 2, than everybody else. This is just a logical extrapolation of what they've done," said Insight64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. "If it's going to 16 cores, with multiple threads (independent instruction sequences) per core, it's going to be a real barn-burner." Servers for years have been built with multiple processors, so it's not as if competitors lacking a 16-core design will have no answer to Sun's products. But packing more performance into a single processor provides a way to reduce processor and system manufacturing costs and to boost performance without compounding today's problems with keeping data centers cool. A Rock design-completion milestone called "tape-out" for the chip is just a few weeks away, Marc Tremblay, Sun's chief architect, said in a meeting here Wednesday. The company is holding a contest right now: if Sun engineers don't tape out the design by December 31, they'll all have to wear a tie, formal attire that Tremblay suspects is lacking from many of the designers' wardrobes. Among competitors, Intel just moved to quad-core designs by mounting two silicon chips in a single processor package, and AMD's "Barcelona," with four cores on one slice of silicon, is due in mid-2007. Brookwood believes it possible some of these competitors will be able to release eight-core designs in 2008, but not 16. Moving at a more stately multicore pace is Intel's Itanium family, which just reached dual-core status. Even Power6, due in 2007 from multicore pioneer IBM, will have only dual cores. A Fujitsu Sparc64 processor due in 2008 will have four cores. Defining what exactly constitutes a core is a tricky business, though. David Yen, Sun's previous Sparc chief, said earlier that some Rock features are shared across multiple cores, blurring the boundaries somewhat. Sun's chip reputation has been tarnished by years of delays and missteps in its Sparc processor business, said Greg Quick, an analyst with the 451 Group, but the company has partially restored it by meeting Niagara schedules. If it can show customers that Rock will significantly boost performance, Sun should be able at least to prevent current customers from phasing out their Sun servers. Heavyweight cores Niagara has eight cores, but competitors have dinged Sun because each core is lightweight compared with those in current chips, such as Intel Xeon or IBM's Power. With the ability to handle 32 threads, Niagara can get a lot of work done in a given amount of time, but the time taken to complete a specific task is relatively long. Rock's design has a more traditional emphasis on performance, though, with threads running faster when measured individually as well as in aggregate. "Rock tries to optimize for high per-thread performance," Tremblay said. A key part of that performance comes from what Sun calls scout threads. Scout threads run about 250 steps ahead of the main threads the chip is actually processing. The scouts try to predict the best path to take when they reach branches in the sequences of instructions taken, and they fetch data the main thread likely will need from main memory so it's stored in relatively fast-response cache memory. "The scout is the guy who does all the dirty work--all the snow-plowing in front of the main thread," Tremblay said. Sun was happy enough with the scout thread performance that it chose to pair one scout thread with each regular thread in Rock, Tremblay said. The two threads tend to run at opposite times, with the regular thread launching a scout thread only when it stalls waiting for data from memory, so Rock avoids some of the heating problems caused by multiple threads running simultaneously, Tremblay said. One consequence of the fast-thread priority is that the chip's clock speed matters more than in Niagara, which runs at a comparatively slow 1.2GHz, Tremblay added. The x86 chips from Intel and AMD have stayed in the 3GHz neighborhood as the companies moved to multicore designs. Out of order To speed execution, most modern chips don't methodically execute instruction sequences in a plodding, linear fashion. Instead, they employ various techniques such as out-of-order execution and speculative execution to get a jump on instructions a few steps ahead of the regular sequence. Niagara employs none of these techniques, each of which requires more circuitry and therefore increases the chip size and power consumption. But Rock takes the opposite approach--and then some. Rock goes a step beyond with something called out-of-order retirement, Tremblay said. When an instruction is retired, it means the chip has completed that step of processing and has committed its results to internal memory slots called registers. With speculative execution, the chip makes its best guess about whether or not to take particular branches--conditional decision points that depend on the results of existing calculations. Current chips are able to speculate about the best choices to take, storing results in temporary locations called intermediate registers, Brookwood said. But they don't commit those results to the real registers until the chip is sure the choices were correct. With out-of-order retirement, the chip commits its speculative results to memory and moves on without having to wait for validation. "What Rock will let you do is actually finish the instruction and maybe finish more instructions beyond it," Brookwood said. If the choices proved to be the wrong ones, the chip can quickly back up to the earlier state, and software moves backward along with it so that incorrect results aren't produced, Brookwood said. "It's an undo button...for the stuff that's been committed," he said. Software doesn't need to be rewritten to support out-of-order retirement, Tremblay said. Preserving compatibility is one of Sun's high chip priorities. Sun had an awkward phase with its processor plans, ripping up its road map, canceling the UltraSparc V chip and relying instead on a partnership with fellow Sparc chip designer Fujitsu. But the company now has a simpler, more attainable strategy, Quick said, and Sun is eager to boast about its progress. "We are very excited right now about how Sparc is going," Fowler said.
2004-07-21 - Sun ponders Solaris for Power Itanium  Sun Microsystems, which has already resurrected its Solaris operating system for one processor architecture, is considering a further expansion to Intel's Itanium and IBM's Power chip families. Sun floated the Solaris expansion idea during a conference call after reporting on Tuesday a return to revenue growth after 12 quarters of declines. The move happens at the same time Sun is embarked on an effort to bring its Java Enterprise System server software to rival operating systems. "We've begun looking at Solaris on Power as well as Solaris on Itanium as a way of delivering incremental volume," said Jonathan Schwartz, who was appointed chief operating officer in April. Sun believes that distributing as high a volume of its technology as possible will mean the company will be able to recruit software partners more easily and have a bigger foundation for future sales of upgrades, services and software. The Solaris project marks yet another aggressive expansion plan for a company that's cutting 3,300 jobs and trying to reduce expenses by $500 million in the next year. But Schwartz thinks it can be done. "We're not worrying about spreading too thin," he said in an interview. The Solaris and Java Enterprise System expansions are projects he initiated, Schwartz said. For years, Sun focused on just one processor architecture, UltraSparc, and one operating system, Solaris. Sun has been working to resurrect a version of Solaris for x86 chips such as Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron and Intel's Xeon. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based server and software company also worked on Solaris for Itanium, but that project was canceled before it yielded a product, because of squabbling between Sun and Intel. Intel and IBM could not be reached for comment Tuesday. HP--which initiated Itanium, helped Intel develop it and is its biggest advocate--saw evidence of Sun's troubles in the move. The Solaris expansion "demonstrates they know it's a two-horse race for high-end computing between Itanium and Power," said Mark Hudson, vice president of marketing for HP's Enterprise Storage and Servers group. "If they try to focus on both hardware--Sparc--and software they will fail, as they can't afford it," Hudson predicted. Schwartz said Sun is "very" serious about the effort and argued that it's in the best interests of rivals who wish to spread their chip architectures to support Sun's push. "It's up to the hardware vendors to worry about volumes, to join us in developing it and the ISV (independent software vendor) population," Schwartz said. "We have a very productive dialog currently ongoing with Intel. IBM has a bit tougher, but we'll get there." Solaris is working on Itanium servers in the lab, Schwartz said. Sun also is spreading its Java Enterprise System software to Windows, IBM's AIX version of Unix, and Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX version of Unix. Windows and HP-UX versions are due by the end of the year, Sun has said. It's easier to embrace rival technology these days, McNealy said, because there's less of it. "To be heterogeneous now isn't such a complicated thing anymore," McNealy said in an interview. "There's less stuff out there to be heterogeneous with. DEC is gone, HP-UX is going away, PA-RISC is gone," he said, referring to Digital Equipment Corp., HP's version of Unix and HP's in-house processor design. But Sun considers the non-Solaris versions of Java Enterprise System a stepping-stone. "We've got to provide (customers) bridges and migrations. Ultimately, it makes more sense to be on a Sun Solaris sever than other environments running JES," McNealy said.
2003-11-07 - Sun plans server with AMD's Opteron    Sun Microsystems Chief Executive Scott McNealy is expected to announce his company's intention to sell servers using Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron processor--a significant endorsement for the chip. McNealy will make the announcement Nov. 17 at the Comdex trade show in Las Vegas, sources familiar with the plan said. The move would make Sun the second, after IBM, of the top four server makers to back the AMD processor. The move isn't entirely unexpected. John Loiacono, head of Sun's operating systems products, said in April that Sun was likely to sell Opteron servers. And Jonathan Schwartz, Sun's top software executive, said in October that Sun will release a version of its Solaris operating system specifically for Opteron in 2004. Sun is expected to sell dual-processor and four-processor Opteron servers available with Opteron-specific versions of Solaris or Linux, a source familiar with the company's plan said. Sun spokeswoman Kasey Holman would not comment on specific plans, but said, "AMD is a great Sun partner, and we're always looking at ways to expand and improve our businesses." AMD spokesman Jeff Lowe declined to comment on Opteron server plans. Opteron is a bold departure for AMD. The company has survived, if not thrived, by making processors that are compatible with Intel's "x86" Pentium, Xeon and Celeron chips. Opteron maintains compatibility with those 32-bit chips, but diverges with 64-bit extensions that will let the chip gracefully address much larger amounts of memory. While the existing 32-bit software will run on Opteron, it must be retooled to take advantage of the 64-bit features. That retooled version of the software will no longer work on the 32-bit chips, meaning that a company selling Opteron-specific software will have to support that version separately from the Xeon version. "Sun does run the risk of further increasing development and support costs," Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff said. "It is just an incremental increase, but in a company that is cutting costs and does have a lot of different irons in the fire, even incremental additions are something to have some concern with." There are potential advantages to be gained, however. Although Sun hasn't committed to creating a 64-bit Opteron version of its Java Enterprise System server software suite, Schwartz said the 64-bit version of Java shows performance improvements over the 32-bit x86 version. Although Intel strongly backs its Itanium processor for 64-bit computing, it's possible the company has quietly taken a similar step as AMD. Although Intel won't comment on the possibility, David Yen, head of Sun's processor and network products group, believes Intel has added 64-bit extensions to its next-generation "Prescott" family of Pentium chips. So far, the highest-profile endorsement of Opteron has come from IBM, which uses the chip in its dual-processor e325 server that Big Blue began discussing in April.
2005-09-21 - Sun plans lower-end Niagara chip   SAN FRANCISCO--Sun Microsystems' forthcoming Niagara chip has eight processor cores, but the company will sell versions with six or possibly even four, the company's top Sparc server executive said Tuesday. The lower-end versions are chips that have some manufacturing defects but that still are useful, said David Yen, executive vice president of Sun's Scalable Systems Group, which designs and sells servers using Sparc processors and the Solaris operating system. "As part of the manufacturing process, there are some processors with less than eight cores but still with very impressive performance," Yen said in a meeting with reporters here at the Oracle OpenWorld conference. "We will be offering the Niagara-based boxes primarily with eight cores and six cores, and we may start with four cores." The option for six- and four-core Niagara chips was first reported by The Register. Niagara is a crucial processor for Sun, a chip intended to send a message about Sun's commitment to the Unix server market, where it has been losing share. It's important enough that Sun will release Niagara before a more conventional processor, the UltraSparc IIIi+, for lower-end Unix servers. "We are executing very well on the Niagara program. We would really like to show all the evidence we have, not just some virtual benchmarks," Yen said. At the same time, servers with the UltraSparc IIIi are selling fine and aren't crying out for the IIIi+ upgrade, he added. Sun has more than 100 Niagara prototype machines installed at customer sites so far, Yen said. The company has committed to ship them by early 2006, but Yen hinted they might arrive a little sooner: "We'd like to beat that schedule." Niagara is the opening salvo in a radical overhaul of Sun's Sparc processors, a family that competes with IBM's Power, Intel's Xeon and Itanium, and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron. Niagara employs a technology called chip multithreading (CMT) that uses numerous processor cores, each able to execute multiple instruction sequences called threads. CMT is designed to sidestep a persistent and worsening problem in microprocessor design: Chip performance increases faster than memory system performance, so chips spend a larger and larger fraction of their time idle as they await data from memory. CMT sidesteps this problem by juggling among different threads, switching to a new thread when another stalls to await memory. Sun has publicly discussed two other CMT designs: Niagara II, which will work in multiprocessor configurations, and Rock, which is designed for back-end server tasks such as databases, where threads must execute swiftly. Niagara can execute as many as 32 threads, but not at top speed. Niagara II will be able to execute more threads, Yen said, but declined to share further details. He also said Niagara II will be followed by "subsequent Niagara families." Sun scrapped two more conventional designs, the lower-end dual-core Gemini processor and the high-end dual-personality UltraSparc V, to concentrate on the CMT designs. In the meantime, Sun signed a deal to sell an "Advanced Product Line" designed with Fujitsu and using Fujitsu's Sparc64 VI "Olympus" processor. Sun on Tuesday began selling midrange servers using its new UltraSparc IV+ chip, a dual-core model that doubles performance compared with its UltraSparc IV predecessor. Sun acquired the Niagara design when it bought Afara Websystems in 2002. At the time, the designers had finished the logical design of the processor but had only just started on the physical design, Yen said. The physical design is always a difficult step as engineers run into space limitations on the silicon die. "At the time we acquired Afara, Niagara was probably one-third done," Yen said.
2002-06-18 - Sun pins hopes on Cherrystone servers  Sun Microsystems plans to announce Tuesday its long-awaited four-processor "Cherrystone" server, a key product in the company's effort to stave off Intel-based competition. As earlier reported, the Sun Fire V480, with up to four 900MHz UltraSparc III processors, is a little brother to the V880, an eight-processor system that has proved extremely successful for the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company. Sun faces competitive pressure from IBM and Hewlett-Packard in midrange and high-end Unix servers, but it dominates in lower-end machines. In that segment of the market, however, Sun has competition from Intel servers running Windows and Linux; the V480 is aimed at keeping those rivals at bay. The V480 is a replacement to the UltraSparc II-based 450, which ranges in price from $18,695 to $52,195. The V480, a rack-mountable product, will cost somewhat more, starting at $22,995 for a two-processor server with 4GB of memory, said Warren Mootery, director of Sun's product marketing for volume systems. "We positioned it specifically against four-way servers with 1.6GHz (Intel) Xeons," Mootery said. A V480 with 4GB of memory and two of its four-processor slots full costs less than four-processor-capable Xeon servers from Dell Computer, Hewlett-Packard or IBM with two processors installed, the same amount of memory, and Microsoft's Windows 2000 Advanced Server operating system, he said. However, Sun's prices go up steeply. A four-processor server with 16GB of memory costs $46,995, and a four-processor model with 32GB of memory goes for $99,995. Sun also will sell V480s bundled with its T3 midrange storage products. Those products range in price from $44,595 to $122,995, Mootery said. Also Tuesday, IBM will announce that it's shipped its 1,000th top-end p690 "Regatta" Unix server, which went on sale about six months ago and typically costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Spiegel Group--which runs retailers including Eddie Bauer, Newport News and Spiegel Catalog--bought the p690 to replace 15 non-IBM servers. Sun has released numerous servers based on its newer UltraSparc III processor, but the four-processor Cherrystone system is arriving later than hoped. When Sun debuted its first UltraSparc III systems more than 20 months ago, executives said the entire UltraSparc III line would be on sale within a year. Also planned for Tuesday, Sun will bring its faster 900MHz UltraSparc III processors to the V880, which previously used the earlier 750MHz processors, Mootery said. The 900MHz V880s already are for sale on Sun's Web site. To deal with a recent spending slowdown, Sun has laid off staff and is shutting down for a mandatory vacation the week of July 4, a step it took in 2001 as well. The company has stood by its plan to return to profitability this quarter. Sun's systems use 64-bit processors, a major advantage when running large databases. Intel hopes its 64-bit Itanium line will help address this weakness in its product line. Its first-generation Itanium systems weren't a serious factor in the market, but Intel hopes that Itanium 2 systems coming later this summer will prove more successful. A four-processor Itanium 2 system will cost about $41,000 with 8GB of memory, said Vaughn Mackie, enterprise platform marketing manager at Intel, speaking at a media event Friday. Sun sells two categories of UltraSparc III servers. The "volume" systems use components and manufacturing methods drawn from the larger world of Intel servers, whereas higher-end systems all are based on Sun "Uniboards," four-processor building blocks that can be assembled into everything from eight-processor Sun Fire 3800 systems to 72-processor Sun Fire 15K "Starcat" systems. Processors aren't the only point of comparison when pitting Intel servers against Sun servers. Also important are reliability features, software availability, high-speed cache memory, and input-output systems. V480 comes with PCI slots for plugging in network cards or interfaces to storage systems, a slower standard than the PCI-X now shipping with Intel servers. "We didn't incorporate PCI-X. We're looking at it, but we're not sure if we're going to go that route," Mootery said. "We have pretty good throughput." While PCI is adequate for today's workloads, the future likely will tell a different story, said Cary Snyder, an independent analyst who monitors system technology such as PCI. For one thing, coming 10-gigabit-per-second Ethernet and Fibre Channel networking standards will consume huge amounts of data-transfer capacity. In addition, special-purpose chips to speed up networking means that regular processors will have more power left over to fill up data-transfer pathways.
2003-10-13 - Sun New chip can double performance    Sun Microsystems will announce Monday that its upcoming UltraSparc IV processor will outperform its predecessor by a factor of 1.6 to 2, providing more competition to Intel, IBM, Advanced Micro Devices and others. At this week's Microprocessor Forum in San Jose, Calif., the company will announce that it expects to begin making UltraSparc IV later this year, and it will debut at a speed of 1.2GHz in products by June 2004, said Andy Ingram, vice president of Sun's processor marketing group. UltraSparc IV packs two UltraSparc III processor cores onto a single slice of silicon. IBM used a similar technique to make its Power 4 processor, and Intel plans to follow suit with its Xeon and Itanium chips. Sun's chip will be able to plug into the same sockets as an UltraSparc III, meaning customers can upgrade their computers rather easily. Although Sun is remaking itself as a supplier of integrated collections of hardware, software and services, new chips remain an essential foundation for the company's products. UltraSparc IV should be fast enough to retain Sun's most loyal customers, said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. "This keeps Sun in the running," Brookwood said. "I don't know that UltraSparc IV by itself is going to persuade people...to switch to Sun, but it should keep those already in the tent (staying) in the tent." Sun has been challenged by the arrival of increasingly powerful processors from Intel and was forced to abandon its UltraSparc-only approach by using "x86" processors such as Xeon and Itanium from Intel and Athlon from AMD. Indeed, Sun will rely on these outside chips, said David Yen, executive vice president of Sun's processor and network products group. The latest performance figure compares computing tasks running on a 1.2GHz UltraSparc IV and a 1.2GHz UltraSparc III, Ingram said. "Over the life of UltraSparc IV, we should yet again double throughput, at least at the processor level," he said. Performance improvements are critical for Sun, RedMonk analyst James Governor said. "When it comes to chips, they have been getting hammered. Just in terms of raw power, they are behind," he said. Like Intel with Itanium, Sun has missed deadlines for shipping some chips, but its record is improving, Brookwood said. The first UltraSparc IV will be built using a 130-nanometer manufacturing process, but a newer version expected next year will use a 90-nanometer technique, Sun said. (A nanometer is a billionth of a meter. Manufacturers keep building chips with smaller elements, so they can squeeze more circuitry onto the same-size chip.) Best buddies At this week's show, Sun and Texas Instruments will celebrate the 15-year anniversary of their partnership. TI is helping to engineer the 90-nanometer UltraSparc chips, said Julie England, the Texas Instruments vice president responsible for the Sun work. "With Sun, we're in the middle of sampling product now," England said. "By the fourth quarter of next year, we hope to be ready to ramp to volume." Sun plans to add new reliability features with the 90-nanometer chip, Ingram said. Further improvements, such as the incorporation of circuitry to accelerate encryption and networking, will be offered in future versions. The 90-nanometer manufacturing process will use a technology called strained silicon to wring more speed out of the chips, England said. In addition, it will use a technology called "low-k dielectric" more widely than current chips and will push one key measurement, the length of a fundamental circuit component called a gate, down to 37 nanometers. One tangible improvement with the 90-nanometer process: Each transistor in the chip can switch off or on 50 percent faster than with 130 nanometers, English said. The size of the UltraSparc IV die is 356 square millimeters, Sun said. That compares with 374 square millimeters for the high-end Itanium 2 with 6 megabits of cache memory and 267 square millimeters for the Power4+. Smaller chips are less expensive to manufacture and consume less power. A new direction Sun's chip design plans have changed dramatically since the acquisition of Afara Websystems, a start-up that employed some original UltraSparc I designers. Sun previously had been focusing on executing instructions as fast as possible on a chip, a task made difficult by the inevitable delay of communicating with a computer's main memory. Chip designers have compensated by adding ever larger amounts of higher-speed cache memory to store frequently used information, but that's an approach that makes the chip much larger and more expensive. With the Afara technology, Sun has taken a new approach that emphasizes running several tasks, or "threads," simultaneously, switching to a new thread when one runs into the memory bottleneck. Though it has yet to be proven with real-world designs, Sun's new approach is a compelling way to deal with the problem of memory delay, called latency, Insight 64's Brookwood said. "They've started tackling latency in a very positive way," he said. "Instead of trying to paper over latency with bigger and bigger caches, they're saying, 'Let's design a chip that says latency is a fact of life and makes the best of it.'" The first Afara processor, code-named Niagara, will arrive in 2005 or 2006. It's designed for lower-end servers that handle chores such as serving Web pages. A still-unnamed higher-end processor will be able to handle individual tasks quickly as well as juggle between multiple ones. The brand name for this post-UltraSparc V processor has yet to be determined, Ingram said. Ingram said that processor will combine chip technology from today's UltraSparc lineage, Afara and the MAJC that Sun years ago had hoped would succeed UltraSparc. Elsewhere in chipdom Several other chipmakers will use the Microprocessor Forum stage to discuss new processors for servers and other kinds of computers. Fujitsu will discuss the latest addition to its family of SPARC64 chips, the SPARC64 VI. The chip represents Fujitsu's latest spin on the Sparc processor architecture. IBM will make a presentation on its Power 5 processor for high-end servers that is due out next year. Transmeta and Via Technologies will also join the forum to unveil details on PC processors. Transmeta will use the forum to launch its Efficeon processor, a new chip for notebook PCs. Via will discuss two new processors, according to the Microprocessor Forum's Web site.
2004-09-11 - Sun looks to chip performance to bring brighter days   Sun Microsystems wants to distinguish its future servers by fitting them with new chips that get their jobs done more efficiently. The computer maker got that ball rolling with its UltraSparc IV chip, a dual-core processor that came out in March and now ships in about 50 percent of Sun's high-end Sun Fire servers, according to Sun executives who spoke at an informal press briefing Friday afternoon. Sun plans to offer the UltraSparc IV chip, which had been reserved for high-end Sun Fire servers, in new four- and eight-processor Sun Fire servers this month. Right now the company's Sun Fire v480 and v880 offer four and eight UltraSparc III chips and start at about $20,000 and $33,000, respectively. But adding the UltraSparc IV chips, each of which can handle two simultaneous threads, or streams of data, will boost their performance by about 50 percent, said Andy Ingram, vice president of marketing for Sun's Scalable Systems Group. Thus, the new four-processor Sun Fire server will perform like a Sun Fire v880 with eight-processors but offer roughly the same cost and footprint of the current four-processor machines. "It's safe to say that...what you'll get with the upgrade is the footprint and cost of a four-way (server) and the throughput of an 8-way system," he said. Sun, which made public a few additional details on the forthcoming chips on Friday, aims to amplify that example with its future processors, all of which include multiple cores and capabilities to handle many more threads. The beleaguered company is hoping to percolate higher-performance throughout its server line as it looks to return to steady profitability and compete with the likes of fellow system builders, including IBM and Hewlett-Packard. UltraSparc IV and its descendant, the UltraSparc IV+, due next year, will be the first in the series of new processor offerings, which Sun plans to deliver over the next four years. The company will first boost the clock speed of the UltraSparc IV before moving to a new 90-nanometer design for UltraSparc IV+ next year. The collective improvements are expected to double the chip's performance, Ingram said. Then, during 2006, Sun will bring out two new processors, another dual-core, dubbed Olympus, and a multicore chip capable of handling 32-threads, called Niagara. Rock, designed to be a high-end chip for speeding up applications such as databases, will arrive in 2008, Ingram said. It wasn't an easy road to Olympus, though. Sun, which has been grappling with three years of revenue declines and several rounds of layoffs--although it posted a fiscal fourth quarter profit in July--canceled its UltraSparc V project to work with Fujitsu on Olympus. Olympus will feature dual cores and is essentially combining two Fujitsu UltraSparc chips into one. Meanwhile, Niagara is being designed for applications such as Web servers, and with its multiple cores it will be able to handle 32 threads simultaneously, Ingram said. A second version of the chip, Niagara 2, will be even more specialized for such applications, he said. A 65-nanometer process will be used to manufacture Niagara 2, meaning it should arrive sometime in 2008. Rock will also be capable of 32-threads, but it will be geared more toward databases and applications that require more floating point or number crunching capability, he said. The 65-nanometer process will be used for Rock as well. Sun faces stiff competition from the likes of IBM, whose high-end servers run on dual-core Power5 chips, and also Intel, which plans to deliver a dual-core Itanium chip in 2005. Thus Sun aims to deliver chips that can handle more threads, boosting their performance for applications that its main customers use most often, including Web or application servers and applications such as databases, Ingram explained. Assuming the chips live up to expectations, Sun will be able to tout higher performance and at the same time potentially solve some other puzzles as well, including price for performance and power consumption. Using more-powerful multicore chips could enable Sun to offer similar or greater performance with fewer chips in a given server. Although a multicore chip might consume more power, be harder to cool and cost more than a given single-core chip, the need for fewer multicore chips could offset all those factors, Ingram explained. Indeed, although a single Rock chip might consume more power than another chip, it might take only one to replicate the performance of one of Sun's current Sun Fire E25K servers, which uses up to 72 UltraSparc IV chips, he said. "By doing that, for a given physical investment of power, cooling, space and cost, I get more throughput," or performance, he said. "There's lots of room for innovation where we can increase performance and drive down cost and power and heat dissipation issues through system design. We have to be willing to take a risk and think differently." Sun also sells a line of servers based on AMD's Opteron processor and another with Intel Xeon chips.
2003-04-08 - Sun likely to use AMD's Opteron chip   Menlo Park, Calif.-based Sun has been testing the forthcoming Opteron chip for servers in its labs, and has found interest for the chip among customers, said John Loiacono, vice president of Sun's operating platforms group. Although he couldn't commit to any definite product plans, Loiacono said that the chip, which comes out April 22, would probably end up in a Sun product. "Can we commit to using Opteron today? No," Loiacono said. "Can we use it? Are we likely to use it? Yes." The probable endorsement from Sun is one of the strongest yet for the upcoming chip. Although RackSaver and a host of second-tier manufacturers have come out with product plans, no large manufacturer has done so yet. AMD declined to comment. Sun's guarded optimism for the chip is a good sign for AMD, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst for Mercury Research. Opteron is designed for servers running up to eight processors, and that market is still largely controlled by the small circle of multinational computer makers. These manufacturers, moreover, tend to be fairly conservative when it comes to new technology. "If you can get a Sun or IBM interested, that is crucial," he said. Virtually all of the major manufacturers are testing Opteron, according to Jack Steeg, senior vice president of sales and marketing at Newisys, which is licensing designs for Opteron servers. According to Sun executives speaking at the company's quarterly product update, Sun-branded servers containing so-called x86 chips from AMD or Intel will also occupy a more prominent place in the company's overall product line, which is currently dominated by servers running Sun's own UltraSparc chip. "You will hear a lot about Solaris x86. There are over 1,000 applications on Solaris x86," said Sun CEO Scott McNealy, referring to the version of Sun's operating system that's tweaked to run on servers containing Intel and AMD chips. Sun, in fact, will update its LX50 server, which is designed for x86 chips, in the very near future, company executives have said. Although Opteron comes out in two weeks, Loiacono cautioned against drawing too strong a connection between the Opteron release and the pending update to the LX50. The chip requires a completely new motherboard. Sun is also working on other AMD chips. Change of heart The fairly buoyant endorsement of technology from the PC world represents something of a change at Sun. The company has engaged in a heated battle for years with Intel, deriding the performance of servers based on Pentium chips and mocking, whenever possible, the sales of the Itanium processor. A year ago, Sun deferred "productization" of a version of Solaris for Intel servers. Intel, for its part, has repeatedly noted how servers containing RISC-based chips, like Sun's UltraSparc, have become a smaller part of the overall server market. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. The shift appears to derive from equal doses of opportunity and desperation. On the opportunity side, Sun is positioning itself as a complete technology provider that will earn profits from sales of hardware, software and services. Intel- or AMD-based servers from Sun will be outfitted with Solaris and a variety of server applications, McNealy said. Even if these typically less-expensive servers don't carry the same margins as Sun's UltraSparc boxes, they will serve as vehicles to sell Sun software. The company is kicking off a Chinese menu-style licensing program called Orion to beef up software sales. "They (Sun) are making a bigger commitment to supporting other platforms, and what is the best way to do that? By having Linux or x86 in-house," said Kevin Krewell, senior editor at the Microprocessor Report. Additionally, the growth of the Linux operating system has made Intel- and AMD-based servers from Sun more palatable to some corporate buyers. In the past, these servers mostly came with Windows, making the Sun x86 boxes seem like oddities. "All of the sudden it is OK to (put) something other than Windows" on these machines, said Mark Tolliver, executive vice president of marketing and strategy at Sun. "The physics of the whole Intel market has begun to shift." Sun's decision to sell an Intel-based server, the LX50, under its own brand has also helped build momentum. "For some reason, it (putting the brand name on the product) adds more credibility," Tolliver said. Sun is also holding negotiations with other PC makers on selling Intel/AMD-based servers running Solaris for x86. These discussions have occurred on a regular basis for years, but "the volume of conversations has stepped up a bit," Tolliver said. Opportunity aside, Sun's move is also an outgrowth of necessity, according to IDC analyst Jean Bozman. Financial institutions and life sciences companies, two strong markets for Sun, already buy lots of Linux servers running Intel or AMD chips. Holding out would mean losing sales. "It is pragmatic," Bozman said. "These guys are gobbling up (Linux servers) like there is no tomorrow." Still, Sun won't overtly exert itself in this regard. The company, for instance, will rely on Asian contract manufacturers to design and manufacture Sun's x86 boxes. "We are not going to be in the x86 design business," Tolliver said. Sun execs also continue to pan Intel's Itanium chip. "I'd bet on Opteron before I'd bet on Itanium," McNealy said in an interview Monday.
2004-07-20 - Sun lifted by revenue growth Microsoft settlement  After three years of declines, Sun Microsystems returned to revenue growth in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Sun, a server maker struggling with competition against IBM, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, posted on Tuesday net income of $795 million, or 24 cents per share, for the quarter ended June 30. Revenue rose 4.3 percent to $3.11 billion from $2.98 billion last year. However, excluding the $1.95 billion it received from an antitrust suit settlement with Microsoft and other unusual items, it had a loss of $169 million, or 5 cents per share. Compared with the average expectations of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call, it was a mixed quarter. Those analysts expected lower revenue of $3 billion but a narrower loss of 4 cents per share. Chief Executive Scott McNealy said in a statement that shipments of Sun servers increased 46 percent from the year-earlier quarter. "Delivering growth and preliminary profits in the fourth quarter is a great way to end the year," he said. Sun is in the midst of major change to deal with its financial and market share losses, most prominently the appointment of Jonathan Schwartz as president and chief operating officer. Since Schwartz became the new No. 2, Sun has discussed releasing major software packages as open-source software, and Tuesday, Schwartz floated the idea of versions of Sun's Solaris operating system for its competitors' servers. In the quarter, Sun was boosted by the arrival of servers using the new UltraSparc IV processor--systems that accounted for 30 percent of shipments--and by resurgent purchasing on the part of Sun's two most important customer types, financial institutions and telecommunications companies, Chief Financial Officer Steve McGowan said during a conference call. Shipments of Sun servers increased 46 percent from the year-earlier quarter, which Chief Executive Scott McNealy said portends good news. "Volume matters," McNealy said during the conference call. "It is the leading economic indicator. It is what drives the long-term growth of this company," enriching software and hardware partners and increasing the number of customers that can later buy services, software or upgrades from Sun. But some analysts are still leery. "You had a very strong server unit quarter. Services revenue was strong, the storage attach rate went up, and yet you still weren't able to show any kind of stability...on the product gross margin side," said Goldman Sachs securities analyst Laura Conigliaro on the conference call. Gross margin--which declined because of the UltraSparc IV transition and other factors--is a key measure of profitability. But Schwartz took an aggressive tone. "We are now unquestionably on the offensive, with powerful resources at our disposal and an excellent product calendar," he said in a statement. And in an interview, McNealy said Sun plans on profitability, revenue growth and positive cash flow from operations for fiscal 2005. Sun called its $795 million profit "preliminary" until it receives confirmation from the Securities and Exchange Commission about accounting details of the Microsoft settlement funds. After years favoring only its own UltraSparc processors, Sun has introduced servers with Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron processor, a model that adds 64-bit extensions to the x86 line such as Intel's Pentium and Xeon. Sun's embrace of Opteron hasn't yet been materially significant to Sun's finances, the company said. One change will come with the arrival of Opteron models designed after Sun's acquisition of Opteron specialist Kealia. Sun is working on server designs that use the same chassis for either Opteron or UltraSparc chips, McNealy said, and Schwartz said that move will increase manufacturing efficiency. UltraSparc and Opteron both run Solaris, Sun's version of Unix, but those aren't the only chips the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is eyeing. Others include those of Sun's deepest rivals, IBM with its Power family and HP with the Itanium chips it helped Intel develop. Solaris on Power, Itanium "We've begun looking at Solaris on Power as well as Solaris on Itanium as a way of delivering incremental volume," Schwartz said--though McNealy immediately cautioned afterward, "That was not a product announcement!" Such an expansion would mark a much broader ambition for Solaris, which today runs almost exclusively on Sun's UltraSparc processors and Fujitsu's compatible Sparc64 processors. Sun canceled a version of Solaris for Itanium in 2000 before it was ever released as a product, nearly killed the version of Solaris for x86 chips, and never had a version for Power. Sun now has attracted 700 software companies to support the x86 version of Solaris, Schwartz said. Meanwhile, Schwartz also disparaged the top Linux seller, Red Hat. "We're seeing disaffection from the Red Hat community in response to their new pricing," he said, with customers concerned that they can't switch to another version of Linux. "Linux has become--because the cost of switching is so high--about one company, that being Red Hat." Regarding higher-level software, Sun signed up 128,000 new subscribers so far for its Java Enterprise System collection of server software, which the company sells for $100 per year for each person employed by a buyer. Sun now has 303,000 subscribers total, and Schwartz said he believes model produced pricing pressure is partly responsible for the financial troubles reported by many software companies. Sun is in the midst of cutting its staff by 3,300 from 35,400. A total of 2,400 were notified in the quarter that their jobs will be cut; the full reductions will be complete by the end of 2004, McGowan said in a conference call. The cuts are part of cost-cutting that will reduce expenses by $200 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30 and $500 million in the year ended June 30, 2005, McGowan said.
2000-03-03 - Sun Intel square off over Itanium support  Sun Microsystems and Intel are in a high-stakes game of chicken in a debate about which company needs the other more in the e-commerce world. Two weeks ago, Intel said it was rapidly winding down efforts to bring Sun's Solaris operating system to Intel's upcoming flagship Itanium chip. Sun, said Intel, wasn't doing enough to encourage software companies to rework their programs for the effort. This week, Sun reaffirmed its commitment to bring Solaris to Itanium and its successors in the 64-bit family, with or without help from Intel. However, doubts linger on how deep this commitment will go and what the final result will be. "Sun would like to hedge their bets, (although) Sun would rather remain independent and prove that they don't need Intel," said Robert Francis Group analyst Cal Braunstein. Whether Sun and Intel are allies or enemies will determine a crucial part of the Internet landscape of the future. If the companies are allies, then Sun would get another new high-performance chip to bolster its market position and spread its software philosophy. Intel would get to sell systems using one of the most popular operating systems for Internet operations. But if the companies separate, Sun is left with all its eggs in one basket, because all its UltraSparc chips are made by a single company, Texas Instruments (TI). It would be left competing more strongly with Intel, whose Itanium chips likely will cost less than UltraSparcs. That's too risky a strategy even for Sun, Braunstein said. "If TI cannot keep up with the semiconductor plants needed to keep pace with what IBM and Intel are doing, that leaves Sun stranded." If TI falters, the logical decision for Sun would be to throw in the towel on UltraSparc and go with Intel rather than seek help from IBM, which makes not only competing chips but competing servers, he said. A split also hands Intel some significant disadvantages. Namely, the disappearance of a respected operating system such as Solaris doesn't speak well for the somewhat anemic momentum of Itanium. Computer manufacturers and customers have largely said that they aren't even considering significant use of Itanium servers until the next generation of the chip emerges at the end of 2001. Competing in 64-bit market Itanium is Intel's first foray into the realm of more powerful 64-bit chips, which allow computers to store huge databases entirely in memory and which enable faster mathematical calculations. Intel hopes Itanium and the later members of the "IA-64" family will carry it into high-end computers that currently use chips from IBM, Sun, Compaq, SGI or Hewlett-Packard. Analysts expect the Itanium chip, due to arrive in computers later this year, to be useful as a test vehicle. However, most have higher expectations for Itanium's successor, code-named McKinley, which will offer higher performance and will arrive in late 2001 when companies have had more time to remove bugs from the new IA-64 chip family. The number of operating systems available on Itanium is dropping. Compaq canceled its program to bring Tru64 Unix to Itanium. SGI decided to use Linux for the new chip. And IBM, Sequent and the Santa Cruz Operation decided to merge their versions into a single package called Monterey-64. Solaris is the "only operating system that can give them what they need"--a computer for e-commerce that's proven and will stay up and running, argues Aisling MacRunnels, manager of the Solaris partner office. While Solaris may be somewhat more mature than Intel's favorites, bringing an OS to Itanium by all accounts requires major reworking, and Solaris is no exception. Despite such strong criticisms of Intel's strategy, Sun doesn't want to break things off. Fully committed? "Sun is fully committed to working with Intel to ensure the success of our joint venture," Anil Gadre, general manager of Sun's Solaris program, said in a statement. Sun lined up support from NCR and Fujitsu, both of whom plan to use Solaris in upcoming Itanium computers. But Intel, which wasn't included in the news release, isn't buying it. "We're saying the same thing same thing we said" in February when Intel publicly disparaged Sun's Itanium efforts, said Intel spokesman Bill Kircos. One thing the companies agree on is that current contracts require Intel to help only with Itanium, the first generation of the IA-64 family, and not with the McKinley chip that's expected to be more popular for actual use instead of just testing. Though Sun would like to get Intel's cooperation, it isn't necessary, MacRunnels said. "We believe we can do it independent of the situation. However, we are working hard to get their support," she said. For leverage, Sun mentions several computer companies that plan on selling computers with Solaris and Itanium chips: Siemens, Fujitsu, NCR, Toshiba, Unisys and Amdahl. Intel counters that these companies--called original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs--were well aware of Intel's unhappiness with Sun, which extends back to the summer of 1999. "The OEMs are and were well aware of our plans before the February news exposure," Kircos said. One awkwardness in the debate stems from Sun's internal organization. The company is split into several independent business units, each of which fend for themselves in terms of profit and loss. That means that while the software group responsible for Solaris is trying to round up for support for Itanium, the microelectronics group that sells UltraSparc chips is disparaging Itanium. Intel bridles at Sun's criticisms of Itanium, a chip that was known for years by the Merced code name. "Itanium will meet or exceed Sparc performance," Kircos said. Responding to Intel's criticism that Sun hasn't done enough to round up support from outside software companies, Sun points out the difficulties of advocating a chip that has been delayed. "When we signed the porting agreement with Intel (to bring Solaris to Itanium), we initiated a very aggressive program for getting (software companies) to port and support Solaris on Merced. The slips in the Merced schedule have made it very difficult for us to get a strong foothold there," MacRunnels said. "There's a lot of wait-and-see when it comes to supporting Merced as anything more than a development platform." But Sun probably shouldn't be pointing fingers. The current UltraSparc II was due to be replaced by the UltraSparc III "Cheetah" in late 1999, according to Sun's chip road map. Though the first UltrasSparc IIIs are late, Sun will roughly keep up on schedule of speeds, saying the new chip will be available at 750 MHz.
2000-07-21 - Sun Intel part ways on Solaris plans   Sun Microsystems and Intel finally are seeing eye to eye on whether Sun's Solaris operating system should run on Intel's upcoming Itanium chip: Now both companies think it's a lousy idea. In February, Intel drastically cut its support of Sun's effort to bring Solaris to Itanium, saying that Sun wasn't sufficiently committing resources or time to the project. Then the squabble escalated: Sun reaffirmed its plan to bring Solaris to Itanium, while Intel broadly hinted that Sun had become its primary competitor, and target, in the server market. Now things have changed. In an interview yesterday, Sun chief financial officer Mike Lehman said that running Solaris on Itanium, which was delayed again this week, is not an important part of Sun's future. "We're not going to fight that battle. Their customers will decide what they really want," Lehman said. Intel, for its part, hasn't changed its position. "We weren't seeing much commitment on Sun's part" or seeing interest by software companies writing programs for Solaris on Itanium, said spokesman Bill Kircos. "We're seeing overwhelming support for Windows 2000, Linux and Monterey, and that's where our focus is." Itanium is the first of the IA-64 family of 64-bit chips from Intel designed to displace high-end designs from Sun, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer, SGI and IBM. Though the chip has been delayed to the fourth quarter, analysts expect the architecture to be dominant in the long term, predicting that the large customer base will allow Intel to sell high-performance chips at lower cost. The alliance between Sun and Intel always had the appearance of a marriage of convenience. Sun has been the dominant company in Internet servers and having a version of Solaris for Itanium was seen as a way to speed the commercial acceptance of Intel's new technology. By contrast, adopting Itanium would allow Sun an alternative to solely depending on the UltraSparc processor line. Processor development is both expensive and laden with risk, and Intel dedicates far more research and development funds to chip development than Sun. On the other hand, part of Sun's popularity exists because the combination of two in-house technologies--UltraSparc and Solaris--allows Sun to provide customers with a seamless package that customers have found useful, analysts have pointed out. Intel says it will honor its existing contracts to help Sun bring Solaris to Itanium, but that's all. Intel executives have said current contracts don't extend to Itanium's successor, code-named McKinley, which is expected to be much more broadly accepted than Itanium. "Pilot systems" using McKinley are due by the end of 2001, Intel said this week. Sun's financial strength gives it ample breathing room. But if the future bears out what is being said by Intel and HP, inventors of the IA-64 architecture, then Sun's Sparc chip architecture will run out of steam. Compaq, Dell Computer, HP, SGI, IBM and a host of other big-name server companies have embraced IA-64 chips. Sun's new UltraSparc III Cheetah chip is due to begin shipping in systems this year, with low-end products showing up first and the new top-end server scheduled to arrive in January. UltraSparc III chips will debut at 750 MHz and 900 MHz, Zander said yesterday, and the company has begun to build models with copper technology that will run at speeds greater than a gigahertz. Texas Instruments builds Sun's UltraSparc chip line. At this point, Lehman said, Sun has no plans to look at adding another manufacturing partner, a move that would add cost but provide flexibility and potentially gain access to new microchip technology. "They've been a great partner," Lehman said. Sun and Intel are fundamentally different in that Sun builds chips chiefly for its own computers, whereas Intel builds chips chiefly for external customers such as IBM, Compaq, Gateway, HP, Dell and countless others. Intel has come to adopt Sun's strategy in some ways, however, sinking more effort into designing not only the CPU but also supporting hardware such as the chipset that governs the computer's internal communications and memory system and that is the key feature allowing companies to build servers with numerous processors. Still, Sun and Unix servers in general have a mammoth lead.
2002-08-06 - Sun HP speed Unix servers  Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard will give a boost to their Unix servers with faster processors Tuesday, but Sun's new chips will be able to coexist with slower models in the same computer. Sun's UltraSparc III currently runs at 900MHz, but the company will introduce 1.05Ghz models Tuesday for its higher-end systems, the Sun Fire 3800, 4800, 6800, 12K and 15K. And breaking new ground in its Unix servers, the new and old processors will be able to run simultaneously in the same computer. Sun hopes the ability to mix different speed chips--including future 1.2GHz models now in prototype--will make it easier for customers to upgrade systems without starting from scratch or discarding older parts. Sun's higher-end systems are assembled out of four-processor building blocks called "Uniboards," so customers can upgrade by adding more Uniboards to a system. In addition, a customer buying faster Uniboards could reuse the slower ones in other servers. Kevin Krewell, an analyst at Microprocessor Report, a semiconductor industry newsletter, said the feature is a good idea. Krewell expects Sun competitors to follow suit. "Giving an end user choice in how they upgrade their systems is always a good thing," he said. "It's a natural progression" in system design. The new features are part of a race among HP, IBM and Sun to improve Unix servers, which was a $20.6 billion market in 2001, according to Gartner. A shrinking server market has sped up the race to improve the systems as customers are harder to come by. HP, historically the No. 2 Unix server seller after Sun, is upgrading its two Unix server lines, both its in-house product line based on PA-RISC processors and the AlphaServer line acquired from Compaq and based on the Alpha processor. In coming years, HP is phasing out both processors in favor of Intel's Itanium family, which HP helped develop. HP's upgrades affect both of its Unix server lines, the company is expected to announce Tuesday. Its midrange Unix servers with four, eight or 16 processors are now available with the PA-RISC 8700+, an 875MHz chip that the company introduced in its top-end Superdome servers. From the Compaq side of the house, HP released a two-processor AlphaServer with 1GHz processors instead of 833MHz. Its four-processor systems have chips running at 1.25GHz, up from 1GHz, while also incorporating larger amounts of cache memory. AlphaServers with four, eight, 16 and 32 processors moved from 1Ghz to 1.224GHz and also come with a larger cache, HP said. While HP is betting the Itanium processor will carry the company to new heights, Sun is counting on its UltraSparc line. The new chips will increase server performances as much as 15 percent, said Chris Kruell, Sun's group marketing manager for enterprise system products. The faster processors will increase the cost of the servers, Kruell said. A Sun Fire 6800 with 16 processors and 64GB of memory costs $709,000 with the 900MHz processors and $869,000 for the 1.05GHz processors, he said. Mixing processor speeds is something Sun is better able to manage than Microsoft, Intel and their allies, who can't individually control all of the hardware and software that make up a computer, Krewell said. "Sun controls both the hardware and software and can fine-tune both together," Krewell said. The "backplane" that connects the Sun processors to each other and to input-output devices such as network cards runs at 150MHz, Krewell said, so Sun can accommodate processors that work at multiples of that amount--900MHz, 1.05GHz or 1.2GHz.
2003-05-16 - Sun HP prep new top-end Unix servers   SAN FRANCISCO--Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard are preparing new higher-end Unix servers for debut near the end of the year, and several other models will spring up from HP before then. The new high-end systems incorporate technologies that let customers double the number of processors in an existing chassis. The systems will compete with IBM's p690 and its successor, code-named Squadron. Sun will overhaul its systems with the new UltraSparc IV processor "right around the end of the year," beginning with the top-end Sun Fire 15K that currently has 72 UltraSparc III processors for business customers, said Clark Masters, executive vice president of Sun's high-end server line, in an interview Thursday. The UltraSparc IV is a "dual core" design with two processors on each slice of silicon, and using it will effectively double the number of processors that fit into each server. HP has doubling technology of its own, both with its in-house PA-RISC processors and Intel's Itanium processor, which HP co-designed. The PA-RISC line will get its first dual-core model with the PA-8800, code-named "Mako," and with an HP packaging technology called mx2, code-named Hondo, the company can plug two Itaniums into a single processor slot. The PA-8800 will make its debut in 128-processor Superdome servers late in 2003 or early in 2004, said Mark Hudson, head of marketing for HP's high-end server group, in a recent interview. And the 128-processor Superdome based on Itanium chips will debut in January, Enterprise Server Group chief Peter Blackmore said in a separate interview. The huge systems, often as large as two side-by-side refrigerators, highlight the renaissance of "big iron." Corporations are buying these powerful central servers to replace the legions of smaller machines that are difficult to manage and that often spend much of their time idling. The philosophy advocating large central systems is called, in industry lingo, "scale up," compared with the "scale out" approach involving smaller systems. "Scale out is all very well and good, but customers keep buying big iron, and vendors keep making the iron bigger," said RedMonk analyst James Governor. The two philosophies aren't mutually exclusive, though, he added: "Both technologies have a role to play." The Superdomes will use the Itanium 2 6M processor, a smaller, faster version of the Itanium 2 currently used in HP's two- and four-processor servers. Itanium 2 6M will make an earlier appearance as well, Blackmore said. In July, HP will make the debut of new versions of its midrange eight-processor rp7400 and 16-processor rp8400, which currently are available only with PA-RISC chips. And in 2004, HP systems will be upgraded with the faster Itanium 2 9M processor, Hudson added. Sun is the current leader of the Unix market, which had sales of $16.4 billion in 2002, according to research firm Gartner. HP is in second place, with IBM in third place but bringing its formidable technology resources to bear. It's been a market rife with brutal competition--not only from other Unix servers but also from increasingly powerful Intel servers and from mainframes. Sun, IBM and HP all have cut Unix server prices in the last six weeks. "Our objective is to take on IBM and lead the industry," Blackmore said.
2004-07-27 - Sun has software plans for rival servers   Sun Microsystems announced on Tuesday that its Java Enterprise System, a collection of server software, will be available on two rivals' operating systems early next year. Sun will sell its JES software for Hewlett-Packard's version of Unix, called HP-UX, and for Microsoft Windows in the first quarter of 2005, the company said. The software has only been available for Sun's Solaris version of Unix and for Red Hat's Linux. The JES expansion isn't a surprise: In March, Sun's new chief operating officer, Jonathan Schwartz, said the company was planning the move. At that time, however, he said the new versions would arrive somewhat earlier, by the end of 2004. Sun spotlights thin-client project The expansion is one of several examples of Sun branching out from Solaris and its own UltraSparc processors--its now defunct "all the wood behind one arrowhead" strategy. The company now is certifying its servers for Windows; aggressively pushing Solaris on x86 chips such as Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron and Intel's Xeon; advocating Linux on desktop computers; and experimenting with Solaris on Intel's Itanium and IBM's Power processors. The new directions, many of them led by Schwartz, are a response to Sun's financial troubles. From April through June, Sun finally reversed a 12-quarter declining revenue trend, though it wouldn't have been profitable without a $1.95 billion settlement from Microsoft. Sun charges companies $100 per employee per year to use as much of the JES software as they want, a scheme that's intended to increase the popularity of the relatively unsuccessful software suite by providing lower and simpler pricing. The price is the same for all the versions, according to Sun. Also on Tuesday, Sun is beginning a new promotion, one of several bundles of hardware, software and services that are bubbling up from the Schwartz administration. Customers who sign up for a $100-per-employee-per year subscription for JES also will get a dual-Opteron V20z server and "silver level" support. And Sun is extending an offer of free JES to companies with fewer than 100 employees, letting it continue through the end of 2004. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company also announced that Saskatchewan-based SaskTel has signed up for a JES plan. The company has 4,300 employees, though in this case, the math is more complicated: 3,330 employees are covered in the $100-per-employee-per-year JES deal, Sun said. The HP-UX version of JES is only for servers using HP's PA-RISC processor, which over a period of years is being replaced by Intel's Itanium. Sun also plans a version of JES for IBM's AIX version of Unix.
2005-10-26 - Sun has high expectations for Niagara  SAN JOSE, Calif.--Sun Microsystems' forthcoming Niagara processor performs well on a wide variety of tasks and shows greater ability than competing processors in multithreading, an ability to do many things at once, a top Sun chip executive said. Niagara has eight processing engines--called cores--each able to simultaneously execute four instruction sequences, called threads. It's neither the first multicore processor nor the first to employ multithreading, but it embraces both ideas more aggressively than competing chips from IBM, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Marc Tremblay, a vice president and chief architect at Sun, argues that Niagara--due in systems to arrive in early 2006 at the latest--benefits from being designed from scratch with multiple cores and multithreading. In a paper that's been accepted for publication, Sun will show that switching on multithreading gives a major performance boost, Tremblay said in an interview at the Fall Processor Forum here. "The industry is scrambling to get there as fast as possible with whatever (they) have in-house. We decided a few years ago to start from scratch," Tremblay said. "Not until you start from scratch do you see the full advantages." Specifically, running database tasks measured with the Transaction Processing Performance Council's TPC-C benchmark, running four threads in one core triples performance compared with running one thread, Tremblay said. Tremblay has bold words from a company that has struggled to deliver compelling chips in recent years. That has hurt Sun's market share while "Lintel" machines using Linux on Intel chips have gained. "We're going to attack new markets--markets we used to be strong in and lost market share," Tremblay said. "When was the last time a Sparc box had price-performance leadership in the Web tier? Everyone thinks it's Lintel." Intel's newest Xeon, code-named Paxville, is a dual-core, two-thread design, but successors coming in the second half of 2006 will drop the multithreading ability. IBM's Power4 processor in 2001 was the first dual-core server chip, and the Power5 successor introduced last year added two threads to the feature list. The next Itanium--code-named Montecito but delayed until mid-2006--brings a dual-core design and two threads per core. And AMD's Opteron is a dual-core design that can handle only one thread per core. Sun has a lot riding on its multicore, multithread initiative, called chip multithreading and sometimes throughput computing. Sun's Sparc processor family, hobbled by delays and lackluster performance, has been losing share to x86 chips such as Intel's Xeon and to IBM's Power family. Despite that, Sparc servers remain Sun's biggest revenue source, and improving the Sparc business holds the greatest potential for turning around Sun's financial troubles. The chip overhaul plan begins with Niagara, continues with a successor called Niagara II, and extends as far as a higher-end sibling code-named Rock, which is due in 2008. To achieve the processor overhaul, Sun scrapped its UltraSparc V processor and in the meantime signed a partnership with Fujitsu to use its Sparc64 VI processor in a server family called the Advanced Product Line. Sun plans two Niagara systems, the 1.75-inch thick "Erie" model and the 3.5-inch thick "Ontario" model. Lower-cost models Pricing will be aggressive, Tremblay said. Instead of pricing by the computers' ability to get work done, he said, Sun will price comparably to other slim, rack-mounted computer designs. Such models, most often using x86 chips such as Intel's Xeon, cost well under $10,000. Auction site eBay's PayPal division is among those testing the Niagara servers, sources have said, but a potentially higher-profile customer could be Google. The search engine company is buying unspecified Sun servers through a partnership announced earlier this month. Tremblay wouldn't say whether Google is a customer, but he did say Niagara is good for search applications and that "We've talked to Google several times over the years." In addition, Google employs Luiz Barroso, who worked on chip multithreading designs at Digital Equipment Corp., he said. "He's very familiar with some of that technology." Niagara has error correction on data transfers to its caches and to its most central memory slots, called registers. It also has four on-board memory controllers that are shared among all the eight cores. Suitable for Web work Niagara will be good for "Web-facing" tasks such as hosting Web sites and running Java applications, Tremblay said. But it also will work well for housing databases, a type of work Sun engineers studied carefully when designing the chip, he said. "Application servers and databases are beautiful" on the chip, Tremblay said, running well even if they haven't been optimized for the processor. However, Sun conceives of the Niagara systems as a suitable substitute chiefly for its lower-end models. He said that Niagara won't do well when a thread has to execute with top speed--when, for example, it is sending streams of media over the network. For fast thread execution, Sun will hold the fort with APL-based products due in late 2006, but the company is holding out hopes for its in-house Rock design. Rock will employ an idea, the "hardware scout," for which Tremblay holds several patents. Tremblay holds 102 patents, the most at Sun, including 36 related to multicore and multithreading. The hardware scout is a special-purpose thread that the chip launches by itself whenever the chip stalls because it has to wait for information to be retrieved from memory. The scout's job is to run software in advance of the chip's active task. Here, Tremblay grows metaphorical. "When the main thread is stalled, waiting for data, you launch a scout to plow ahead in the code. You try to run 300 or 400 instructions in front of the main thread to find the landmines," Tremblay said. "It's following branches, bringing instructions and data into the processor. It's basically plowing the snow ahead so you have smooth skating, doing the dirty work for you." The scout can help find areas where new data must be loaded into the chip's high-speed cache memory. Having the data in place when the main thread needs it can save 500 clock cycles--a "huge" improvement, he said.
2003-02-06 - Sun gathers Solaris-Intel commitments  A handful of companies are getting behind Sun Microsystems' push to promote its Solaris operating system on Intel-based servers. The server giant has gathered a slew of commitments and endorsements regarding its strategy. Among the companies that have committed to release software for the version of Solaris that runs on "x86" servers compatible with Intel chips are speech recognition software maker Nuance and computer performance-monitoring toolmaker Quantiva. In addition, e-commerce software maker BEA Systems is evaluating the Solaris version, Verizon is using it, and chipmaker AMD and database-software maker Sybase have endorsed it, said Ann Wettersten, the newly named vice president of marketing for Sun's operating systems group. Solaris for Intel processors has been riding a roller coaster at Sun for years, with the downs resulting from often frosty relations between Sun and Intel. Thursday's announcements are intended to show that Sun's current efforts to promote the product are taking hold. Sun for years has offered a version of Solaris for Intel servers, but it preferred to promote the much more widely used version for Sun's own UltraSparc processors. A year ago, Sun announced it was "deferring productization" of Solaris 9 for Intel servers, putting plans for the product on hold. Later in 2002, the company announced it would ship Solaris 9 for its LX50 Intel servers and eventually other systems as well. To make computing hardware useful, a computer maker must attract software companies. Sun has had strong partnerships for its UltraSparc version of Solaris, but for the x86 version, the company faces challenges in rounding up support. It's not alone, though. Intel and Hewlett-Packard are hard at work enlisting software company support for new Itanium systems, which work completely differently from Intel's more widely used Pentium and Xeon processors. Sun, with its Open Network Environment (Sun ONE) set of server software, isn't totally dependent on outside software companies. It's working on plans to release versions of all the UltraSparc-Solaris programs so they run on Intel-Solaris and Intel-Linux as well. Solaris 9 for x86-based servers includes the company's protective firewall software, its Volume Manager for managing disk storage systems, and its Resource Manager for allocating processing power and other computing resources for different computing tasks on a server. Solaris 9 is included with Sun Intel servers and otherwise costs at least $99. Telephone support costs $75 per year for desktop systems and $1,275 a year for low-end servers, Sun has said.
2003-10-23 - Sun Fujitsu eye tighter alliance   Sun Microsystems and Fujitsu, competitors with servers that are united by a common processor design and operating system, are in discussions that could mean a tighter alliance. Both companies said they are continuing discussions that have gone on for years but declined to offer details of the current talks. A source familiar with the discussions, however, said Thursday that negotiations for a closer alliance are taking place and that some partnership details could emerge next week as Fujitsu provides financial information. Japanese business newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported Wednesday that Sun and Fujitsu have agreed to integrate their high-performance server businesses. Sun spokeswoman Kasey Holman wouldn't confirm the report, but said that Sun Chief Executive Scott McNealy met with Fujitsu's chairman and former CEO Naoyuki Akikusa this week. The two companies already are deeply involved. Sun and Fujitsu both build Sparc processors--Fujitsu's Sparc64 and Sun's UltraSparc--that are used in separate server lines that run Sun's Solaris operating system. Both companies are members of the independent Sparc International group that determines common elements of Sparc chips, and both have extensive future chip plans. In addition, Fujitsu sells Sun's UltraSparc servers as its "S" line in Japan, even though it also has its own Sparc64-based PrimePower line and Sun uses Fujitsu keyboards and hard drives in its systems, said Fujitsu spokesman Mike Beirne. A broader alliance could take several forms. Among the options, Sun could simply be looking for a second partner besides Texas Instruments to build its processors; the companies could be sharing engineering resources; or they could be moving chip or server lines closer together. One certainty, though, is that financial analysts have been pressuring Sun to restructure to cut expenses and achieve profitability, and unifying processor or server work could achieve that end. "Joint development of the Sparc processor alone could save (Sun) $200 million annually, while joint development of Sparc and servers could potentially save $300 million to $400 million," Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a research note. The companies' statements were open-ended. "We're always looking for ways to expand and enhance our business relationship," Holman said. Fujitsu said that over the years, "the two companies have had a number of discussions about the benefits of working together," and while those discussions are continuing, "nothing has been decided with respect to expanding the scope of our current relationship with Sun." The source familiar with the discussions, though, said Fujitsu's position that an agreement hasn't been reached should be taken as "virtual confirmation that negotiations are under way." TI hasn't been notified of any changes in its partnership with Sun, TI spokesman Gary Silcott said. "Nothing's changing from our perspective. It's full speed ahead in terms of our supply relationship with Sun," Silcott said. One change has taken place, though, in Sun's chip group. Andy Ingram, who has been vice president of the company's processor and network products marketing, on Monday took over as vice president of marketing for Sun's storage group, Sun spokeswoman Sabrina Guttman confirmed Thursday. TI and Fujitsu both are working on next-generation microprocessor manufacturing technology. Current high-end processors have circuitry with physical features measuring 130 nanometers, but next-generation manufacturing will allow smaller 90-nanometer features. (A nanometer is a billionth of a meter; when chip features shrink, more circuitry can be squeezed onto a chip.) Fujitsu has been strong both in manufacturing and Sparc64 chip design, said Kevin Krewell, senior editor of Microprocessor Report. "Fujitsu has been pretty good at knocking off chips in a relatively short time frame," he said. "They've been able to get from design team formation to design out the door in two or two-and-a-half years, which is a lot shorter than Sun's been able to accomplish with its UltraSparc line." However, although "the 90-nanometer process Fujitsu is bringing to the market looks very good," Krewell thinks it "very unlikely" that Sun will drop TI. Technologically, Sun and Fujitsu's hardware isn't compatible at present. Although UltraSparc and Sparc64 chips understand the same instructions, it's impossible to plug one company's chips into the other's servers because the chips have different standards for the physical connection, he said. Further complicating the processor strategy is the fact that Fujitsu also has accepted Intel's high-end Itanium processor into its server line. "Fujitsu is riding a bunch of different horses at the same time. That takes a lot of resources, but so far, the company seems willing to do that," Krewell said.
2004-05-12 - Sun completes 'Niagara' chip design    Sun Microsystems has completed the design of its "Niagara" processor, a crucial product in the server maker's effort to keep its UltraSparc chip family competitive, a source familiar with the project said. Sun acquired the Niagara design when it bought start-up Afara Websystems in 2002. The processor is an element of Sun's UltraSparc family--an increasingly important part after Sun canceled two other UltraSparc models and embraced the rival "x86" chip lineage of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. The company "taped out" the Niagara design Tuesday, meaning that its design is done and has been sent to the chip fabrication facility for prototypes to be built and tested, the source said. A Sun representative confirmed the milestone. Typically, at least a year is required after tape-out to fix manufacturing and other issues before a chip actually can be used in a server. Niagara is notable for an unusual design that includes eight processing engines, or cores, each of which is capable of handling four instruction sequences called threads. Sun variously calls this approach "throughput computing" or "chip multithreading." Niagara and a higher-end cousin code-named Rock are still under development, but Sun canceled development of two other chips this year: the low-end Gemini model with dual UltraSparc II cores and the high-end UltraSparc V. At the same time, Sun is aggressively adopting AMD's Opteron processor. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company also is putting more emphasis on its software, which runs on both chip types and in the future also will run on competitors' servers with other processors. Texas Instruments builds Sun's processors. UltraSparc chips compete chiefly with IBM's Power processors, Intel's Itanium processors and Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC processors.
2004-11-18 - Sun changing course on Itanium plans--again    SAN JOSE, Calif.--Sun Microsystems doesn't want to bring its Solaris operating sytem to Intel's Itanium chip. This week. Sun dallied with bringing its Solaris operating system to Intel's Itanium processor, but Chief Executive Scott McNealy on Monday voiced second thoughts--or perhaps fourth thoughts is a more accurate description. Sun started Itanium support in the 1990s, canceled it in 2000, then floated the idea again in July. At a Solaris announcement event, McNealy updated the company's position. "We're not doing anything with Itanium," he said, to which President Jonathan Schwartz added, "There's just no volume." But there's still room for another change of heart. In his Web log Tuesday, Schwartz said Sun plans to announce "changes to its Itanium plans" next week.
2002-06-25 - Sun buys start-up to boost UltraSparc  SAN FRANCISCO--Sun Microsystems has signed an agreement to acquire chip design start-up Afara Websystems to bolster the UltraSparc processors at the heart of its business, a Sun executive said Tuesday. Afara, headquartered in San Jose, Calif., and backed by Sequoia Capital and Raza Foundries, had been working on a Sparc-compatible processor that boosts Internet data transfer speed and quality. The acquisition is expected to close in July, said David Yen, currently general manger of Sun's Processor Products Group but next in line to be promoted to executive vice president for processor products and network security products. He spoke with reporters Tuesday. Yen declined to detail acquisition terms or what Sun found interesting about the start-up, but he said the Afara technology will be incorporated into Sun's Sparc processors and that Sun will absorb Afara's engineering team. Sun, the leading company in the lucrative market for Unix servers, has a lot riding on its UltraSparc line. Yen spotlighted several other aspects of Sun's plans Tuesday. As reported, Sun's coming UltraSparc IV processor will run at speeds between 1.2GHz to 2GHz and will work in existing servers, Yen said. The UltraSparc V, with a dual personality to handle different types of workloads, will run from 1.8GHz to beyond 3GHz and will work only in new servers. Yen said the UltraSparc IV will be manufactured using tiny circuitry built on a 130-nanometer manufacturing process, while UltraSparc will use a 90-nanometer process. The nanometer measurement refers to the minimum size of components inside a chip. Smaller components are closer together, and it takes less time for data to move through and among them. Sun, based in Santa Clara, Calif., faces tremendous competition in the market for servers, the large networked computers that handle chores such as managing corporate financial accounts or constructing and sending Web pages to Internet browsers. IBM, the overall leader in servers, is applying sustained pressure on Sun's Unix server stronghold, while products from Hewlett-Packard, Dell Computer and IBM based on Intel processors have encroached on Sun's low-end systems. Facing the imminent arrival of Intel's Itanium 2 processor, expected in July, Sun is taking the offensive, breaking out the "road map" and showing some of what it has planned. Computing companies use such forward-looking road maps to convince customers, software companies, industry analysts and others that they have strong product plans. Sun didn't release a schedule for the UltraSparc improvements, but Yen said it's unlikely that 90-nanometer fabrication technology will be available before the end of 2003 or early 2004. And even then, Sun plans to move other, "less challenging" designs to the new manufacturing processes first, he said. Sun designed the original Sparc chips, but the chip's specifications are owned by the Sparc International nonprofit organization and available for anyone who spends the $90 licensing fee, Yen said. Afara was one such licensee. The challenge facing Sun and other chip designers is how to best use the increasing amounts of circuitry that can be squeezed onto a slice of silicon as manufacturing processes permit ever-smaller electronics, Yen said. Better than IBM, Intel? IBM's coming Power5 and Power6 processors will build more features currently handled by software into the processor, but Yen said that approach has drawbacks because it forces the chip to become too specialized. However, Sun does agree with some IBM design principles. It will move networking and encryption tasks now handled by software into the chip. And Sun will put multiple processors, often called "cores," on a single slice of silicon, a feature IBM pioneered for server processors with its Power4, which debuted in 2001. "You will see multicore in our processor design...where it looks like a good choice," Yen said. Intel, with its Itanium chip, is emphasizing the ability to run many instructions simultaneously, or "in parallel," but Yen said that approach is risky because it requires heavy software optimization to feed the chip conveniently packaged instructions. "We strongly feel UltraSparc V has an architecture which is more flexible and therefore superior to the Intel Itanium architecture, which was really motivated by late 1970s high-performance computing," Yen said. In that era, the basic assumption was a "maximum amount of parallelism," he said. Highlighting lower-end UltraSparcs Sun is best known for its high-end UltraSparc "s" line for large multiprocessor systems, but the company offers "i" systems for midrange servers and "e" systems for lower-end products. However, Sun is working on a new branding plan to make the lesser processors more prominent. "In order to support Sun's very wide system product portfolio, from the under-$1,000 low-end desktop or thin servers all the way to the multimillion-dollar mainframe class servers...we are developing a spectrum of processors with different trade-off points," Yen said. One key product is the UltraSparc IIIi, which likely will debut later this year. Where the UltraSparc III has 8MB of high-speed "cache" memory, the IIIi will have a smaller but faster 1MB cache that's on the same silicon as the chip instead of packaged separately, Yen said. Badmouthing benchmarks Yen said Sun is working to try to create measurements that better represent its chips' performance. Clock speed just isn't sufficient, he said, and neither are the current processor benchmarks from the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation--of which Sun is a member. Intel trumpeted high SPECint2000 and SPECfp2000 measurements for its coming Itanium 2 processor. But SPEC's tests no longer represent real-world performance, Yen said. In part, that's because the entire test software package now can fit into a chip's high-speed cache memory, rendering obsolete the need to fetch data from slower main memory. In real life, though, servers often have to use main memory. Customers "are not going to get the kind of performance they expected from reading the SPEC" benchmarks, Yen said. Sun's current UltraSparc III processors arrived much more slowly than the company had hoped, with consequent delays for the UltraSparc IV and V successors. But Sun's servers remain on top of the Unix server market; ample amounts of high-end software are written for them; and the company's profit margins are edging up as the retirement of most older UltraSparc II servers simplifies manufacturing and inventory. Although it's about to add servers based on Intel processors to its stable, Sun is a staunch advocate of its UltraSparc processors, the single most important component of its multibillion-dollar business selling high-powered computers. Sun has more than 1,400 designers working on its Sparc processors. Though Sun systems lead the Unix server market, UltraSparc processors aren't tops in performance. "I don't think Sun sells on the basis of performance," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. "The key issue for Intel is that Sun has such a substantial share of the market that Sun is a safe choice" for software companies deciding which processors to support. Clock speed isn't everything Intel, which always has been a leader in the race for faster processor clock rates, rose to its current status selling PCs but is increasingly emphasizing server and networking gear chips. Compared with PCs, those higher-performance systems have more discriminating buyers who recognize there's more to overall system performance than chip clock speed, including factors such as how fast data can be transferred within the system and how many instructions a chip can execute in a single tick of its clock. But Intel, with the NetBurst design in its Pentium 4 processors and their close Xeon relatives for servers, has emphasized clock speed more than ever. The company's argument is that NetBurst lays a foundation for steady clock speed advancement that frees designers to improve performance in other areas. Xeons for dual-processor workstations run today at 2.4GHz, while multiprocessor models top out at 1.6GHz. Lower-profile chips Sun also is working on lesser but still important chips than the flagship UltraSparc III, IV and V. For higher-end systems that ship in larger quantities than top-end products, Sun plans to introduce soon the UltraSparc IIIi at 1.1GHz and growing to 1.6GHz. Its successor will be the UltraSparc IVi, running from 1.1GHz to 2GHz. For lower-end "horizontal" systems that typically are bought in even larger quantities but don't cost as much, Sun will sell the UltraSparc IIIi from 1.1GHz to 1.4GHz before phasing in a "next generation" i series processor running from 1.5GHz to beyond 3GHz. The UltraSparc II line will live on longest in the "e" line of processors, used in Sun's slimmest servers and low-end workstations. The present 700MHz IIe will eventually be replaced by other IIe chips running at 900MHz to 1.1GHz, at which point next-generation "e" line products will be phased in running at speeds between 1GHz and 2GHz. Though Sun aims products such as its new four-processor V480 "Cherrystone" at Intel servers, much of its competition comes from IBM and HP Unix servers. IBM's p630, to be introduced Tuesday, brings its Power4 processor to comparatively inexpensive systems costing well under $50,000. HP, long the leader in midrange Unix servers, is hoping its partnership with Intel on Itanium systems will give it a major cost advantage over the likes of Sun. Texas Instruments builds the UltraSparc processors Sun designs.
2005-02-03 - Sun burnishes next-gen Sparc chips SANTA CLARA, Calif.--Sun Microsystems said Wednesday it will pass a significant development milestone in 2005 for two follow-on models of the company's forthcoming processor, code-named Niagara. Those successors include a second-generation Niagara chip and the "Rock" processor, due to arrive in systems in 2008. Rock employs some of Niagara's technology for running multiple jobs at once but is designed for more-demanding, higher-end tasks. At the company's annual meeting for analysts here, Sun Chief Executive Scott McNealy said both chips are maturing. "We'll be taping out Rock this year, as well as the second version of Niagara this year," McNealy said. Tape-out is the stage at which chip engineers ship their design--recorded on magnetic tapes--to the chip factory for fabrication. In the nearer term will be Niagara. David Yen, executive vice president of Sun's scalable systems group, demonstrated a Niagara system here running a Java program on Solaris 10. Sun now is producing several Niagara test systems per week for internal testing, Yen said. Sun is aggressively promoting servers using x86 processors, chiefly Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron. But it also is working to ensure the Sparc lineage keeps a place alongside x86, IBM's Power and Intel's Itanium. Sun has had some problems in its processor business. For example, in 2004 it canceled is much-delayed UltraSparc V processor, which had been inauspiciously code-named Millennium, and its UltraSparc III arrived years late. But Niagara seems to be going better, said Kevin Krewell, editor in chief of the Microprocessor Report. "The first silicon is working exceptionally well," Krewell said. Niagara servers are due to arrive in the first quarter of 2006, said Marc Tremblay, chief architect of Sun's scalable systems group. A new chip approach Niagara will be the first major debut of a technology called chip multithreading (CMT), which is designed to let processors work more efficiently. With this approach, multiple computing engines called processor cores are combined on the same chip, and each core can juggle multiple instruction sequences called threads. Today's processors spend much of their time waiting to retrieve data from memory. When Sun chips run into that problem, a new thread takes over while the first waits for data. Niagara, with eight cores each able to run four threads, can run a total of 32 threads in parallel. Today's software will work on CMT chips, but must be optimized to work well, Yen said. "For example, internally in our system software, there are places where we may have limited the parallelism only to four simultaneous threads or eight," he said. "Now, knowing that even one processor can support 32 simultaneous threads, certainly we'd like to further enhance the parallelism." "By the time we release the product, we will have real customer testimonials." --David Yen,Sun VP As expected, Yen said that Sun plans to let programmers use publicly available Niagara servers to help this optimization. "Later in this year, probably in the summer time frame, we plan to build 40 or 50 additional machines connected to the network and provide a more public access to such platforms," Yen said. "By the time we release the product, we will have real customer testimonials." Niagara is built with a manufacturing process that employs features as small as 90 nanometers, or billionths of a meter. Niagara II and Rock will be built with a 65-nanometer process, which permits more circuitry to be squeezed onto the same amount of silicon. Sun inked a partnership with Fujitsu, the other major Sparc processor designer, to design joint systems called the Advanced Product Line, or APL, that will go on sale in 2006. The first such systems will be based on Niagara, but a second phase of the collaboration will use Fujitsu's Olympus processor. The Olympus systems will hold up to 64 processors, Yen said. The Olympus chip has two cores that each handle two threads. Leaning on AMD Hector Ruiz, Advanced Micro Devices' chief executive, joined McNealy on Wednesday to tout the companies' partnership. Sun now is the partner responsible for the most sales of Opteron chips, Ruiz said. McNealy said Sun will aggressively promote AMD's dual-core Opteron processors, which boosts computing power by combining two processing engines into one single slice of silicon. That chip is still on schedule to arrive this year, Ruiz said, but offered an optimistic footnote about the schedule. "We're doing all the engineering and development. We've seen it," Ruiz said. "Officially, we intend to be launching it in the marketplace around the summertime. Sometimes things happen and you might do better." The AMD deal helped relieve pressures on Sun's engineering budget, Yen said. "If Sun doesn't have an Opteron-based product, I very well may have to invest and develop a low-end, low-cost Sparc processor playing the same role as the Opteron or (Intel) Xeon," Yen said. More is coming from the AMD deal. Later this year, Sun plans to release high-end Opteron servers based on designs from Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim and to refresh midrange storage products with Opteron chips.
2001-06-25 - Stratus debuts delayed Windows server  High-end-server maker Stratus Technologies will take a step into the low-end market Monday when it introduces its first machine using Intel chips and Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating system. Stratus sells high-end, crash-resistant machines for jobs such as running 911 emergency call systems or ATM networks, where the operators can't afford to have a machine go down. To ensure that its servers are reliable, the company uses carefully tested software and backup hardware components--"redundant" components--that keep running if the primary unit fails. Until now, the 1,100-employee, Maynard, Mass.-based company has used Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC chips in systems that ran either the HP-UX version of Unix or Stratus' VOS operating system. These systems typically cost $200,000 to $300,000, said Chief Executive Steve Kiely. The new Intel and Windows-based ftServer 5200, though, will start at $28,000, with typical models costing in the mid-$30,000 range, Kiely said. This price difference will let the company tackle customers looking for affordable systems to handle less-critical jobs such as e-mail. The cheaper price tag means the company expects to earn more revenue from the Windows machines than from its other lines in the fiscal year ending Feb. 28, 2002, Kiely said. The profits will change over the year after that, he said. But the system is late: The company said last year that the ftServer would arrive in September 2000. "It wasn't ready," Kiely said. "It was more important to have it absolutely perfect than it was to ring the bell on time to market." Stratus, long a niche player, will face heavy competition as it tries to move into the Intel server domain dominated by giants such as Dell Computer and Compaq Computer. Sun Microsystems could provide a challenge, too, as it cuts prices on its own Unix servers. Stratus' plan, though, is to sign "original equipment manufacturing" partnerships so these potential rivals will sell the Stratus systems under their own brands, Kiely said. The company has trumpeted one such deal, with NEC in Japan, and it has others up its sleeve, Kiely said. "We have OEM partners signed on in Japan. In the U.S., we have a couple signed up but not announced," he said. It can be tough for niche players, though. Network Engines, which pioneered superthin two-processor servers, is beseiged now that major server makers have their own designs. And Unisys has been struggling to spread its high-end CMP server design. The ftServer 5200 is a four-processor machine, though double- and triple-redundant components mean it's actually built with eight or 12 CPUs. The system uses Intel's latest server chip, the "Foster" Xeon model based on the Pentium 4 design. More ftServer models are on the way. The lower-end ftServer 3200, co-developed by NEC, is expected in July. That system is a two-processor setup, with only double redundancy available. And in late 2002 or early 2003, the company will release a model using the second-generation version of Intel's top-end Itanium CPU, Kiely said. The company also will use Windows 2002--the server successor to Windows 2000--on which Stratus has been working in conjunction with Microsoft. "We want to make the operating system as indifferent as possible to changes in hardware state," Kiely said. That would include changes that make it easier to swap out hardware components without shutting down the machine, he said. Stratus, though privately owned, is profitable, Kiely said. Though the spending downturn has hurt the company and spurred expense cuts, no layoffs were required, he said. "We're hoping (the market) will recover in the second half. We're optimistic, but not betting on it," Kiely said. "We had enough of a cushion in operating margin that we're...not reducing staff."
2002-10-15 - Straight talk on Web services  When it comes to Web services, Rajiv Gupta intimately knows the meaning of first-mover disadvantage. The co-creator of Hewlett Packard's ill-fated E-speak, one of the earliest versions of what would become known as Web services, Gupta lived through the frustration of being early to market with a new--even grandiose--computing vision. With the passage of time, information technology shops have come to have a far clearer idea about what Web services are. But when it comes to convincing corporate chief information officers what it can do for their businesses, Gupta, now CEO of Web services start-up Confluent, believes technologists continue to commit a cardinal mistake. "We should be selling Web services within the context of what the customer needs," he says. "But we're becoming too technology-specific and enamored of the technology." That's become even more of an issue at a time when chief financial officers are reluctant to sign off on "iffy" big technology implementations, he added. CNET News.com talked recently with Gupta, who will officially unveil Confluent to the public later this month. Q: You were the co-inventor and general manager of Hewlett-Packard's E-speak. I guess one might argue that you guys were ahead of the curve in Web services. But why did E-speak fizzle? A: It was my baby. There were a number of different reasons for its failure; I made a bunch of mistakes, HP made a bunch of mistakes. And as you said, we were early--especially in the technology. Sometimes it's more of a curse to come out early than to come out late. My mistake: I focused more on the technology than on the business context in which the technology would be applied. It's a classic mistake that people make, and I fell into the same trap. I'm seeing that (mistake) being made by others today. So, for example, we focused on the architecture being very plain and rich, but didn't focus as much on usability. We focused on changing the world, but focused less on helping the world see the value. We didn't appreciate the fact that the world wanted to change not as fast as we wanted to move. Was it a curse to be out ahead of everybody? Much too much is made of first-mover advantage. It's probably as much a disadvantage as an advantage. Sometimes it's more of a curse to come out early than to come out late. What about HP? Where did it go wrong on Web services? HP didn't really appreciate what it takes to set an industry standard, especially in software. It was a market where we didn't have the credibility that HP has in printers. So we very naively put our software out there as open source. We thought that was sufficient but we didn't pay enough attention to building consensus and partnerships and driving those standards. Still, the vision and strategy and technology were right on. Now I just have to make sure that we don't make the same mistake again. Was it something to do with the pre-Carly Fiorina culture at HP? Some of it, yes. We were very much like a box company--whether it was boxes that spat out dots on paper or blinking lights. What's to prevent Web services from suffering a similar fate? If it's not helping the return on their investments, IT managers don't want to hear about big new expensive projects. Precisely. It's the people who have the burned fingers who, having made mistakes before, won't make them again. With E-speak, we didn't pay much attention to standards but today, all the players are paying homage to the same set of standards. The downside is that many players are not paying as much attention to the business context and singing the praises of the technology. That has to change. People are not as willing to open their wallets, because they have technology indigestion and they are not as willing to listen to a new technology story. What do you think is the biggest misconception about what Web services can do for IT? It's being sold as a panacea, and that is a mistake because you don't want (users) to get cynical too early. There is a place for Web services...where they can and should be applied. We should be selling Web services within the context of what the customer needs. But we're becoming too technology-specific and enamored of the technology. Are there still problems with scalability, as Web services gains acceptance on enterprise deployments? No, I think that is an implementation maturity. Does CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) have transactional maturity? It's how you implement it. The technology by itself doesn't hurt or help you. The same is true for Web services. How about security? It is an issue. To me, it's more a security-management issue than security itself. It's how to manage security policy--that is the bigger issue. It's more to do with visibility and control across the board. Where does the technology need to go next? Is it a question of setting standards or some other kind of hurdle? Yes, there's a need for standards, and some of the standards are in the process of being adopted and defined. But there is enough standards and technology out there already for us to do serious deployments. I think there's just a maturity issue. The economy is in a funk and spending--well, it ain't 1999. Is that going to slow the proliferation of Web services? Overall, you're right. People are not as willing to open their wallets, because they have technology indigestion and they are not as willing to listen to a new technology story. In this environment, you don't need to hook up to 2,000 dot-coms. But for companies that understand they need to get operational efficiency of existing investments, this could be very good for them. Confluent is launching at the end of this month. You really picked one heck of a time to start a new company. This is either the best time to start a new company, or it could be the worst time. You were one of lead architects for Itanium. Why did it take so long for the project to get completed, and why do you think it's not selling? When I first started work on the HP project, my intent was to kill Intel, not partner with Intel. At the time, (Itanium) was to come out in 1993. Obviously, it has taken much longer than originally imagined. With Itanium, too many things moved at the same time--a new architecture, new compilers, etc.--so that had its effect on the delay. By the way, I think working with Intel was the right thing to do. I spent a lot of time bringing Intel up to speed--there were a number of issues. It will take time (for Itanium to succeed). The unfortunate part is that in this economy, time is not a friend. But in terms of its raw capability, I think over time it will be a success. The new (Itanium) already is much faster than any other processor on the market. Now the question is how valuable that additional speed will be in this economy.
1999-11-15 - STOCKS TO WATCH Intel Microsoft and Vodafone   Expect the following technology stocks to be among Monday's most actively traded issues: Intel, Microsoft, Priceline and Vodafone. Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC) Intel figures to see its typically high volume Monday after Friday's downgrade from Merrill Lynch. The chipmaker's shares fell 3 1/4 to 76 3/16 Friday after analyst Joseph Osha cut the stock from a "buy" recommendation to a near-term "accumulate" rating, citing increased competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NYSE: AMD) and the possibility of slower-than-expected adoption of its Itanium chip next year. "AMD was the straw that broke the camel's back," Osha told Reuters. "There have been problems, problems and more problems gathering that made it harder for me to defend the rating." He cut his price target on the stock to $90 from $100. He also trimmed the outlook for fiscal 2000 earnings per share to $2.55 from $2.69. With the arrival of AMD's Athlon chip, Intel will now have competition for its Pentium III at the high-end of the consumer and corporate PC sector. Up until now, AMD's Intel-compatible chips have targeted the low-cost PC market. Intel shares hit a 52-week high of 89 1/2 in September. Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) Microsoft shares will be moving as usual Monday, especially after Bill Gates was quoted as saying he insisted on the right to determine what goes into the company's widely used Windows operating system. Gates was interviewed by Time news magazine after a federal judge ruled last week Microsoft was a monopoly that had bullied rivals and hurt consumers by stifling competition, a ruling that analysts said could have drastic consequences including a possible break-up of the company. "We'd love to resolve this thing, and we're going to be pragmatic about it," Gates told Time when asked if he was ready to settle. But Gates said he could not agree to a settlement that restricted what new applications could be added to Windows. "Let's face it. Without innovation, given the intense competition out there, Windows would become irrelevant. Not only would that be a tragedy for the shareholders, it would be a tragedy for consumers.'' But Gates refused to be drawn into discussing details of a possible settlement. "The only thing that we know for sure that would be ad for consumers is anything that blocked us from being able to innovate Windows or anything that made is so that when people buy Windows they don't know what is in it. "Beyond those two principles, we'll be as pragmatic as we can," Gates said. Its shares closed off 7/16 to 89 3/16 Friday. Priceline.com Inc. (Nasdaq: PCLN) Ford Motor Co. will announce plans to let visitors to its Web site negotiate prices for new cars using Priceline.com's online bidding system, in the first deal of its kind between the Internet company and a car manufacturer, the Wall Street Journal said Monday. Ford will direct Internet users who look up prices for new Ford automobiles on its Web site to Priceline, where they can bid on the vehicles. Ford will pay Priceline an undisclosed amount to conduct the test, Priceline said.  Vodafone Airtouch Plc. (NYSE: VOD) Vodafone made a hostile takeover bid for German telecommunications and engineering company Mannesmann AG. So far, it's been unsuccessful. Sources close to the company said the all-stock bid was valued at more than $100 billion. Mannesmann AG said on Sunday it had rejected the unsolicited offer, saying it had turned down a Vodafone share exchange offer in which Vodafone proposed swapping 43.7 of its shares for a single Mannesmann share. It described the proposed deal as "financially extremely unattractive." Vodafone shares closed off 4 and change Friday to 47 3/8.>
2003-01-15 - Start-up greases wheels of business    Start-up Intalio will next week debut new software to help automate business processes, entering a market segment that is poised for growth, according to analysts. The company, one of a handful of business process management (BPM) software specialists, has developed software to model and build programs to automate complex processes such as product manufacturing and acquisition of raw materials. BPM software includes tools to model and build systems and to link these to existing databases and other business applications. Intalio's product, called Intalio N3, or "N cubed," consists of application development tools and a server that executes programs through different stages of a multistep business process. For example, one of the company's two customers, Lexis-Nexis, is using Intalio N3 to create information services for small and medium-sized businesses that draw on data from multiple sources. Business process management is fast becoming a hotly contested software category, said analysts. BPM products can help corporations integrate their existing data and applications into new business systems. Software companies claim that BPM software allows customers to more quickly react to changing market conditions by using process models to design and build more flexible applications. But BPM software doesn't come cheap. However, despite generally stingy IT spending, analysts are bullish on the prospects for BPM software. In a survey of 200 organizations last year, the Delphi Group found that a majority of those companies planning BPM projects expected to spend between $100,000 and $500,000. IT research firm the Delphi Group expects that the global BPM market to top $5 billion in 2004. Part of what's driving the interest in BPM is a growing focus on streamlining business processes to ultimately save money, said Benoit Gaucherin, chief technology officer at systems integration and consulting company Sapient. He said that business people have yet to embrace business-modeling tools in a significant way, but he does see usage growing. Intalio, which built its product around the idea of integrating applications and modeling business processes, represents one of several companies in the BPM market. The company and fellow BPM software makers Fuego and Savvion argue that they are ahead in terms of technology development, yet they face competition from a host of other software providers. In a December 2002 ranking of BPM companies, Forrester Research placed Intalio within the "strong performers" category, but noted that there are no clear leaders yet in the market. Software workflow companies, which historically built systems for document management, have beefed up their products with better application integration. Integration middleware companies have added modeling and development tools for BPM. And application server companies such as IBM, BEA Systems and Microsoft also have products that fit into the category. Version 2 of Intalio N3 introduces a programming application for building Web front-ends to business applications, a more robust server with added support for clustering, and better connectivity to packaged enterprise applications. The upgrade also allows companies to use a modeled business process in more than one application development project.
2003-04-14 - SQL Server races against competition   When Microsoft launches its 64-bit version of SQL Server at the end of April, the database will cost the same as the 32-bit version, perform better, and be part of the company's bid to oust Oracle and IBM's DB/2 on high-end systems. SQL Server is widely regarded as suitable for smaller systems, while larger databases are the province of Oracle or DB/2 running on RISC systems. However, Microsoft has been quietly creeping up the rankings, and in March a prelaunch version of 64-bit SQL Server reached No. 2 in the nonclustered TPC-C benchmark performance table running on an NEC Itanium 2 mainframe. "We are not stopping at number two," said Mitch Gatchalian, product manager for SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition, which is the 64-bit version. "Last year in October, we came in at No. 6, and have ramped up quickly to reach No. 2. Sixty four-bit Itanium 2 will be a big turning point." Microsoft already tops the league in clustered performance and for benchmarks where the number of processors is limited. Gatchalian pointed out that when price per transaction is taken into account, Microsoft gains considerably. The biggest advantage of Itanium over x86 processors is the addressable memory. Although 16 exabytes--one exabyte equals one billion gigabytes--is more than anyone needs right now, the fact that it can directly address more than the 4GB limitation of 32-bit systems means it can perform database manipulations in memory easily without paging to disk, Gatchalian said. The 64-bit version will be offered to existing Microsoft customers and users of other databases. "We have a high level of compatibility with the existing SQL Server database," he said. "The SQL code is compatible, and the database file format is the same. You simply detach from the 32-bit server and re-attach." Pricing the 64-bit version the same as the 32-bit version is intended to ease the upgrade. "Customers who have budgeted for SQL server don't have to go back and ask for more money." However, Gatchalian did not address the issue that a 64-bit database will require a more expensive 64-bit operating system and 64-bit hardware on which to run. SQL Server still has a very small market share at the high end, Gatchalian concedes, but he claims that many RISC customers are coming to him asking to migrate, to get better performance and lower cost. "There is a significant market out there in high-scale servers systems that Microsoft and Intel has not tapped." RISC is computer architecture that reduces chip complexity by using simpler instructions. At the high end, there are fewer new databases set up, so much of the business must come from migration. Microsoft has offered tools and guides to move data into SQL Server--and these will work just as well for the 64-bit version, said Gatchalian, because of the compatibility between the versions. He gave no predictions of SQL Server's market share in the 64-bit space. "It depends on how aggressively Intel sells 64-bit," he said. "Itanium has had a slow start, but Itanium 2 will be a sharp curve. We are at the bottom part of that curve now." ZDNet UK's Peter Judge reported from San Francisco.
2005-06-10 - Spotlight Newscom readers on Apple and Microsoft   June is supposed to be a slow month for news, but things definitely heated up this week when Apple Computer confirmed that it would switch to Intel processors, while Microsoft unveiled a slew of initiatives at its annual TechEd conference. The Apple-Intel deal brought the most reactions from News.com readers, but other issues also prompted spirited responses. Here's a sampling of more interesting opinions for the week. (Note: Readers' names could be pseudonyms.) "Your loyal customers are worried right now. Can you keep the same high standards for design, stability, security and ease of use? Is this going to hurt the developers? What about the price?" -- Andrew Harden "No really, this is not good. Undoubted long-term, core strategic error. God, he could at least have gone with the Opteron... Demmit, Jobs, what were you thinking of?" -- Andy Asdasda "I'm a bit relieved that this news came before I could buy a PowerBook." -- Onizuka "Just because Apple switched to Intel doesn't mean that our choices are relegated to AMD and Intel. Amiga is almost complete in its transition to PowerPC." -- Dennis Catt "Well, it looks like this will be my last Apple computer. I have been buying Apple Macintosh Computers since the Mac Plus came out, but I won't buy a computer with an Intel processor ever." -- Roy Clarke "It's just a processor. Intel wasn't the one who lost the antitrust lawsuit. That was Microsoft, not Intel. What's your beef with Intel?" --Miket A few readers also theorized that Apple could become a customer for the long-suffering Itanium processor. "Itanium is a far superior CPU architecture and Apple's OS X running on Itanium makes much more sense and Apple gets the added benefit of kicking sand in IBM's face. I would buy an Itanium workstation running OS X." -- Charles Nelson Click here to read more responses about Apple's Intel maneuver. Banter about Ballmer Readers also responded to an interview with Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who sounded off on a perceived pickup on IT spending, why students should choose IT careers, and competing with Red Hat. Readers said: "The IT world is getting worse and worse due to the total ignorance of IT management and their lack of common sense and reality. Just like all the BS Ballmer was putting out. Hell, these people can't stop a Blue Screen on their own operating system." -- CR Black, Orlando, Fla. "I predict that Longhorn, when it is released, will be the end-all, be-all of computer operating systems. Longhorn will deliver dynamic convergence and optimize cutting-edge networks while incubating next-generation action-items...In case you are totally clueless, I am being sarcastic." -- Anonymous "Look, Ballmer is just doing his job, his responsibility is to the stockholders and the company, love him or despise him or laugh at him, you have to admit, he does his company good... Eventually, it will learn how to play nice with everyone else. Then everyone will go on continuing to be annoyed at Michael Robertson." -- Kevin Kunreuther Click here to read more responses to the Ballmer interview. In other Microsoft news, one reader actually complimented Microsoft for acting to shore up recruiting problems: "(H)ats-off to MS for being vulnerable enough to let the truth be known. At least when we know the truth we have the opportunity to address the issue--no matter how ugly." -- Dennis SmithKeeping tabs on IE Some changes that Microsoft made to Internet Explorer--specifically, the addition of tabbed browsing--also fired up the Firefox faithful, as well as those genuinely interested in seeing Redmond improve its ubiquitous browser. "I recently installed the toolbar. 1. It doesn't let me choose if I want to install the indexing service (I already have google desktop running) 2. The tab feature seems unstable. Each time you open a new tab my screen goes blank for a second, and the taskbar menu reference suddenly changes (apparently the folks at MS are still opening up new IE windows when you create a tab, they're just hiding them now) I opted to uninstall. I'll continue to use Firefox for the time being." -- Amhed Herrera "I've just tried the MSN Searchbar for the tabs in IE and was dissapointed. There are no options to setup how and when new tabs are opened. It is nowhere near as good as Firefox's tab interface. Nice try MSN but it still needs work." -- David Langdon "No where near as nice as the tabs in Firefox. If you right click a link, it don't even offer you the option of opening it in a new tab, only a new window. I don't even think this is even truely 'Tabbed browing'. When you switch between tabs, the window and startbar flashes and then changes. I think all it does is opens them in new windows, but hides them and the tabs are nothing but links to the new windows. So what's the point in that?" -- Gregory Miller Click here to read more responses to Microsoft's browser work. Patent pros and cons Patents also took heat, though not from everyone: "The patent system is screwed up just like everything else ours any one else's government sticks their fingers in to. The greed and stupidity runs too deep for anything done by such governments to be anything other than screwed up." --Robert Barnett, following an $8.9 million patent verdict against Microsoft "Patents are the brakes of innovation. And the lawyers are in the driver's seat." --Gerald Ter Beke, regarding a Congressional patent reform proposal "Seeing the right-wing, corporate lapdog who wrote the bill and the cast of characters who are raving about it, I can bet that this bill will be an utter disaster for small inventors." --Mac fan Dave
2006-08-17 - Sparc-on-Intel translator due in weeks SAN FRANCISCO--Transitive, a start-up specializing in software that translates software for one chip so it can run on another, plans to release software this quarter so programs for Sun Microsystems' Sparc chips can be used on Intel Xeon chips. Transitive demonstrated the software this week at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo here. Intel, which for years has vied to lure UltraSparc customers to its own chips, announced a partnership in March to help Transitive with the work. The Los Gatos, Calif.-based start-up plans to begin selling the Xeon version of the Sparc translation software in the third quarter, said product manager Frank Weigel. The company also demonstrated a version of the software to run Sparc on Intel Itanium chips, a product that will go on sale in the fourth quarter, Weigel said. Both use Linux instead of Sun's Solaris operating system. The products mark a new phase in Transitive's history: software that one company can use to compete against another. Previous versions of the company's QuickTransit software have been used to help companies through internal chip transitions: Apple Computer's switch from PowerPC to Intel x86 chips; Silicon Graphics' switch from its MIPS chips to Itanium; and, announced this week, IBM's attempt to bring x86 Linux software to its own Power processors. Transitive's software works by translating instructions for one chip into the equivalent instructions another chip can understand. Frequently used instructions are cached so they needn't be translated again each time they're used. Weigel asserted that QuickTransit performs well. Sparc-Solaris software generally runs faster on Xeon-Linux using Transitive's software than on machines with Sun's 1.5GHz UltraSparc IV+ chips. The company's LinuxWorld demonstrations featured Transitive running Sparc-Solaris versions of Sybase and Oracle database software. In some cases, the software was running within a virtual machine, a compartment with its own operating system created with EMC's VMware software. Weigel said he didn't expect customers would use Transitive's software for their performance-sensitive central applications but would be more likely to do so when it comes to secondary code. And Transitive includes software that lets Linux run the custom scripts that people wrote to automate Solaris tasks, Weigel added.
2004-07-28 - Space agency taps SGI Intel for supercomputer  NASA has picked computer maker Silicon Graphics Inc. and chipmaker Intel to develop a major supercomputer based on Linux to simulate space exploration and conduct other research, SGI announced Tuesday. The computer company said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to integrate twenty 512-processor SGI Altix systems using Intel's Itanium 2 processors. With an eventual 10,240 processors, the Space Exploration Simulator will be among the world's largest supercomputers based on the Linux operating system, the company said. The machine, to be housed at the Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, will likely be one of the most powerful supercomputers. It will have twice as many processors as the machine from NEC now ranked No. 1 on a list of the 500 fastest supercomputers. The new supercomputer is part of a NASA collaboration with SGI and Intel called "Project Columbia," which is intended to lead to breakthroughs in space exploration, global-warming research and aerospace engineering, SGI said. "The exploration of the universe remains one of man's greatest challenges," Intel CEO Craig Barrett said in a statement. "The 'Project Columbia' supercomputer, designed by NASA, SGI and Intel, will enable the world's brightest designers and scientists to look a little deeper and reach a little farther in their understanding of, and achievements in, space." Officials from NASA said the new machine will increase the agency's supercomputing capacity about tenfold. NASA will spend about $45 million on computer gear for the project over three years, the officials said. The deal represents a victory not only for SGI and Intel but for the Linux operating system. Historically, supercomputers have been monolithic machines based on proprietary technology from companies such as Cray and IBM. But a number of companies have been assembling powerful computers by linking machines that use chips from Intel and the Linux open-source operating system. Until now, SGI's largest-announced Linux cluster had been a 1,024-processor system being built for the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. The NASA agreement also further cements the role of Itanium 2 processors in the high-performance computing market. A supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory based on 4,096 of the processors holds the second-place spot on the so-called Top500 list. In the new supercomputer, each 512-processor system will run its own copy of Linux and connect to the others with an InfiniBand switch from Voltaire. SGI historically built computers using its MIPS processor and Irix version of the Unix operating system, but it's been making a gradual transition to Itanium and Linux. Although it continues to supply MIPS-Irix systems to existing customers, most of the company's growth and attention is tied to the Itanium-Linux products, SGI spokeswoman Ginny Babbitt said. SGI said it has already delivered the first three of the new Altix systems to NASA's Ames Center, with the entire supercomputing array to be completed in the next several months.

2003-06-24 - Slowest Madison Itanium to run at 13GHz    The slowest of Intel's upcoming "Madison" generation of Itanium 2 processors will run at 1.3GHz, sources close to the company said Tuesday. This version of the processor will come with 3MB of high-speed cache memory. Intel is scheduled to formally debut the new Madison collection June 30, but declined to comment for this story. In the past, Intel has said higher-end versions of Madison will run at 1.5Ghz and come with 6MB of cache--thus the name Itanium 2 6M. The "McKinley" generation of Itaniums, currently being shipped, have as much as 3MB of cache and are called Itanium 2 3M. Intel will distinguish the 3MB Madison from the 3MB McKinley by appending the 1.3GHz clock speed to the end of the new chip's name, according to a source familiar with the plan.

2006-09-08 - SGI's Unix variant fading into history Silicon Graphics will phase out its Irix operating system and the MIPS chip-based computers the Unix variant runs on at the end of the year, 18 years after the once-vaunted computing company introduced the technology. "After nearly two decades of leading the world in innovation and versatility, the MIPS-Irix products will end their general availability on Dec. 29, 2006," SGI said on its Web site. SGI will still sell some systems "through special arrangement only" after that, and support will last through at least December 2013, the company said. The move isn't a surprise. SGI has been moving its product line to Intel's Itanium processors and the Linux operating system in recent years. But it does mark the end of another chapter as the computing industry whittles down the list of hardware and software foundations in widespread use. SGI rose to glory with high-end machines, particularly those suited to graphics work such as the creation of dinosaur special-effects for the movie "Jurassic Park." But SGI has struggled financially as mainstream computing equipment grew more powerful, and business-focused companies such as Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Dell and IBM turned their attention to high-performance computing. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company isn't the only one whose products fell victim to industry consolidation. Compaq Computer, shortly before its acquisition by Hewlett-Packard, decided to cancel its Alpha processors and bring its Tru64 version of Unix to Itanium. After the acquisition, HP decided to scrap Tru64 altogether. HP's version of Unix, HP-UX, is still actively developed, but HP is moving it to Itanium as the company phases out its own PA-RISC chips. Meanwhile, Linux, an open-source alternative that closely resembles Unix, has risen to prominence in part because it runs on mainstream x86 processors such as Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron. The three major versions of Unix that still are under active development are HP's HP-UX, Sun Microsystems' Solaris and IBM's AIX; of those, only Solaris runs on x86 chips. Among other versions of Unix that have fallen by the wayside in recent years are Sequent's Dynix/ptx, which vanished after IBM bought the company; Data General's DG/UX, which disappeared along with the Aviion server it used after EMC acquired the company; and Fujitsu-Siemens' Reliant. The SCO Group's two Unix versions, OpenServer and UnixWare, have been steadily dwindling in popularity, though the company continues to market the products. SCO's product revenue dropped from $7.9 million in the quarter that ended July 31, 2005, to $6.2 million in the same quarter this year, the company said this week. SCO is suing IBM, alleging that proprietary Unix intellectual property was improperly incorporated into open-source Linux.
2003-07-14 - SGI uses ATI for graphics behemoths    Silicon Graphics on Monday introduced a new high-end visualization machine that marks a major change for the company: reliance on mainstream video technology from ATI Technologies. The new Onyx4 UltimateVision system uses ATI workstation video cards instead of the SGI-designed graphics systems the company has relied on for years, said Shawn Underwood, marketing director for SGI's visual systems. The systems start at less than $45,000. But in high-end configurations with 64 of SGI's MIPS 16000A processors, they cost well over $300,000. "We've been waiting for the commodity suppliers to provide the key features we needed for visualization. This round of chips is really the first time they've had the image quality and the performance we need to put these into a high-performance architecture," said Guy Russell, a senior manger of SGI's Onyx team. SGI competitors that have embraced mainstream graphics technology include IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Quantum 3d and Evans & Sutherland, said Jon Peddie of Tiburon, Calif.-based consultancy Jon Peddie Research. "The era of proprietary graphics for workstations has almost disappeared," Peddie said. The new SGI system's performance will be five times better than its predecessor, while the price-performance ratio will be 40 times better, Russell said. "It's right on the mark. It's going to deliver the kind of performance and price performance that the industry wants," Peddie said. "It's going to make Quantum3D and Evans & Sutherland uncomfortable." But being able to take advantage of mainstream technology is a double-edged sword. For example, SGI is losing customers such as DreamWorks, which found that HP's workstations with conventional technology were good enough for the job. And SGI has been struggling financially, announcing a 400-employee layoff in May. SGI's systems are more than just graphics cards, though. Its systems have high-speed internal connections to make sure the main processors can keep the graphics cards busy. The systems are used for graphically challenging chores such as looking at oil field computer models, reviewing new car designs or simulating military combat. Even Procter&Gamble has used them to visualize airflow over Pringle's potato chips to maximize the speed they can be packed in cans without crumbling. One customer for the new Onyx4 is Los Alamos National Laboratory, which bought a customized 80-processor system as part of its program to simulate nuclear weapons explosions and the effects of aging in order to guarantee warheads will detonate when intended and won't when not. That system will be able to handle screens with 120 million pixels--the picture elements that make up computer screen images--and will be able to draw 40 billion pixels per second, SGI said. SGI has retrenched to its graphics specialty after an ambitious but failed attempt to expand into markets for general-purpose servers and Windows workstations. As part of its restructuring plans to scale back, SGI transferred some employees to ATI rival Nvidia. "If you look at the makeup of Nvidia and ATI, there's a lot of SGI people at both. We don't have any particular allegiance," Underwood said. "The basic building blocks of our architecture use the cards as an industry-standard, off-the-shelf product. If a year from now it makes more sense to do it with an Nvidia card, we can do that," he added. SGI isn't the only company to incorporate conventional graphics cards. While Sun and HP still maintain their proprietary in-house designs, those companies also use standard technology from ATI, Nvidia and 3DLabs, Peddie said. One drawback of moving to mainstream graphics cards is that some customers have written their own software with support for SGI graphics systems that use extensions to graphics standards. But SGI is continuing with some support for its own VPro graphics line. It announced a new four-processor workstation called the Tezro. That system will cost $20,500 for an entry-level, single-processor version, with a four-processor model costing $40,500, said Dixie Fisher, senior marketing manager of the workstations group. SGI's systems use the company's Irix version of the Unix operating system running on MIPS processors at 600MHz or 700MHz, with future speed increases planned, SGI said. The company also has begun selling a Linux-based system called the Altix 3000 that uses Intel's Itanium processor. While SGI once had planned to move completely to Itanium chips, it backed off and now plans a two-pronged processor strategy for the foreseeable future. Supporting MIPS may be expensive, but it's a necessity for SGI as it seeks to hang on to longtime customers with software written for the systems, Peddie said. "They're stuck. They have to" do it, he said. "There are billions of lines of code on those processors."
2003-04-15 - SGI updates midrange Unix server   SGI announced Tuesday its Origin 350 Unix server, a descendant of the two-year-old Origin 300 that has more new processors, additional memory capacity and faster input-output capability. The system can be purchased with between two and 32 processors and with as many as 62 PCI-X slots for plugging in high-bandwidth devices such as Fibre Channel or gigabit Ethernet network cards. It can accommodate as much as 64GB of memory. Like the Origin 300 introduced two years ago, the 350 comes in rack-mountable four-processor modules, each 3.5 inches tall, that can be stacked together to form a single large system. The systems also accommodate special-purpose chassis for extra memory or input-output slots. SGI is aiming the system at broadcast and military customers who need a fair amount of computing power in a small space, such as a mobile broadcast or operations center. For government and defense markets, SGI's Origin 350 systems can be stacked in a single rack along with storage components that collectively can receive, process and archive data. In the late 1990s, SGI attempted to penetrate the general-purpose server market but was rebuffed by bigger players such as IBM, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard and by a tight economy. The company now is focused on its core market, which is high-performance technical computing, particularly projects with intense graphics demands such as visualizing data or creating three-dimensional models of new cars. The new system comes with the faster MIPS R16000 processors, compared to the R14000 processors in the Origin 300, Addison Snell, SGI's product manager for high performance computing, said in an interview. In addition, it can accommodate double the memory--as much as 8GB per four-processor node. A lower-end Origin 350 with four processors and 2GB of memory costs $34,580. With eight processors and a separate expansion cabinet for more input-output slots, the price climbs to about $78,000, Snell said. SGI's Origin 350 systems use the company's own Irix version of the Unix operating system, as well as its MIPS processors running at 600MHz to 700MHz. In January, the company debuted its Altix 3000 system with 64 Intel Itanium 2 processors that runs Linux.
2004-10-26 - SGI to upgrade high-end Linux servers next week    MOFFETT FIELD, Calif.--Silicon Graphics Inc. on Monday plans to announce a new Linux computer, a machine that uses Intel's newest Itanium 2 processor and packs the chips twice as compactly as current machines do. The system is the next generation of the Altix 3000 family that SGI launched in 2003 for high-performance computing tasks. SGI calls the system the BX2 because it has twice the bandwidth to transfer data within the system. The BX2 family also is the newest part of SGI's effort to turn around its flagging financial fortunes. The Altix family lets SGI benefit from advances Intel makes with processors and Linux programmers make with software, rather than having to develop its own ecosystem single-handedly, as it has with its older Origin line. The new systems were on display here at NASA's Ames Laboratory, which unveiled a new supercomputer called Columbia on Tuesday that can perform 42.7 trillion calculations per second, or 42.7 teraflops. Columbia uses a total of 10,240 Itanium 2 processors in a combination of the old and new Altix 3700 systems. "This is one of our earliest installs of that product," said Jeff Greenwald, senior director of project management and marketing. The systems will ship with Intel's newest Itanium 2 processor, a version of the "Madison" generation, and will accommodate the "Montecito" model, due to arrive by the end of 2005, SGI said. The newest Madison model includes 9MB of high-speed cache memory instead of the 6MB of current chips. The BX2 version of the Altix 3700 packs 64 processors into one 80-inch-tall cabinet, twice as many as its predecessor managed, Greenwald said. But that higher density means higher heat. SGI will offer an optional water cooling system that chills exhaust air that flows out of the back of each cabinet, Greenwald said. The Itanium 2 processor, in combination with the Linux operating system, replaces the proprietary MIPS chips and Irix operating system SGI has relied on in the past. And though SGI has suffered financially during Intel's slower-than expected Itanium delivery, the shift to the new chips has been swift for SGI, according to Chief Executive Bob Bishop. In the third quarter of 2004, "80 percent of server revenue was Altix, and 20 percent was traditional MIPS-Irix," he said, and the second quarter marked the first time Altix outsold the earlier Origin line. "We feel pretty good about our Altix business." The company has shipped 800 Altix systems with a total of 30,000 processors, Bishop said. Of the 800 systems, 27 have more than 1 terabyte of main memory, and 58 have more than 500 gigabytes, he added. Still, SGI trails the leaders of the high-performance computing market, No. 1 Hewlett-Packard and No. 2 IBM. But HP and SGI are allies in one way: HP is the co-inventor and an aggressive supporter of the Itanium chips. The BX2 system can accommodate as much as 8 terabytes of data for each 512-processor machine, compared with 6 terabytes for its predecessor, Greenwald said. Huge amounts of memory are a hallmark of SGI's systems. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company uses operating systems adapted with a technology called nonuniform memory access, or NUMA, that lets a single operating system run across hundreds of processors. NUMA lets the software run, even though it can take different amounts of time to read or write data to memory, depending on how far away a memory bank is from the processor that's using it. NASA's Columbia supercomputer uses 20 computers, each with 512 processors. Each computer spans several cabinets connected with fat white "NUMAlink" cables. NASA and SGI also just began testing four of those systems, connected into a 2,048-processor machine. SGI doubled the bandwidth of the cables from 3.2 gigabytes per second in NUMAlink 3 to 6.4 gigabytes per second in the BX2's NUMAlink 4, said Dave Parry, senior vice president of SGI's server and platform group. The change: Data is sent in both directions on each NUMAlink 4 wire instead of the one-way travel used by NUMAlink 3. Sending data both ways on a single line is tricky, Parry said. To accomplish the task, a processing system must subtract the signal of the data being transmitted, leaving only the signal of the data being received. The top-end Altix 3700 isn't the only system being upgraded with Intel's new processors. The other half of SGI's product line, the Prism family for data visualization tasks, will be upgraded "almost concurrently" with the 3700, said Paul McNamara, senior vice president of SGI's visual computing group. The Prism line is based on SGI's midrange Altix 350 products.
2002-11-11 - SGI to unveil new supercomputer    A new supercomputer from SGI packs far more computing power per square inch than do competing machines, a breakthrough the company hopes will help it flourish in what it sees as a renaissance in supercomputing. The Origin 3900, which SGI will unveil Monday and also show off at the Supercomputing 2002 trade show beginning Nov. 18 in Baltimore, can hold up to 128 processors and fit into a single rack, said Addison Snell, product marketing manager for high performance computing at SGI. Current Origin computers can hold only 32 processors in a rack. "The Origin 3900 effectively quadruples the maximum compute density," he said. "It has the density of a blade (server) but the architecture of a supercomputer." Floor space in computing rooms is valuable, so reducing the size of computers saves money and expands the places where these systems can be installed. Versions of the Origin 3900, for example, could be fit onto an oil exploration ship or a plane. The density of the Origin 3900 is largely accomplished through the low-energy characteristics of the company's MIPS processor, which consumes about 17 watts, about the same as a notebook chip. Additionally, density increases performance by reducing the distance that signals have to travel between the processors, memory and other subsystems. The subsets of most large supercomputers are linked through cables. Because signals can't be accelerated, the best improvement lies in pushing the machines closer together. SGI, a much beleaguered company, is hoping that these architectural changes will help it latch onto the recent increase in activity in scientific computing. The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and other events have breathed new life into the market, prompting companies such as IBM and SGI to enhance their products and service offerings. "Clearly there are some areas of the scientific and technical computing market that are picking up," said Jean Bozman, a research vice president at market research firm IDC. One of the more active areas is that of the life sciences. Despite the economic downturn, biotech companies are continuing to invest in computing capabilities, according to executives, because of the nature of their businesses and because of promising opportunities. Also, said one server executive, "They have money." In September, for instance, IBM formed an alliance with life sciences giant Applera to design systems and services for pharmaceutical research companies. Military and defense contracting have also increased since September 2001, Snell said. The bulk of the budget increases, which are classified, comes from the effort to create a Department of Homeland Security. Concern about U.S. national defense is also a contributing factor. The computing power of NEC's Earth Simulator sent shock waves through the U.S. government because it marked the first time that Japan had a substantial lead over the United States. "To the U.S. government, this was a Sputnik-class event," Snell said. Large companies are also examining larger systems for testing and simulation. Procter & Gamble, for example, uses an SGI system to study the aerodynamics of Pringle's potato chips, Snell said. The chips move along a conveyor belt so fast that they actually take flight. Through aerodynamic modeling, the company can change the shape of the chips and speed up manufacturing. P&G also uses the system to study fluid dynamics in disposable diapers. In the next few months, SGI will come out with its first Itanium 2 computers. These systems will hold 32 processors per rack and will run the Linux operating system. The base configuration of the Origin 3900 includes four processors and 512MB of memory. A beefed-up system with 128 processors and 64GB of memory sells for $2.9 million.
2005-11-12 - SGI to show next-generation Linux machines Silicon Graphics will start showing off the Altix 4000 Monday, the second generation of the company's technical computing machines based on the Linux operating system and Itanium processors. The high-performance systems will accommodate as many as 512 processors, as does the current Altix 3000, said Jill Matzke, SGI's head of Altix product marketing. But a new design lets it accommodate as much as 128 terabytes of memory, larger than the 24 terabyte limit of the Altix 3000 and about 250,000 times as much memory as is found in a mainstream PC. SGI plans to show the systems at the SC2005 supercomputing show in Seattle this week. Previous Altix designs used "bricks," or block-shaped servers, each with up to eight processors and associated memory. The new design replaces these with blade servers, which are slimmer. But it keeps the modular system, Matzke said. One new feature of the design: Customers can purchase blades that have nothing but memory, letting gargantuan amounts of data be kept readily on hand. The new Altix line should go on sale in late February or early March, Matzke said. The machines will accommodate the current "Madison 9M" version of the Intel's Itanium processor as well as the chipmaker's delayed dual-core Montecito, due to arrive in mid-2006. SGI had planned to release the new Altix in 2005. SGI once was a Silicon Valley computing power, but the company has struggled to reverse a years-long revenue slide. Because of stock price declines, the New York Stock Exchange delisted SGI's shares this month. It's a specialist in high-performance technical computing, but has come under competitive pressure from companies such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and even Dell that sell machines that also can be sold to the much larger business market. SGI, based in Mountain View, Calif., has made it most of the way through a transition from its own MIPS processors and the Irix operating system to Intel's Itanium and Linux. Previously, its machines required a separate SGI-enhanced version of Linux, but that version is being phased out now that Novell's Suse Linux includes support for SGI's high-end features, Matzke said.
2005-04-26 - SGI to release Itanium workstation Shortly after rival Hewlett-Packard withdrew from the market, Silicon Graphics has begun selling a new workstation with Intel's Itanium processor. SGI's new system, which costs between $8,500 and $39,000, accommodates one or two Itanium 2 processors and as much as 24GB of memory, the company is expected to announce Tuesday. It's based on the same technology, including the Linux operating system and ATI graphics hardware, as the company's higher-end Prism products introduced last October. SGI has embraced Itanium and Linux as an alternative to its earlier models with its own MIPS processors and Irix operating system. Though the new products have taken off rapidly for the company, it continues to struggle financially. In the quarter ended March 25, the company had a net loss of $45 million, results that were "far short of our initial expectations," said Chief Executive Bob Bishop, citing competitive pressure and a failure to close several deals. HP co-developed Itanium and remains its chief advocate among computer makers, but facing weak demand, it discontinued Itanium workstations last year. Instead, it chose to focus on machines using Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron and Intel's Xeon--models that remain compatible with x86 chips such as Pentium but that add 64-bit support useful for jobs that need large quantities of memory. But Simon Hayhurst, manager of SGI's visuals system line, said SGI's machines are geared for different tasks from both Opteron workstations. Specifically, it can transfer data to and from memory faster and can accommodate more memory. Though some dual-processor Opteron systems will accommodate 32GB of memory eventually, doing so will require higher-capacity memory chips, which will mean the SGI system can reach as high as 48GB, Hayhurst said.
2003-05-22 - SGI to lay off 10 percent of staff High-end computer maker Silicon Graphics Inc. said Thursday that it plans to cut 400 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, in an effort to return to profitability. Mountain View, Calif.-based SGI said the move was part of a restructuring effort that would save the company about $10 million per quarter, starting with the quarter ending Sept. 26. The company said it plans to take a restructuring-related charge of between $15 million and $20 million in the quarter ending June 27, mainly due to severance packages. An SGI representative said employees were being notified about the cuts on Thursday. She said layoffs would take place companywide and that marketing and administrative positions would be hardest hit, while sales and engineering departments would be least affected. SGI CEO Bob Bishop said the company decided to restructure because revenue has been disappointing, despite SGI's expanded defense contracts and the growing demand for its Altix line of superclusters and servers, which use Intel's Itanium processors and run the Linux operating system. "Today's announcement reflects our determination to take the steps required to improve the company's financial position and reduce its breakeven point," Bishop said in a statement. Over the past two years, SGI has abandoned its ill-fated plans to expand into the general-purpose server market amid disappointing revenue and challenges from entrenched competitors, including IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and Dell Computer. Instead, SGI has worked toward returning to its roots, selling high-end servers and workstations for visually intensive tasks such as designing cars and creating digital imagery for movies, including the "Lord of the Rings" series. In January, it landed a multimillion-dollar deal with Lockheed Martin, which bought new SGI high-end servers to train Air Force F-16 fighter jet pilots. The following month, it won a $26 million contract with the Department of Defense. The restructuring plan comes a month after the company announced disappointing results for its fiscal third quarter, which Bishop called "a tough quarter." For that period, the company posted a loss of $35 million, down from a net gain of $10 million in last year's third quarter.
2003-04-22 - SGI stock falls after hard quarter SGI stock dropped 32 cents, or nearly 22 percent, to $1.16 in trading Tuesday after the high-performance computer specialist reported declines in revenue and a net loss of $35 million. SGI's revenue dropped 17 percent from $263 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2002 to $217 million for the same quarter this year, which ended March 28. In the year-ago quarter, SGI had a net income of $10 million. "Our first quarter was a tough quarter, with significant uncertainty, delays and deferrals that came about as war with Iraq approached, especially for large-scale projects that were near their close," although several delayed deals did close after the end of the quarter, Chief Executive Bob Bishop said in a conference call Monday. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company has been struggling to recover from an unsuccessful expansion in the late 1990s. It's been seeking for about two years to return to its core customers that buy high-end systems for tasks such as visualizing car interior designs or simulating aerial combat. At the same time, competitors IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and Dell Computer are grappling with declines in server spending and aren't pulling any punches. SGI had a "sharp decline" in its Japanese business in the quarter, the company said. Visualization products also suffered. In the current quarter, though, the company will begin selling the Onyx 350, a graphics-oriented version of the Origin 350 announced a week ago. "A lower-priced Onyx is the No. 1 request we get from our customers," said Chief Operating Officer Warren Pratt, and the new Origin 350 meets that demand with a starting price below $35,000 but a design that can expand to vastly larger configurations. SGI's Altix line, which uses Intel's Itanium processors and runs the Linux operating system, is beginning to catch on, the company said, though revenue isn't yet significant. The University of Manchester purchased a 256-processor system, Pratt said, while 128-processor machines were bought by famed astrophysicist Steven Hawking at Cambridge University, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the University of Leeds, Washington University and the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis in Denmark. SGI has been working to ensure software partners support the Altix machine and is collaborating with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to improve Linux for the systems. The company will launch a new advertising campaign to raise the profile of the new computers, Pratt added.
2006-09-19 - SGI set to exit bankruptcy protection  A judge accepted computer maker Silicon Graphics Inc.'s reorganization plan Tuesday, setting the stage for the company to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October, the company said. Under the plan, SGI has new top management and will get an entirely new board of directors, said Dennis McKenna, who took over as chief executive in January. The company's goal is to return to profitability in fiscal 2007, which ends June 30, he said. The Silicon Valley icon, which rose to prominence with computer graphics systems for movies such as "Jurassic Park," has struggled for years as mainstream computers from companies such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and Dell have grown more powerful. But the company has taken several steps toward recovery, appointing McKenna, laying off 12 percent of employees in March, filing for bankruptcy protection in May, and dropping its older computers based on its own MIPS processors and Irix version of the Unix operating system. "For us it feels like a new SGI. It's a relaunch of the company," McKenna said. McKenna said the company will be smaller, too. Before the restructuring, it employed 2,200, but only 1,600 remain. The reduced payroll costs contribute to a cut of $150 million in annual expenses, McKenna said. In addition, three-quarters of SGI's products now on the market were introduced in the last nine months, and the company is trying to tackle a larger market by expanding from high-end systems with Intel Itanium processors to lower-end models using Intel's Xeon. The latter approach links numerous systems together in a cluster. SGI will continue selling products for engineering, scientific and research tasks. The company also is gunning for a larger market in managing corporate data, for example mining it for useful trends or selling servers with very large memory capacity. Judge Burton Lifland in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the southern district of New York ruled Tuesday that SGI has met all the necessary requirements to implement its reorganization plan, SGI said. "Every voting class of creditors voted overwhelmingly in favor of the plan," the company said in a statement. As part of the plan, SGI said it has obtained financing to exit bankruptcy, McKenna said. Specifically, Morgan Stanley provided an $85 million loan and General Electric Capital provided a $30 million line of credit. The funds will be used to pay off Chapter 11 bridge financing and for ordinary business operations, McKenna said. The company once had a strong business selling high-powered graphics systems for tasks such as visualizing 3D automobile models or underground oil reserves. Those days are gone. "Visualization...is an insignificant portion of our business today," McKenna said. Accordingly, the company will refer to itself only by its initials. "Our legal name is Silicon Graphics. But our branding and messaging will all be around 'SGI,'" McKenna said. Intel delayed its new "Montecito" Itanium processor that had been scheduled to ship in 2005 but that only now is arriving in servers. That delay hurt SGI, McKenna said. "As a result of those delays, there were delays in the procurement process at our customers. Clearly it was an opportunity for the competition," McKenna said. Customers were concerned about the longer-term commitment of Intel to the Itanium product line. I think that's been confirmed over and over that they remain committed to that." When it comes to x86 chips, Advanced Micro Devices has provided new competition to Intel. But McKenna said Intel has the winning processor in that market today with its new "Woodcrest" Xeon chips. "We looked at that very strongly in making our decision on our Xeon 'Woodcrest' cluster solution. Clearly AMD has done an excellent job with the Opteron, but that's looking in the rearview mirror," McKenna said. "Intel's solution going forward was compelling and provided better price performance, thermal performance, and die size versus Opteron," and now speed tests put Xeon in the lead as well, he said.
2004-01-12 - SGI releases midrange Linux server Silicon Graphics Inc. expanded its Linux computer line into the midrange area on Monday, unveiling an Altix model with as many as 16 Itanium 2 processors. The maker of high-end computers and storage systems introduced its Linux server line a year ago with the release of the 64-processor Altix 3000. The new 16-processor Altix 350, which can be assembled from four-processor modules, could appeal to customers with more modest demands and budgets. A four-processor Altix 350 costs $21,599 and supports as much as 192GB of memory, according to Mountain View, Calif.-based SGI. The Altix line is strategically important for SGI, a technical computing specialist that has been struggling to recover for years from a failed bid to expand into the mainstream server market. Its core customer base typically uses computers with SGI's own MIPS processors and the Irix version of the Unix operating system. Moving to Intel's Itanium chips and to Linux offers the company a chance to reduce its research and development expenses. Among the Altix 350's competitors are IBM's p650, an eight-processor system with a starting price of about $27,000 for a dual-processor configuration; Hewlett-Packard's four-processor rx5670, with a starting price of about $22,000; and Sun Microsystems' V880z, an eight-processor machine with a starting price of about $60,000. The higher-end Altix 3000 comes in 64-processor configurations today, with a 128-processor model expected in the spring of 2004. Customers can special order Altix 3000 systems with as many as 512 Itanium 2 processors. SGI has been under a financial cloud, but its stock rose recently after it restructured its debt and reported financial results that have shown it nearer to profitability.
2001-05-01 - SGI promotes CFO boosts Linux effort   SGI, struggling to regain its share of the graphics workstation business, has promoted Chief Financial Officer Hal Covert to president, freeing Chief Executive Bob Bishop to spend more time with customers. In addition, the Mountain View, Calif., company released version 1.0 of a high-end file system for Linux, the clone of Unix that SGI has banked on heavily for its future workstation and server products. SGI promised that the software would be released for Linux nearly two years ago. "I can focus on the internal operations," concentrating on making the company more efficient and profitable, Covert said in an interview Tuesday. That means Bishop "will be able to focus full-time attention on customers and the overall strategic direction of the company." Covert will retain his CFO title but shift some of his duties to others. Years ago, SGI hoped to use Intel servers with the Windows operating system to help the company become as powerful as Sun Microsystems, but the plan proved overambitious, and SGI reverted to its older plan of selling high-end Unix supercomputers and systems for tasks such as scrutinizing automobile designs. The worsening economic climate has made the transition harder, and SGI announced in April it would lay off 1,000 employees to adjust for lower revenue. The company hopes to achieve profitability in the quarter beginning in July. "We're a little behind where we want to be," Covert said. Others were more skeptical. "We believe SGI is three to four quarters away from operating profitability," Salomon Smith Barney analyst John Jones wrote in a recent research note. "SGI's announced 1,000-employee staff reduction is a good start, although this special charge will likely cost" $65 million to $75 million in cash in the third and fourth quarters of calendar 2001. The current economic climate has been hammering SGI as well as competitors such as Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard and Sun, but Covert said the company expects the situation to improve in the second half of 2001. Covert joined SGI after leaving Linux software company Red Hat in July 2000. SGI is banking on Linux for computers using Intel's upcoming Itanium chip, expected to be announced late this May, according to a source familiar with the plan. Part of the company's longer-term effort to accommodate the chip consequently relies on improving Linux in directions where SGI thinks it can do better than the competition. To that end, SGI released version 1.0 of XFS, file system software that governs how a computer reads and writes information on hard disks. XFS is a "journaling" file system, which keeps track of changes to files so that it's easier and faster to recover from computer crashes. Most high-end operating systems, such as Windows 2000 and various versions of Unix, have journaling file systems. With the release of XFS, Linux now has four, along with JFS from IBM, ReiserFS and ext3. Because Linux computers can use numerous file systems simultaneously and the various journaling file systems each have their advantages, top Linux programmers intend to let all the file systems compete side by side.
2007-01-11 - SGI plugs in Windows for compute clusters  Supercomputing specialist SGI has become Microsoft's latest partner, signing up to support a version of Windows that can farm out computing jobs to a cluster of lower-end servers. SGI previously had focused chiefly on the open-source Linux operating system, which dominates the market for computing clusters. But now the company will sell Microsoft's Compute Cluster Server version of Windows as well, the partners plan to announce Thursday. The move is part of SGI's attempt to attract smaller businesses as customers, part of an expansion plan announced in the company's 2005 effort to recover from bankruptcy protection. Like rivals IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Sun Microsystems, it believes high-performance computing is suited not just to large research establishments but also to smaller entities. These include small companies that need to find useful information in business records, or the departments of larger enterprises. "Last spring, we started down the path of seeking to make high-performance computing more broadly applicable," said Dave Parry, SGI's senior vice president and product general manager. Running computing clusters is complicated, but Microsoft wants to bring it within range of mere mortals--or at least to make it "easy to deploy by a large number of Windows IT administrators," said Kyril Faenov, general manager of high-performance computing at the Redmond, Wash., company. It hopes that doing so will mean smaller departments will be able to use the technology. The terms of the deal weren't announced. Microsoft already has compute cluster deals with HP, IBM, Dell and a number of smaller companies, Faenov said. SGI, after scrapping its MIPS processor family and Irix operating system, has largely moved its product line to Intel's Itanium processor and Linux. But last year, it announced plans for Intel Xeon-based clusters as well. The compute cluster version of Windows runs only on x86 systems such as Xeon-based machines, and on Monday, SGI introduced a new model in that line, the XE310 server. It uses Supermicro's small motherboard, which lets two dual-processor machines fit into a 1.75-inch-thick chassis. The XE310 also accommodates Intel's quad-core Xeon 5300 "Clovertown" processor. The XE310 systems can be purchased individually for a starting price of $3,100, or in a preconfigured cluster called the XE1300. The new products are due to ship in March, SGI said.
2000-07-26 - SGI pins recovery hopes on new server  Beleaguered computer hardware maker SGI has introduced a bold new Unix server design, a product that carries the company's best hopes yet for financial recovery. The new Origin 3000 server series is the rallying cry for SGI's return to its roots: slick, high-powered computers that wow technical computing users. It took several years for the company to shed its grander ambitions, but analysts believe SGI will be more successful in this niche market than in trying to take on giants such as Sun Microsystems, IBM and Hewlett-Packard. "The just-announced NUMAflex modular computing is poised to bring SGI back to profitability," Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Milunovich said in a report yesterday. "Our belief is that the new products will sell well," he said, predicting that $620 million in revenue for the last three months of the year will carry SGI to a net income of 2 cents per share. The new server is the central component of SGI's turnaround strategy. A second is the hiring this week of Hal Covert, formerly of Red Hat and Adobe and now SGI's chief financial officer. A third is the acquisition of Intel workstation designs from former competitor Intergraph. SGI, which analysts said has languished while awaiting the Origin 3000, is banking on the new design. "It feels like a start-up around here," said Jan Silverman, vice president of advanced systems marketing at SGI. "We're drastically undervalued in the market." The new machine, code-named SN-1, has a framework that can be configured by plugging in a wide variety of modules. These "bricks" include CPUs, communications slots, graphics accelerators, hard disks and other components. And using a technology called NUMA (nonuniform memory architecture), which distributes memory into numerous small islands instead of one large block, the server can accommodate as many as 512 CPUs. The company has a backlog of more than $100 million in orders for the new machine, SGI said Monday. The first model, using hundreds of processors, was purchased by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Silverman said. "They really needed to do this," said International Data Corp. (IDC) analyst Jean Bozman. "This is an important machine for them." Bozman expects the new Origin 3000 will appeal chiefly to existing SGI customers. Getting here hasn't been easy, though. The frequent course changes at SGI have resulted in financial difficulties, layoffs and the flight of several executives. SGI this week reported a quarterly loss that was 4 cents per share deeper than analysts expected, even after adjusting for a warning July 11, and part of the trouble stemmed from delays to the new system, the company said. SGI has to deal with the aggressive expansion of much larger Sun Microsystems, which is funding a push into SGI's market of high-performance technical and graphics computing. IBM and Hewlett-Packard, the other major Unix server companies, also smell blood. Like Sun, they have major new top-end servers due in coming months. HP this week announced a new line of inexpensive Unix workstations that come with new fx5 and fx10 graphics accelerators. The Origin 3000 is the first SGI machine that will accommodate Intel's new Itanium chip, the first of a family of 64-bit CPUs called IA-64. And though IA-64 has been delayed again, SGI isn't complaining. Silverman said the delay will allow SGI to release its Itanium version of the Origin 3000 at the same time as other manufacturers release their Itanium servers. And while SGI's machine with four Itanium chips will cost the same as other companies' four-ways, SGI's will be expandable to 16 processors, Silverman said. However, there are some limits to the SGI Itanium machine. For one thing, it will run Linux, and Linux won't work well beyond a 16-processor configuration, Silverman said. However, he added, more processors can be used as long as they run a separate instance of the operating system. By contrast, SGI's version of Unix, called Irix, runs on as many as 512 of SGI's R12000 CPUs. NASA has an Origin 3000 using 1,024, Silverman said. SGI has been working to bring this capability to Linux, a comparatively young operating system embraced by most computing companies and on which SGI has staked its future. SGI touts the flexibility of its Origin 3000. For jobs requiring lots of data input and output, the machine can be populated with "P bricks," each with 12 PCI slots. An X brick delivers high-speed networking. D bricks add storage. CPU bricks boost computing horsepower. With the use of a graphics brick, the Origin 3000 becomes the high-end Onyx 3000 graphics workstation, Silverman said. High-powered graphics machines are a hallmark of SGI, whose hardware was used to produce "Jurassic Park" and parts of "Toy Story 2." The system will be able to accommodate both the existing R12000 chips, Itanium chips and Itanium's successor, code-named McKinley, though the different chip modules will have to run separate operating systems and won't be able to share memory, Silverman said. This isn't the first time SGI has pinned its hopes on a new computer product. Under the leadership of former chief executive Rick Belluzzo, the company embarked on a strategy to bring its engineering expertise to Windows workstations. But the products, much delayed, were a flop, and last year, the company wrote off its unique designs. But maybe things will be different with the 3000 series. "Given that Mr. Bishop can attract top talent like this, there must be something there to build on," Milunovich wrote. "Now the task will be to get the sales force motivated." The Origin 3000 series comes in three models. The 3200 has two to eight processors, the 3400 has four to 32, and the 3800 has 16 to 512. Prices are expected to start around $50,000 for a two-processor model, though entry-level systems are more likely to cost about $100,000. For computational tasks such as gene sequencing, systems will cost $500,000 to $600,000, Silverman said. Design systems purchased by customers such as automotive companies will cost in the neighborhood of $2 million, and high-end systems for universities probably will cost $5 million to $10 million, he said.
2002-10-03 - SGI funds Linux advocate   One of the industry's oldest advocates of the Linux operating system has taken a position with high-end computer maker SGI. At SGI, Jon "maddog" Hall will continue his company-neutral role as executive director of Linux International, said Paul McNamara, SGI vice president of products and platforms. SGI is sponsoring Hall the way VA Linux Systems and Compaq Computer have done in the past, McNamara said. "We want to get more active in sponsoring things going on in the community," such as the pool of open-source programmers who collectively create Linux, often as volunteers, McNamara said. "We thought this was a good way to demonstrate our commitment to the community." SGI makes high-end computers with a particular specialty in visually challenging problems such as portraying complex 3D car models. SGI aggressively embraced Windows in the mid-1990s and Linux in the late 1990s, but the still unprofitable company failed to keep up with bigger competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems. SGI is working on a new Linux computer that uses Intel's high-end Itanium processor. SGI's first Itanium-based computers are due in January 2003, spokeswoman Ginny Babbitt said.
2004-10-26 - SGI claims lead in supercomputer race  MOFFETT FIELD, Calif.--Although a victor won't be declared for two weeks yet, Silicon Graphics has become the second computer maker to boast that its machinery is leading a competition for world's fastest supercomputer. The system, a $50 million Linux-based NASA machine called Columbia, which SGI sold in July, can perform 42.7 trillion calculations per second, or 42.7 teraflops, SGI announced Tuesday. However, that speed isn't the final word: The system used only four-fifths of the 10,240 Intel Itanium 2 processors in the full machine being uncloaked at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. The speed is a notch faster than the 36.01 teraflops IBM reported for its Blue Gene/L system in September. That performance was enough to edge Big Blue ahead of NEC's Earth Simulator, which since 2002 has led a list of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers. IBM's test, performed Sept. 16, also is likely to be outdone by a later score. The Top500 rankings are updated twice yearly, and new results will be published at the SC2004 supercomputing show in Pittsburgh beginning Nov. 6. SGI isn't promising it will remain the speed king. "It's clear there are a few horses all making a dash for the finish line," said Dave Parry, senior vice president of SGI's server and platform group. "IBM may scrape up a few more cabinets and do a little more." Virginia Tech is another organization looking for a little supercomputer glory before the new list is published. The school announced Tuesday that it clocked its upgraded System X machine at 12.25 teraflops. Columbia uses Itanium 2 processors--a combination of current models that come with 6MB of high-speed cache memory and as-yet-unannounced models with 9MB of cache. SGI has been struggling to reclaim the prowess and prestige it had in 1990s, when its high-end computers stood out for demanding graphics challenges such as digital animation in the movie "Jurassic Park." But using Intel processors has given the company's equipment a boost, said Walt Brooks, division chief of NASA's Advanced Supercomputing Center--the Itanium machines are six times faster than the SGI models they replace. SGI's system is different from many clusters of low-end machines that make up most supercomputers today. Columbia is made of twenty 512-processor machines connected with the high-speed InfiniBand networking technology, and each machine runs a single operating system. That "single-system image" approach is good for tasks such as simulations of the space shuttle's aerodynamics, Brooks said. Clusters can be used for fluid dynamics, "but it's extremely inefficient with those systems and the programming is very difficult," he said. Another task the systems are being used for is hurricane forecasting. Software under development now shows promise at being able to forecast a hurricane's path five days into the future with the accuracy of current two-day forecasts, Brooks said. The system is much more complicated as well as more complicated than a conventional server. After a surprise power outage hit the machine early Tuesday, engineers were called in early to oversee the two-hour reboot of the complete machine, Brooks said. The system was assembled with extraordinary rapidity--120 days from the close of the deal to design, assemble and test the system, executives and NASA officials said at an unveiling Tuesday. NASA had to secure approval from the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Republican and Democratic appropriations committee staffs for the House and Senate, and six NASA divisions. "That all happened in a month. Can you imagine moving the entire government in 30 days?" asked G. Scott Hubbard, director of NASA Ames. And the system has been used as sections were brought online. "This is like making up the bed with the patient in it," Hubbard said. SGI has just completed work connecting four of the 512-processor machines into a single system with 2,048 processors running a single instance of Linux. Future upgrade possibilities include joining another four in a similar way, along with boosts with newer Intel processors, Brooks said. Initial Columbia components were SGI's conventional Altix 3700 machines, but the newer parts are a replacement model that's got twice the processor density, Parry said. NASA has been a longtime customer of SGI's top-end systems. The new 512-processor machines can perform at about three teraflops each--six times the performance of the earlier systems using SGI's MIPS chips and Irix operating system, Brooks said. However, that performance comes at a cost: heat. The cabinets of the SGI systems in Columbia have been specially modified with water-cooled radiator systems that chill the hot exhaust air that rises off the chips. Columbia takes up the area of about three basketball courts, Brooks said. It currently consumes about 2 megawatts of the facility's 8-megawatt capacity. The largest MIPS-Irix system SGI ever built had 1,024 processors--another NASA Ames machine, Chief Executive Bob Bishop said. Intel Chief Operating Officer Paul Otellini said in September that the system would have a performance of 60 teraflops, but that was an estimate of the machine's peak speed. The Top500 list ranks computers according to a number that's typically lower, the sustained performance. The ratio of sustained performance to peak performance is called efficiency. The 16-system speed test had an efficiency of 88 percent.
2004-10-11 - SGI brings visualization to Linux line Silicon Graphics has brought high-end graphics abilities to its Linux- and Itanium-based computers, an important step in the company's expansion from its more proprietary equipment. The Mountain View, Calif., company sells two classes of computers--some models for general high-performance computing and offshoots with advanced graphics abilities. Until now, the graphics abilities were only available on the company's older line using its own MIPS processors and Irix operating system. The Silicon Graphics Prism is anItanium-based visualization system. The older products still has some advantages--the chips run cooler and Irix has features Linux still lacks--but the Itanium line is less expensive, said spokeswoman Ginny Babbitt. Prices for the new Itanium-based Prism line start at $30,000, compared to $45,000 for the MIPS-based Onyx system, and the Itanium machines are faster. The systems are important to financially struggling SGI: The Itanium-based products have attracted new customers and shown increasing revenue. Lower-end Prism systems cost $30,000 to $150,000 with two to eight processors; midrange models range from $75,000 to $150,000 with eight to 16 processors; and high-end models begin at $200,000 for 16 to 512 processors. Like the MIPS-based Onyx line, the Prism systems use mainstream ATI FireGL graphics chips. Software is a sticking point for SGI because there's little available for high-end graphics systems running Linux, Babbitt said. However, a new partnership could help out: Software from a company called Transitive lets programs for MIPS-Irix run unmodified on Itanium-Linux systems, she said.
2003-01-07 - SGI begins high-end Linux push SGI, a maker of high-end computers for technical tasks, has begun selling a new server running Linux on as many as 64 Itanium 2 processors, the company plans to announce Tuesday. The system--which had been code-named SN2 and now is called the Altix 3000 series--is geared for customers who need to make heavy-duty numerical calculations such as car-crash analysis or aircraft aerodynamics. It also comes with a price tag that can reach above $1 million for high-end configurations of the refrigerator-size machine. The Altix 3000 systems are essentially an adaptation of SGI's existing Origin 3000 systems, which use SGI-designed MIPS processors and Irix, its version of Unix. The Altix 3000 systems, though, use Itanium processors and Linux, a move that lets SGI benefit from others' research and development budgets and that weans SGI off its reliance on its in-house technology. "They've gotten themselves over to a processor with pretty good performance prospects," said Gordon Haff, an Illuminata analyst. "If you're in the high-performance computing game, you'd better be able to deliver high performance. This would have become more and more of an issue with MIPS, (and Linux right now is) clearly the current darling of the high-performance computing crowd." It wasn't easy getting to this point, though. The Altix line is SGI's second crack at Linux systems--the first being with lower-end general-purpose servers that faced tough competition from much larger companies such as Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard. SGI has also had a tough time with Windows workstations, an experience that led the company to retrench and focus on its high-end technical customers rather than the general business market. The Altix, though, is geared for its more specialized customers. "This is very technologically impressive. It's not a general-purpose box, but it's technologically impressive for the types of problems it's tackling," Haff said. SGI is positioning the new system as a competitor to cluster supercomputers, which combine groups of lower-end servers with a high-speed interconnect. Such systems tend to be good for tasks that can be broken up into independent jobs. SGI also offers the capability to link several Altix 3000 systems into a cluster of high-end servers, with plans ultimately to support eight nodes--512 processors in total--by the end of the first year of shipment, according to Jan Silverman, senior vice president of marketing at SGI. The architecture supports as many as 2,048 processors in total, the company said. SGI had been touting a predecessor for the Altix, the SN1, but that machine never saw the light of day. Based on the first Itanium processor--Intel's ill-fated Merced chip--the SN1 was used only for software development purposes. The new SGI system can use a stock version of Linux from Red Hat, said Greg Estes, the company's vice president of corporate marketing. But SGI recommends using a modified version that includes improvements such as SGI's XFS file system and software that takes advantage of specific features in the SGI systems. SGI also has contributed to work such as the Linux Scalability Effort to improve the operating system on high-end machines. There are two configurations of the Altix system: the 3300, with as many as 12 processors, and the 3700, with as many as 64. Each system will accept sequels to the current Itanium 2 product, including models code-named Madison and Montecito, due for release this year and next. A 16-processor 3700 with 16GB of memory costs $305,000, and a 64-processor system with 64GB of memory costs $1 million, according to SGI. Representatives for SGI said the University of Tokyo has purchased a 64-processor 3700, a 32-processor 3700 and a 12-processor 3300, and the University of Queensland in Australia has purchased a 64-processor 3700 and an eight-processor 3700.
1999-11-16 - SGI banks on Linux Intel chips LAS VEGAS--SGI will demonstrate a cluster of Linux computers running Intel's new Itanium processors, the company said today. The company will demonstrate the machine at Supercomputing 99, a computer show in Portland, Oregon, the company said at Comdex here today. Mountain View, California-based SGI, which sells servers and workstations, is in the midst of a years-long transition to the Itanium chips, formerly code-named Merced. Intel has built prototypes, but Itanium computer systems aren't expected until the second half of 2000. Delays to the chip, however, forced SGI to extend its Mips chip family, former SGI chief executive Rick Belluzzo said in an earlier interview. In addition to moving from Mips chips to Intel chips, SGI is moving from the Irix operating system to Linux. The company wants Linux to run on systems with hundreds of processors, and SGI is contributing effort to the multicompany Trillian project to achieve that goal. The technology transitions at SGI raise the possibility that a government-funded supercomputer could run the Linux operating system. SGI is moving to Intel chips so it can take advantage of the lower prices for chips made in larger quantities. Hewlett-Packard, which invented the architecture for the Itanium chip, is embarking on a similar plan and joined Intel to make those high-volume sales possible. While SGI is moving ahead with Itanium-based systems, it's also spinning off its Cray Research supercomputer division. However, the prospects for Cray are in question. VA Linux Systems also is working on connecting lots of Linux computers. The company, which has filed to go public in coming weeks, announced a machine at Argonne National Laboratory with 256 two-processor machines. The machine, called "Chiba City," will be available to many researchers testing open-source software such as managing clusters of computers, visualizing scientific information and distributing computing jobs over many machines. The computers are tied together with the "Beowulf" method. Chiba City is a futuristic city in William Gibson's science fiction novel "Neuromancer," the book in which Gibson coined the term "cyberspace." Fifty Argonne researchers built the machine in two days at a "barn-raising," complete with a banjo, VA said in a statement. Chiba City also uses IBM servers to manage the system
2003-10-21 - SGI aims high with Altix machine   NASA is using a Linux machine from Silicon Graphics with 256 Itanium 2 processors and plans to double that soon, the company said Monday after posting financial results that moved it closer toward profitability. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has long been a customer of SGI's high-end computers using its Irix operating system and MIPS processors. Now it's following suit with the company's Linux-Itanium line, called Altix. The new product line is a key part of the company's attempt to try to reverse a years-long revenue decline by tapping into growing markets. "NASA Ames (Research Center) has stepped up to the plate by installing a 256-processor single-system image Altix machine," SGI Chief Executive Bob Bishop said Monday in a conference call with financial analysts. "They are in fact intending to scale this machine to a 512-processor single-system image in the very near future." Get Up to Speed on... Open source Get the latest headlines andcompany-specific news in ourexpanded GUTS section. Running a single-system image means that a single instance of the operating system spans the entire machine. In contrast, much recent work using Linux in technical computing markets has involved numerous independent but interconnected servers. The SGI and NASA work is a significant expansion of the use of Linux, which historically has run only on lower-end servers with a handful of processors. However, the SGI machines are geared for technical computing tasks, not the mainstream commercial workloads such as housing corporate databases for which IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems design their high-end servers. SGI's future depends on Altix, said Charles Wolf and Justin Udelhofen, analysts for Needham and Co., in an October report. "The company's only hope for revenue expansion--aside from a modest upgrade cycle to its current installed base--is its Altix line of Linux supercomputers. Accelerated uptake in this new hybrid platform would enable SGI to wean itself from its significant investments in proprietary operating system and processor technologies," the analysts wrote. Bishop indicated some progress on Monday in making the Altix mainstream. It now is certified to run some engineering software, which led to sales of the machine to Boeing, Honda, Motorola, Honeywell, 3M, DaimlerChrysler, Mazda and Tata Motors. SGI also sold Altix systems with at least 128 processors to the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Bishop said. SGI said in August it plans to make the 128-processor Altix models a standard configuration in the spring of 2004. Linux is growing in popularity but has been caught up in legal action by SCO Group, which asserts that Linux infringes on its own Unix intellectual property. Though SCO last week said it is satisfied with current discussions with SGI, the two companies have tussled over SGI's right to use Irix, a version of Unix. SGI Chief Operating Officer Warren Pratt said Monday on the conference call that the company is confident Linux is safe. After reviewing the software involved, "We believe that SCO's allegation have no merit. We don't believe SCO has any basis for terminating our fully paid Unix license," Pratt said. "We do not think the current controversy will stand in the way of the long-term trends affecting the adoption of Linux," he added. "It's full speed ahead with our Linux and Irix products." The company's Irix-based line, called Origin, remains more advanced than the Altix products for now. In the most recent quarter, SGI installed a 2,048 single-system image machine at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, Bishop said. But times have been tough for Mountain View, Calif.-based SGI. After a failed attempt to become a mainstream server seller, the company has been working in recent years to return to high-end technical computing and visualization systems despite the increasing competition from larger companies. SGI cut 600 employees in August and 400 in May. The company's employment will drop to about 3,100 in December, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Zellmer said Monday. In the most recent quarter, SGI had a net loss of $43.6 million compared with $34.5 million a year ago. However, the recent quarter's loss included non-recurring costs, including $15 million in severance charges and $9 million to move corporate headquarters to a less expensive location. Some bright news came earlier in October, when SGI announced higher revenue than previously forecast for its first fiscal quarter of 2004, which ended Sept. 26. The company reported $218 million in revenue, less than the $240 million for the same period a year ago, but more than the $200 million to $210 million it earlier had forecast. The Needham analysts overall were unfazed by the SGI revenue increase. "Its outlook remains largely unchanged. Namely, the continual erosion of its Origin sales and installed base has yet to subside. And competitors continue to swarm at the company from all sides," they said. Profitability has edged closer, though. With the job cuts and other measures, the company said its financial breakeven point will arrive with quarterly revenue of $235 million and $240 million, which it achieved in three of its quarters in the last fiscal year. Previously, the breakeven point was $280 million to $290 million, Zellmer said. In the quarter now under way, SGI said it expects revenue of $220 million to $240 million, Zellmer said. Government customers always have been significant at SGI. In the most recent quarter, Bishop said SGI "received from the U.S. government a major order of great importance to homeland security," an order that includes Altix, storage and advanced visualization hardware. In addition, the company sold its largest visualization system ever to Los Alamos National Laboratory for nuclear weapons maintenance. Next on SGI's agenda is dealing with a $231 million convertible bond due in September. SGI failed in an earlier attempt to restructure the debt, but it is in negotiations with bondholders and expects to try a new restructuring effort this quarter, Zellmer said.
2001-09-05 - Services servers to challenge HP Compaq    By becoming a single company, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer hope to take on IBM and other big "S" companies--those involved in services, servers, software and storage. But with complex product lines offered by the two companies and their young services effort, that aspiration could be hard to achieve. A major part of HP's ambition is to give IBM "a competitor that's strong enough, bold enough, and talented enough to take them head-on in the enterprise space," CEO Carly Fiorina wrote in a letter to HP employees. These "enterprise" customers--big businesses that sign multimillion-dollar computing contracts--are a picky but well-funded bunch. In some respects, the new HP will be well-positioned to take advantage of any opportunity that comes its way. With Compaq under its wing, Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP will be one of the biggest makers of servers. Server sales typically open the door to consulting contracts, storage system sales and software licenses. "Their respective services businesses are highly regarded," said Mark Romanowski, senior vice president of client services and business development at AMC, a New York-based systems integrator. "The problem is that they will have to do a much better job marketing their capabilities, being less bureaucratic and inclusive of their partners." Absorbing Compaq, though, won't be easy. Compaq bought Digital Equipment in 1998 for its services group, and Compaq's transition to a consulting power has only just begun, according to various analysts. "It took IBM 20 years to make it a profitable business," said Robert Frances Group analyst Ed Broderick. "IBM's tens of thousands of consultants can outgun HP's 15,000 any day." The merger "seems to be such a daunting task," said Gary Griffiths, CEO of Evergreen, which specializes in a subscription-based PC management service. HP is an investor in Evergreen. Services: Key market HP has long been trying to improve its services business. It failed in November to close a deal to acquire PricewaterhouseCoopers for about $18 billion and since then has been emphasizing smaller partnerships with Accenture and PwC. The merger creates an in-house consulting group, but it's dwarfed by IBM's. In their most recent quarters, IBM received $8.7 billion--40 percent of its total revenue--from consulting services, while HP received $1.8 billion, or 15 percent of its total revenue, and Compaq had $1.7 billion from services, or 20 percent of revenue. However, the services revenue from HP and Compaq chiefly derives from providing maintenance work, not the more profitable consulting contracts IBM often signs with companies that want to revamp their computer operations. HP and Compaq have a total of 65,000 services employees, but about 40,000 are relatively unsophisticated repair people and 10,000 run outsourced computer operations, according to Broderick. That leaves about 15,000 in more lucrative consulting work. Terry Shannon, author of the Shannon Knows Compaq newsletter, said the acquisition is a good idea, but the combined company will have to bolster its consulting staff. "Clearly, where the growth opportunity is going to be is in the professional services space; they're going to have to hire more people or retrain some of their break-fix people," Shannon said. Another potential pitfall lies in competing with existing consulting firms. Last year, HP's Unix server sales were dented by competition between HP sales representatives and HP dealers. To solve the problem, HP imposed what it called a "hard deck." HP would sell servers directly to Fortune 1,000 companies; resellers would sell to the rest of the world. Some HP sales reps were also let go by the company, Mark Hudson, worldwide marketing manager for the business systems organization at HP, said earlier this year. HP may impose similar measures in its services strategy. Overall, HP tends to get fairly high marks from its network of integrators and dealers. Unlike Compaq, HP has placed less emphasis historically on direct sales. Compaq's dealer authorization programs could also be confusing and time consuming, according to Kenneth Catto at Pro-Desk Internet Business Consultants, which provides computers and networking to small businesses. IBM isn't the only competitor for HP, either. Sun Microsystems also has been boosting its services business, with annual revenue growth slowing from 40 percent to 50 percent to the mid-20 percent range in the most recent quarter, Chief Marketing Officer John Loiacono said. "It's the only area we're still investing in over the last two quarters," he said. Still, Sun could lose out to combined services efforts by HP and Compaq. "Sun is playing catch-up from a service and support standpoint," said Henkel Associates researcher Tom Henkel. "Now with these two entities combined, Sun starts to look mighty pale in terms of worldwide coverage." Contemplating servers Sun, as well as IBM, Dell Computer and storage maker EMC, looks stronger when it comes to servers and the pain HP and Compaq will endure sorting their product lines out, Eunice said. "If I were IBM or Sun or Dell, companies that have their act together, I would be dancing in the streets," said Jonathan Eunice, a consultant at Illuminata. "You're talking at least a year to two years of internal navel-gazing and dislocation as all these issues get sorted out." IBM is the top server maker, with 24 percent of the worldwide revenue for the first quarter of 2000, said IDC analyst Vernon Turner. HP, with 17 percent, is in second place, while Compaq, with 16 percent, is in third. But several say customers could move away from HP and Compaq during the acquisition period, eroding what could be the top share of the server market. "There's going to be a lot of stall in the market," said Broderick. "If you're an information-technology executive with an installed base of Compaq servers looking at a Compaq proposal, I'd question whether you'd sign it today." Gartner analyst George Weiss says the HP-Compaq deal seems to make sense in at least one area: consolidating the two companies' respective server designs and strategies. see commentary Key to keeping customers from fleeing to the more stable product lines of IBM or Sun will be providing a clear map of where technology is headed. Among the server lines the combined company would have to sift through are HP's Unix and MPE server lines; Compaq's Tru64, Tandem NonStop and OpenVMS lines; and both companies' Windows and Linux lines. Likely winners will be Compaq's ProLiant line of Intel servers, which are faring better than HP's competing NetServer products, and HP's 9000 series of Unix servers, which are farther down the path of conversion to Intel's Itanium chip than Compaq's Unix servers. But HP and Compaq can't just dump willy-nilly those projects that don't fit into the long-term strategy: High-end customers demand that servers be supported for years after they're purchased. It's nearly impossible to phase out older server technologies because customers use them for years, said Robert Frances Group CEO Cal Braunstein. "These things were always supposed to be dead yesterday," yet they linger on, he said. "Take how long it took Compaq to shoot Alpha," the chip at the heart of its Unix server line until the company shifted its designs to Intel's Itanium, Henkel said. "If they put the money invested in Alpha in a passbook savings account, they'd have a half-billion dollars just sitting there. Stuff like that, HP needs to reconcile quickly." The acquisition has long-term potential, though, Henkel said. And it will shorten the list of companies battling for top-end customers, said Technology Business Research analyst Brooks Gray. "The new company and IBM will basically own the glass house," the tightly controlled data center where a company's most important computers reside, Gray said.

2002-02-25 - ServerWorks vies for Intel servers' heart  Building the silicon plumbing inside Intel servers is becoming an increasingly competitive field, with Hewlett-Packard, Intel and Broadcom releasing new products this week. Each of the companies is debuting new server chipsets, the chips that connect CPUs (central processing units) to memory and input-output for networking and storage. If the processor is the brain of a computer, the chipset is the spinal cord that joins it to the rest of the body. Compared with processors, chipsets are cheap, selling at less than $100. Chipsets are essential supporting elements to back up the arrival of new CPUs--in this week's case, the "Prestonia" CPU from Intel that inaugurates the new Xeon server versions of the Pentium 4. The Xeon chips come with hyper-threading, a feature that lets a single CPU act a little like two. ServerWorks, a Broadcom subsidiary, is the powerhouse of the Intel server chipset market, with its products used in the most popular models from Dell Computer, Compaq Computer, IBM, HP and others. On Monday, the company will announce its Grand Champion LE (GC-LE) chipset at the Intel Developer Forum. The GC-LE chipset includes two PCI-X bridges running at 3.2 gigabytes per second each. The bridges create four channels for connecting the processor to network cards, storage systems and other devices. The chipset also has high-end memory features, including support for higher-speed double data rate (DDR) memory. Another feature lets computers have spare memory banks that are mirror images of the primary memory; the technique lets failed primary memory be replaced while the system is running. Intel also has a new chipset called the E7500, code-named Plumas, for Prestonia systems. Plumas accommodates six PCI-X channels compared with the GC-LE's four, but ServerWorks wins out in terms of data transfer capacity, said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. Consequently, the GC-LE likely will outperform Plumas. "There is a potential for bottlenecks between the PCI-X bridge and the Northbridge with the Intel chipset," Brookwood said. ServerWorks also plans to release the GC-HE, which will be used in systems to be released in March with the "Foster MP" version of Xeon for four-processor servers. Chief Executive Raju Vegesna said the GC-HE will be used in four-processor systems from 10 of the 10 largest server companies. The GC-LE is used by 9 of the 10, with only Dell bucking the trend. Dell, however, will use the more lofty GC-HE in its new PowerEdge 4600. Hewlett-Packard also has a new chipset of its own, the zx1, but for a different part of the market: forthcoming systems based on Intel's "McKinley" chip. McKinley is the second member of the Itanium processor family, a brand-new 64-bit architecture co-developed by HP and Intel that's still largely confined to limited testing uses. The zx1 will be used in systems with as many as four McKinley CPUs, HP plans to announce Monday at the Intel Developer Forum. The chipset also supports PCI-X and AGP 4x, a specialized graphics pathway. IBM and Compaq are working on their own chipsets as well. IBM's "Summit," now called the Enterprise X Architecture and used in the x360 server, is used to build four-Xeon systems with the Foster MP chip. Later, IBM will sell Summit systems joined together to form eight-processor, 12-processor and 16-processor servers. Compaq, meanwhile, has chipsets in the works for eight-CPU Foster MP systems and 32-processor McKinley systems.
2003-04-01 - Server-software company backs Itanium  SWsoft has released a new version of its Virtuozzo server software for Intel's Itanium processor, the company said Monday. Virtuozzo lets a single server act in some ways like several independent machines, and the software benefits from having the large amounts of memory that the 64-bit Itanium can accommodate more gracefully than 32-bit Xeon or Pentium computers can. Virtuozzo is often used by companies hosting many Web sites on one server. One customer using the product is USonyx, which is testing the market by using Virtuozzo to create the equivalent of 300 severs on a single Hewlett-Packard rx2600 Itanium 2 system.
2001-02-05 - Servers workstations beat PC sales slump   The buying slowdown that pummeled PC sales during the fourth quarter bypassed higher-margin systems, analysts say. Dataquest on Monday reported worldwide server shipments rose 21 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, while workstations posted a more modest 11.3 percent gain. Servers tied notebooks, which also beat the sales slowdown. This compares with fairly dismal PC shipments, which had, until midyear, posted strong double-digit growth. During the fourth quarter, Dataquest put worldwide PC shipments up a paltry 1.6 percent. For 2000, IDC concluded PC shipments grew only 0.3 percent over the previous year. Server shipments rose 14 percent year over year and workstations rose 11 percent during 2000, Dataquest concluded. Worldwide server shipments reached 3.9 million for the year, with 1.1 million units going out in the fourth quarter alone. Servers soar The U.S. server market plowed past the economic slowdown, with 32 percent growth during the fourth quarter 2000 over the same period a year earlier. "Most of the growth in the United States has been fueled by e-business and a resulting demand for front-end Web, Web application and database servers," Dataquest analyst Jeffrey Hewitt said in a statement. Sun Microsystems and Dell Computer saw phenomenal server growth--61.2 percent and 42.2 percent, respectively--last year compared with 1999. Compaq Computer, the volume mover, passed the 1 million mark for the first time. Compaq led the worldwide server market in 2000, with 27.1 percent market share, down from 28 percent a year earlier. Compaq server shipments rose 10.7 percent from 1999. IBM captured a far-distant second place, with 16.7 percent, down from 17.3 percent a year earlier, and 10.8 percent growth. Compaq shipped nearly 1.1 million servers in the quarter compared to IBM's around 658,000 units. Third-ranked Dell, with 14.6 percent market share, shipped about 573,000 servers last year. Hewlett-Packard saw modest growth of 4.2 percent and a decline in market share: 11.2 percent from 12.3 percent a year earlier. HP shipped about 440,000 servers. Palo, Alto, Calif.-based Sun pulled up the rear, gaining market share--7.3 percent from 5.2 percent in 1999--and shipping nearly 287,000 servers. Dataquest also noted that component shortages affecting supply in earlier quarters had virtually disappeared in the Intel-based server market. Still, the server sales situation is not all rosy. Market leader Compaq reported sales of its Intel-based ProLiant servers grew only about 25 percent during the fourth quarter, down from more than 40 percent growth the two previous quarters. This could indicate a slowing sales trend for the overall market. "Because of the length of typical server purchase cycles, the next two quarters will be critical in assessing the impact of the current economic situation on the server market," Hewitt said. No. 2 IBM is navigating an important product transition as it rebrands its server line and starts selling the long-awaiting G7 mainframe. At the same time, a crippling shortage of ceramics used in chips has prevented the Armonk, N.Y.-based company from meeting demand for some of its most profitable, high-performance systems. Workstation wrinkle Round Rock, Texas-based Dell, for the first time, pushed ahead of Sun in workstation shipments: 382,000 units to 357,000. Dell captured 23.1 percent of the market, up from 16 percent in 1999, with whopping 60.3 percent growth. Sun's share rose slightly--21.7 percent compared with the previous year's 21.6 percent--to 11.3 percent growth. HP fell to third place as the company continued its workstation decline, down 7.2 percent from 1999 with shipments of about 290,000 units. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company's market share dropped to 17.5 percent from 20.9 percent a year earlier. Compaq shipped about 230,000 workstations, for growth of 10.6 percent. But the Houston-based PC maker's share declined slightly year over year to 13.9 percent from 14 percent. IBM fell to fifth from fourth place, with 176,000 unit shipments--down 19.1 percent from a year earlier. The company's market share plummeted to 10.7 percent from 14.6 percent in 1999. Combined, computer manufacturers shipped 1.6 million workstations in 2000, Dataquest concluded. For the fourth quarter, the segments 11.3 percent growth rebounded from a weak third quarter, when workstation shipments grew a modest 3.9 percent. Workstations differ from PCs in a number of areas, the most important being two-processor capability. While not a mandatory facet of the category, the capability of using a second processor has been a distinguishing feature. Workstations also tend to offer beefier graphics, support for two monitors and more robust storage offerings, such as SCSI or RAID. The systems are typically used for demanding tasks, such as computer aided design (CAD), software development or video production, among others. Dataquest concluded that the introduction of the Pentium 4 processor, which offers enhanced audio and multimedia performance, could be a boost for the workstation market. But because Intel introduced Pentium 4 late in the fourth quarter, "the shipments were only in the hundreds," Dataquest analyst Pia Rieppo said in a statement. While Dataquest expects Pentium 4 sales to pick up during the first half, one defect could hurt sales: Intel does not yet offer chipsets enabling multi-processor Pentium 4 systems. This represents "a significant change in product positioning since dual processor scalability is a key component of current IA workstation definition," Rieppo said. She concluded that, "many end users may bypass these workstations and wait until the dual-processor chipsets and the Pentium 4 Xeon CPU arrives this spring." Clouds cover Dataquest warned that workstation sales in the United States, which accounts for more than half of shipments, could be weak during early 2001 because of the Pentium 4 situation, socioeconomic conditions and other factors. Overall, a dark cloud hangs over workstation and server sales during 2001: two important product transitions coming later in the year. Intel around midyear is expected to release its long-anticipated and much-delayed Itanium processors, which will be used in servers and workstations. Typically, pending new products slow or stall sales. IBM, for example, saw S/390 mainframe sales plummet 24 percent during the third quarter in anticipation of the z900 server. Big Blue shipped the server in mid December. More troubling may be the release of Microsoft's next version of Windows, code-named Whistler. The new operating system, rumored to be called Windows XP, won't come out until several months after Itanium's release. While Microsoft plans an interim 64-bit version of Windows 2000 for Itanium, the operating system confusion could conceivably hurt workstation and server shipments during the second half.
2003-04-22 - Servers benchmarks greet Opteron   Advanced Micro Devices released its touted Opteron processor on Tuesday, and a number of companies followed with servers, chipsets, software and benchmark scores. Server maker RackSaver, for instance, announced three servers, including the four-processor Quatrex-64, which beat all other four-processor servers on one key benchmark test and bested all but one other server on a second test. The Quatrex-64 managed 82,226 transactions per minute on the Transaction Processing Performance Council's TPC-C benchmark--second only to a four-processor Itanium server from Hewlett-Packard that scored 87,741. The next best system was another HP machine, which scored 77,905. Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64, noted that TPC-C is one of the benchmarks commonly used to compare systems. Similarly, the system beat out all others on the price/performance benchmark, which divides the transactions per minute by the cost of the machine. The Quatrex-64 pulled in a score of $2.76, just ahead of a single-processor Dell Computer system that scored $2.78. The HP Itanium system's price/performance benchmark was $5.03. Graphics chip designer Nvidia, meanwhile, unveiled its nForce 3 chipset for Opteron workstations, the company's first chipset for the corporate market. Earlier, Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, SuSE, Red Hat and IBM said they would come out with software for the chip. The long-awaited Opteron represents financially strapped AMD's best hope to date for selling chips for servers and other corporate computers. It can run 32-bit software, which is found on desktops and on one- and two-processor servers, and 64-bit software, found on high-end servers. Intel's Itanium can do the same thing, but to date the performance of 32-bit applications running on the chip has been poor. But a new version of Itanium, code-named Madison, will have technology geared to improve the performance. While much of the focus has been on the bilingual nature of the chip, AMD and its partners will tout Opteron's ability to handle 32-bit applications in the coming months. That's because servers running standard 32-bit software account for close to 90 percent of the market in terms of units shipped and for nearly half of the market's revenue. Initially, the chip will be used in two-processor servers because AMD's first chips--the Opteron 240, 242 and 244--are geared for two-way systems. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. Most of the Opteron servers coming out this week will be based on the Newisys 2100, which will start around $2,200 when configured with one processor. Newisys sells some computers but mostly licenses its designs to other manufacturers. The 2100 will hold up to two Opterons, two 36GB hard drives and 16GB of memory, said Kevin Baker, director of marketing for AMD. A typical configuration will come with two processors, two 36GB disks and 6GB of memory and sell for around $7,000. Microway, RackSaver and others will sell computers based around the 2100 design, Baker added. In the coming weeks, many of these companies will also begin to sell Opteron blade systems and four-processor systems based on Newisys designs. Technically, RackSaver is already selling the four-processor Quartrex, which starts at around $10,000, but customers that order now won't get delivery for 90 days, a RackSaver representative said. Although just being released, some of these systems are already running at select customers. A national security agency in North America has already deployed a number of Newisys-based servers in a pilot program, said Baker. Big computer makers are also looking at selling servers based on the Newisys design. "There are two top-tier OEMs who are most interested," Baker said, referring to original equipment manufacturers. Analysts speculate that IBM and Sun are contemplating selling such systems. Nvidia, meanwhile, hopes to capitalize on the popularity of its chipsets in the AMD-based PC market and of its graphics chips in general to propel sales of the nForce 3. About 70 percent of all workstations containing an Intel or AMD microprocessor also come with one of Nvidia's Quadro FX graphics chips, noted Drew Henry, general manager of the platform group at Nvidia. In addition, he said, the company now controls about 22 percent of the market for AMD chipsets--a figure that could rise to 50 percent by the end of the year. Getting into the corporate market, though, isn?t easy. "The drivers can't change a lot. You've got to make sure the (overall computer architecture) is stable," he said. To ease concerns, Nvidia is promising computer vendors that it will make the same chipsets and support the same original drivers for at least six quarters, Henry said. Meanwhile, Cadence Design Systems, which makes semiconductor design tools, announced it has ported its design-for-test (DFT) software to the AMD64 chip family.
2003-01-10 - Server start-up banks on 64-bit design Newisys, a server start-up founded by IBM alumni, is trying to hit the big time by bringing Advanced Micro Devices' chips to the corporate market. The Austin, Texas-based company hopes to make its mark by designing rack-mountable servers using AMD's forthcoming Opteron processor. Although a relatively small company, Newisys comes to the market with some interesting strengths. For one thing, rather than try to make money by building and selling machines itself, the company primarily plans to license its designs to partners that will manufacture the product under their own brand names. So far, about 50 of the machines with test versions of AMD's Opteron chip have been seeded out to various companies. Newisys said that three top-tier U.S. server makers are evaluating its design. "Our goal in life is to be a technology provider to those companies," Newisys CEO Phil Hester said, adding that as many as 1,000 servers will be in the field by launch time early this year. If successful, the licensing model could prove to be a boon for AMD--whose 2003 marketing strategy hinges on servers--and provide an avenue for Opteron into the Fortune 500. Opteron is expected to provide fairly strong performance. Server makers, though, are notoriously conservative and generally adopt new technology slowly. A Newisys design could let them bring an Opteron box to market without expending resources on research and development. Moreover, Newisys' executive team wields a well-connected Rolodex. Hester ran IBM's RS/6000 server program in the early 1990s. Rick Oehler, the company's chief technology officer, ran IBM's successful Enterprise X chipset program for Itanium and Xeon servers and was an IBM fellow. Former Dell Computer executives run sales and human resources. Mike Maples, a former executive vice president at Microsoft, sits on Newisys' board. Fidelity Ventures, the venture wing of the mutual fund giant, is an investor and has a board seat, too. Newisys, which is about 2 years old, has around 120 employees. "The company clearly has high-powered people in there," said Nathan Brookwood, president of consulting firm Insight 64, adding that besides connections, these executives understand the decision-making process inside the IBMs of the world--Newisys' potential customers. But the hardware market is notoriously tough on start-ups, and Newisys faces a number of obstacles in the conservative server market. Challenges range from establishing its name to launching a brand-new product based on a new chip and convincing big PC makers to adopt its design. A bumpy ride That ride has proven rough for some. RLX Technologies, for one, burst onto the scene in early 2001 with "blade" servers. The company, founded by former Compaq Computer executives, signed up IBM early on to resell the svelte devices. But once the blade server category became more established, most of the largest server manufacturers jumped in with their own blades based on their own designs, creating a much tougher environment for the start-up. IBM discontinued its deal with RLX and set out on its own, launching its BladeCenter product line in April. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems now have their own blade servers as well. But Newisys is using a slightly different approach, taking advantage of server manufacturers' tendency to work with outside designers and, in some cases, outside manufacturers. One precedent here was set by chipmaker Intel, which sells a line of components, including motherboards, enclosures and entire servers, to manufacturers for use in building or marketing Itanium 2 servers under their own names. Intel also designs Xeon servers for its customers. The hard part for Newisys will be proving its ability to deliver. But the company's designs are fairly sophisticated, Brookwood said, and take into account design methods and features that IBM or HP would use when targeting corporate customers--such as the abilities to resist crashing and to easily swap out components. "I think they differ from RLX in several key regards," he said. "They have a very different business model in that their aim is to license their design to some top-tier server OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), unlike RLX, which wants to sell hardware to those OEMs, who then resell it." The first product from Newisys will be a two-processor Opteron server. The company also is expected to introduce a four-processor server capable of connecting with other four-way servers to create machines with eight, 16 or more processors. The two-processor machine, designated 1U for its 1.75-inch thickness, will debut in tandem with the introduction of AMD's Opteron, which is expected later this quarter or early next quarter. Its four-processor sibling is expected later in the year. The new machines should be no more expensive than similar servers available now, Hester said, but they will offer companies the ability to run both 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems and applications. Even if companies don't plan to switch immediately to 64-bit software, Newisys or its customers can market the servers in part by emphasizing preparation for the future. For servers running large databases or other intensive applications, switching to 64-bit capabilities provides a performance boost by enabling the use of much larger amounts of memory. Once released, the Opteron chip is expected to run at about 2GHz. Analysts such as Brookwood believe it should be able to match an equivalent 3.5-to-4GHz Intel Xeon chip.
2001-11-19 - Server slalom Start your engines   Thinner but faster, more robust but cheaper. Some of the leading hardware companies are touting server plans, but it's a tight market.

2001-05-29 - Server makers tout new Itanium models  Intel launched its new 64-bit Itanium server chip with little fanfare on Tuesday, but major computer makers chimed in with a slew of new Itanium machines. Instead of holding a launch event at its Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters, Intel released a seven-paragraph statement. But computer makers Dell Computer, IBM and Hewlett Packard were quick to jump in with a host of Itanium workstations and servers based on the new high-end chip. Itanium was designed to provide a higher level of performance for workstations and servers doing heavy-duty work, such as computer aided design or encrypting and decrypting files. Wall Street had a muted response to Itanium's release, as Intel shares fell $1.25 to $27.85. They have traded as high as $75.81 in the past year. Itanium is seen as a key weapon in Intel's effort to challenge Sun Microsystems in the server market. High-end servers, where Sun dominates with systems based on its RISC processors, aren't expected to proliferate around Intel chips until the company comes out with ?"McKinley," the Itanium successor due next year. Some of the first machines to ship will be workstations, which manufacturers such as Dell will aim at scientific computing and design applications, among others. Dell's new Precision Workstation 730 will ship in June, according to the company. Its price will start at $7,999, with a single 733MHz Itanium chip, 1GB of memory and an 18GB hard drive. It will be loaded with a beta version of Microsoft's 64-bit Windows XP operating system. IBM also announced a new IntelliStation Z Pro model. The machine will also ship in June, for a starting price of $16,799, the company said. Hewlett-Packard said Tuesday that its new Workstation i2000 would ship with single- or dual-processor configurations. The company plans to offer two Itanium servers, the HP Server rx4610 with up to four processors and the HP Server rx9610 with up to 16 processors. The company said it will begin shipping the systems in late June for prices starting at $7,000. IBM will also offer a new Itanium server in its X380 series. The server will begin shipping in July with a starting price between $18,000 and $22,000, an IBM representative said. The machine will be capable of housing up to four processors and 64GB of memory. Dell has said that it will join the fray with a four-processor PowerEdge 7150 later this year. Compaq Computer and Gateway also are expected to offer servers at a later date. To date, Intel has shipped about 40,000 Itanium chips via sample and pilot programs. The chipmaker has said it expects eight to 10 PC makers to initially announce products based on the chip. Over the course of the year, Intel expects another 15 computer manufacturers to pick up Itanium, for a total of 25 companies shipping about 35 models. Meanwhile, the company has said to expect software makers to announce between 20 to 60 applications in the next few months. Over the course of the year, Intel expects developers to announce many more applications, for a total of about 400, an Intel representative said. Seven operating systems will be available for the chip, including the HP-UX and IBM's AIX-5L versions of Unix, Microsoft's Windows and 64-bit versions of Linux from Red Hat, Caldera, SuSE and TurboLinux. The OSes are in various stages of completion at this time.
2003-02-19 - Server makers power up roundup With an expanded set of server chips, Intel in 2003 plans to go after RISC chipmakers. Hewlett-Packard takes its server destiny in its own hands with the sx1000 chipset, while Big Blue works to generate some business buzz for utility computing with its server products. Intel set to expand server offers The company plans to come out with server chips tailored for every taste and budget in 2003 in a bid to take market share from other chipmakers such as Sun and IBM. February 19, 2003 Red Hat upgrade backs IBM Intel server The leading Linux seller quietly releases an updated version of its Advanced Server product that adds support for Big Blue's x440 server, an important expansion for both companies. February 18, 2003 IBM pumps up 'on-demand' power Big Blue bolsters its on-demand computing initiative with business partner programs and "express" versions of database, storage management and collaboration software. February 18, 2003 HP adds muscle to Itanium servers Two server components are expected to vastly increase the power of Hewlett-Packard's Itanium servers, making them on par with the machines using processors of HP's own design.

2002-09-11 - Server maker goes for Itanium 2    Server manufacturer RackSaver said Wednesday that it will adopt Intel's Itanium 2 processor for a new line of machines aimed at the high-performance computing market. RackSaver, which sells only rack-mounted servers for business, will begin shipping the new RS-4460 server during the fourth quarter. Like other rack-mounted servers, the new machines are designed to handle heavy-duty tasks like e-commerce transactions, but also to be relatively slim so that they fit into a cabinetlike enclosure. RackSaver already sells servers with Intel's Pentium 4 and Xeon processors as well as with Advanced Micro Devices' Athlon XP and Athlon MP processors. It chose to offer the Itanium 2, announced in July, because of the performance demands of customers in the high-performance computing (HPC) market, CEO David Driggers said. "HPC customers are looking for heavy-duty FPU performance," Driggers said. The FPU, or floating-point unit, lets a chip perform mathematical calculations. Early tests conducted by Intel showed that Itanium 2 offers roughly twice the performance of its predecessor, Itanium. High-performance computing takes place in many different fields, including moviemaking and exploring for new oil and gas reserves. Companies in these industries often use large groups of heavy-duty computers, known as clusters, to tackle big computing jobs. Clusters tie standard computers, such as the RackSaver servers, together with switches and storage systems, creating supercomputers on the cheap. This practice is becoming more popular: Such setups are inexpensive relative to actual supercomputers, they can be built using off-the-shelf parts, and they can be easily upgraded. RackSaver will join Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Unisys and others in the market for Itanium 2 servers. The company will offer its RS-4460 with Itanium 2 processors running at both 900MHz and 1GHz and featuring either 1.5MB or 3MB of Level 3 cache, memory that stores data close to the processor's core. The San Diego-based company will follow the RS-4460 with a dual Itanium 2 rack mount server by the first quarter of 2003. RackSaver has not yet announced pricing or detailed configurations of the new machines. Meanwhile, Intel showed off Madison, the successor to the Itanium 2, this week at its Developer Forum in San Jose, Calif.

April 22, 2003 AMD rolls dice on Opteron chip Bringing the processor to market hasn't been easy. But on Tuesday, Advanced Micro Devices will release the new chip--and once again, everything is on the line. April 21, 2003 Sun plans software support for Opteron Sun Microsystems' software products will support AMD's new Opteron--but not initially the chip's 64-bit capabilities that distinguish it from rival Intel processors. April 21, 2003 SuSE offers Linux for Opteron The company releases a version of Linux tuned for AMD's Opteron processor, set to launch Tuesday, with rival Red Hat planning its own product for the fall. April 21, 2003Opteron heading for four-way servers Servers containing up to four of the processors will hit the market later this quarter, a key element in Advanced Micro Devices' strategy to penetrate the corporate market. April 21, 2003 previous coverage HP toots Itanium horn Hewlett-Packard boasts of progress in establishing the merits of its servers using Intel's server processor less than a week before AMD is scheduled to release its rival Opteron chip.

2002-05-15 - Sending a wake-up call to the W3C  When it was founded in 1994, the World Wide Web Consortium was entrusted with developing standards and policies that would enable the Internet to reach its full potential. An explicit goal was to facilitate what was described as a "Web of trust" that would help guide the Internet's development "with careful consideration for the novel legal, commercial, and social issues raised by this technology." However important Internet trust seemed in 1994, it is even more critical in a post-WTC world. Most everyone I talk to thinks the Web must become implicitly trustworthy if it's to reach its full potential. I use the word trust intentionally because it means more than security. Trust is also about dependability, privacy, data integrity, and authentication. Trust is a system-class concept that cannot be adequately addressed by point technologies. If there is a coming golden age for the Web, then trust has to be stitched into its fabric. I want to suggest a path for achieving this. Let's begin with what needs to be fixed. First, the open nature of the Web has changed everything. The Web is a deliberately blurred set of abstractions in which computer hardware, communications networks, system software, middleware and applications connect, cooperate and disconnect. All of the trusted components in my local environment can be easily subverted by untrustworthy components I may need to rely upon to complete a task. Building, for example, a highly trusted desktop in a Web-connected world is like building steel doors in a house with paper walls. The headlong rush to Web services is going to make things worse. On top of the new vulnerabilities sometimes created by the fixes, nobody has real confidence in ad hoc trust features and functions. Second, the current "break and fix" approach toward trust and security cannot sustain the improvements I am talking about. On top of the new vulnerabilities sometimes created by the fixes, nobody has real confidence in ad hoc trust features and functions. Without precisely defined trust models, users cannot know what exactly is being claimed relative to threats that have not yet occurred. The discussion also needs to shift from "cost benefit" to "table stakes." Without system-class trust models, investing in even simple trust technologies is--at best--insurance against events of unknown probabilities. At worst, it's another set of steel doors in paper walls. In reality, we don't know the levels of trust that we need for getting into Web services, utility computing, or mobility games. I believe that since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, the table stakes have been raised. Web resources are only barely manageable today. Adding trust as a quality-of-service guarantee will push things over the edge. The number of devices connecting and disconnecting to our shared infrastructure will surely keep doubling for some time to come. Advances in nanotechnology could well result in Avogadro's number of hosts all assigned to a specific life-critical task. There is simply no way to scale existing performance management technology to such an environment. One solution for addressing trust in today's world is to build a chain of trust where each link is strong but also connects to its neighbor by verifying its trustworthiness. In particular, beginning with a priori grounding in a physically trustworthy base, each link of the chain checks signature-based trust tokens of its neighbor before the chain is allowed to carry any weight. Such a chain begins with processors and extends to operating systems to applications to interconnect protocols, and ultimately, to end users. Fix it! I believe a first link in this chain will come from addressing the core vulnerabilities deep in computing and network infrastructure--the underpinnings of the Web. Such a program, if adopted by the major technology companies, would lead to a fundamental shift in trust for the Internet. Web resources are only barely manageable today. Adding trust as a quality-of-service guarantee will push things over the edge. The Trusted Computing Platform Alliance architecture represents an industrywide effort to provide secure hardware platforms, which is the essential first link in any IT trust chain. Using Itanium's inherent security features (for example, an additional two layers of privilege protection at the microprocessor level), Hewlett-Packard is building a secure platform architecture on top of the Itanium architecture. We think it makes great sense to do this in the town square by calling on the trust-enhancing ability of the open-source community with its rigorous peer review, open publishing and testing methodologies. That is one reason why Linux will be the first operating system we'll port to SPA. The W3C may not be directly involved in designing and regulating these industry-standard building blocks and open architectures. But it is quite deeply involved in creating the standards for how they all interoperate. The opportunity to extend the chain of trust beyond a secure platform and extend it into Web-based platforms is where the W3C can significantly contribute to the chain--architecting trust into new links via its influence over next-generation protocols. Ultimately, this will create the opportunity for the Web to escape the cycle it is currently caught in, paving the way for it to thrive and prosper.
2003-01-22 - Semi survival  Soaring costs of chipmaking recast industry By Michael Kanellos Staff Writer, CNET News.com January 22, 2003, 4:00 a.m. PT Survival in the semiconductor market will soon depend on having friends in high places. The exploding costs of fabrication facilities, or fabs, combined with technical hurdles surrounding the design of the next generation of chips, are creating a bifurcation that will change the face of the industry, executives and analysts say. On one side will be Intel and a select few that can afford their own fab plants--which will cost between $2.5 billion and $3 billion to build in 2003 and $6 billion by 2007--and perform basic research on transistor design or new chip materials. These new fabs will process wafers with 300-millimeter diameters, larger and more complex to make than today's 200-millimeter variety. On the other side will be everyone else. They will have to share fabs, pool research, buy technology or rely more heavily on outside foundries, which in turn will have to seek help. "It's becoming almost impossible for the smaller semiconductor companies--smaller being anything less than an Intel or a Texas Instruments or an NEC--to afford these 300-millimeter fabs on (their) own nickel," said Brian Halla, chief executive of National Semiconductor. "What you are going to see is more and more partnerships." Historically, companies spend 20 percent to 30 percent of revenue on capital expenditures, meaning that a fab can be justified only if it costs about one-third or less of annual revenue. In 2002, only Intel and Samsung, with about $23 billion and $9 billion in annual sales, respectively, could spring for new fabs. Related story A fab construction job Rebuilding an IBM chipmaking facility proves no easy task. In this tough economy, even Intel has scaled back estimates for capital spending in 2003, a move that had repercussions far beyond the chip industry. Because Wall Street views Intel as a bellwether, stocks fell after the chipmaker announced its capital forecast even though the company beat analysts' revenue expectations in its quarterly report last week. Other large manufacturers will need outside help to make their chips. TI and Infineon, the German memory maker, have said they will outsource some production to Shanghai's Semiconductor Manufacturing International. Motorola, ST Microelectronics (the world's third-largest chipmaker), Philips and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), are collaborating on a wide variety of ventures: how to build 300-millimeter factories, designs for new types of memory and techniques for making 90-nanometer chips, among other projects. "It takes a lot more horsepower to get these technology road maps to hit on target," said Alex Pepe, vice president and director of strategy for technology and manufacturing in Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector, which is increasing its partnerships to cut costs. Motorola's Austin, Texas-based chip division is in many ways emblematic of the trend. In 1998, the company operated 25 fabs and 15 sites for testing and assembling chips. By the end of the year, Motorola will have eight fabs and two test centers. Any future factories will be built jointly with others, while outsourcing manufacturing--around 20 percent now--will likely increase. Cooperative research and development will also become norm, Pepe said. Motorola will increasingly license its technology to start-ups, large companies and even equipment makers, for financial gain. In this new era, Intel could gain an even greater opportunity to undercut opponents or enter new markets because of its unique self-sufficiency. Asian foundries such as TSMC, meanwhile, will grow in power, and IBM may become the de facto R&D department for an array of semiconductor companies. Other chipmakers may simply fade away. "There is going to have to be some consolidation in the industry," said AMD Chief Executive Hector Ruiz, whose company obtained manufacturing techniques from IBM and will likely co-own its next factory with another company. "Outside of Intel, I don't know who could do it (alone). There has to be a coalition." Rule of the Rock The harsh realities come partly as the byproduct of Rock's Law. Named after venture capitalist Arthur Rock, this dictum holds that the cost of building a semiconductor fab will double every four years, according to Dan Hutcheson, CEO of VLSI Research, which tracks the semiconductor-equipment industry. In 1985, a fab that processed wafers with 5-inch diameters cost about $100 million, Hutcheson said, and the average size of components on the chip measured a micron, or 1,000 nanometers. The $3 billion megafabs coming online now process wafers with diameters of 300 millimeters, or 12 inches, and will contain components that average around 90 nanometers. (A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.) Hutcheson said the cafeteria at one of these new fabs could cost more than an entire plant of years past. "The costs are getting outrageous. That is driving some fundamental structural change," he said. The $3 billion price tag is largely soaked up by equipment. Lithography machines used for "drawing" circuit lines can cost $17 million or more each and weigh 40,000 pounds. Just getting equipment in the door can take months. The payoff comes in vastly improved efficiency: New, expensive fabs produce far more chips at a lower cost. The semiconductor industry accounted for about $22 billion in revenue in 1985, when about 2,700 fabs were in operation. In 2002, the industry amassed $139 billion in revenue out of 600 fabs. Still, greater productivity creates risks of equal size. If a company builds a $3 billion megafab, it needs to find customers for all the cheaper, smaller chips it can suddenly make in far larger volumes. If that doesn't happen, operating expenses will send the company into the red. Aside from Intel and Samsung, according to a recent survey from iSuppli, every other semiconductor manufacturer in the world pulled in $6 billion or less in revenue, making them candidates to seek outside help to make chips. Many are still trying to unload factories and real estate acquired in the last boom. "What the industry is faced with is very significant capital costs, very high revenue requirements, and very basic changes in process technology," said Sumit Sadana, director of strategy for IBM Microelectronics. "The financial health of most of the companies in the industry is not pristine, to put it nicely." Fabs vs. foundries So why own a fab? To control your own destiny. Products can be delayed, advanced or tweaked at will, while production can be monitored constantly. "You get to (determine) your own capacity. You don't have to wait in line. You don't have to pay someone's margin, and you absolutely have the lowest costs," Intel President Paul Otellini said. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company believes this strategy will pay off this year when it starts making chips on the 90-nanometer process. The same 90-nanometer factories will be capable of manufacturing microprocessors, communications chips, and subsequently flash memory and other products. Intel will also incorporate communications functions into processors. In other words, whatever chips it wants to mix and match, it can. Concurrently, by using the same production lines for a wider variety of chips, the company can insulate itself from owning idle, excess capacity, thus reducing costs. Foundry customers, by contrast, have to pay for their services while shuttling back and forth to Taiwan. In addition, foundries have at times had more difficulty than autonomous manufacturers in adopting new technologies or manufacturing methods, Hutcheson and others say. TSMC's move from the 180-nanometer chipmaking process to the 130-nanometer process proved difficult and contributed to delays for products from Transmeta and others. Semiconductor designers can also lose their edge by relying too much on foundries. "I have not yet seen anyone who has taken a 0.13-micron process (from a foundry) and done well," said Syed Ali, CEO of Cavium Networks, which designs processors that perform security functions in chips. Many chip start-ups, he said, are staffed with engineers who "have never seen a transistor under a microscope." Cavium outsources manufacturing to TSMC but places heavy emphasis on circuit design. The company also employs a number of old-timers: Many at Cavium, Ali added, worked on Digital's semiconductor division in the preceding decade. Nevertheless, foundries are rapidly growing in sophistication and importance. Collectively, they will grow by 31 percent annually and likely account for 40 percent to 50 percent of the world's semiconductor output by 2010, said Chuck Byers, director of worldwide marketing for Taiwan Semiconductor. He said TSMC will start making 90-nanometer chips around the same time as Intel, adding that neither company is immune from the difficulty of shrinking chips. Part of the reason the gap is closing between fabs and foundries is that semiconductor-equipment makers have shifted from selling basic equipment to delivering more nearly complete solutions that can be put on production lines fairly rapidly. "You (just) don't buy the hardware anymore. You get a recipe for the chemistry and then you fine-tune the equipment to yield what you want," AMD's Ruiz said. "It is like a machine gun...Today, the equipment guys are very powerful." Driven by research Even if manufacturing parity can be achieved, however, smaller companies are going to face a problem because of the changing nature of chip design. For more than 30 years, designers have increased the performance of their chips by shrinking and simultaneously doubling the number of transistors on their products--a la Moore's Law, which dictates that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years. But the shrinking of transistors is hitting a wall, and to keep the gains from Moore's Law on track, designers are being forced to come up with creative solutions: strained silicon, silicon-on-insulator, and double- and triple-gate transistors. "The foundries are entering a precarious time right now. While they see all these companies going asset-light, they face a large R&D effort in process technology to stay a step within Intel and IBM," Big Blue's Sadana said. "You will see fewer and fewer companies majoring in process innovation." Special report China awakes to new destiny The chip industry and others are finding gold in the emerging economy. The equalizer here could be IBM. Although Big Blue's microelectronics division pulls in only about one-eighth of the revenue of Intel's, the two remain close rivals when it comes to research. In fact, IBM has achieved many of the touted milestones first and has increasingly become interested in getting money out of its breakthroughs. In IBM's deal with Chartered Semiconductor, the two companies will work together to develop processes for 90-nanometer and 65-nanometer manufacturing, a move that will effectively open Big Blue's labs to Chartered and its customers. Similarly, Chartered will be able to postpone opening a 300-millimeter fab while IBM will be able to fill its plant with new customers because the factories of the two companies will be equivalent. Sony will also rely on IBM to provide intellectual property and manufacturing expertise for the "cell" processor that will likely go into the next version of PlayStation. Sony with Toshiba designed its own chip for PlayStation 2. The catch: IBM charges significantly for such arrangements. AMD, for example, could pay hundreds of millions under its deal with Big Blue, according to one source. And TSMC says the R&D centers of the world are ignoring a bigger factor: Companies can't afford to integrate these complex technologies into their chips. Some TSMC customers refrained on moving to 130-nanometer production because the cost estimates didn't justify the move. "We have reached a point as an industry where our ability to innovate now exceeds our ability to profitably capitalize on that innovation," Byers said. "This is all very sexy stuff, but it is going to be expensive and someone is going to have to pay for it." Collateral effects How a company wiggles out of the dilemma will depend on a variety of circumstances. Smaller companies with $1.5 billion or less in revenue will likely have to get their manufacturing and a significant portion of their R&D from outside. Their parts will also be integrated into those from larger manufacturers. Larger, more established companies with revenue between $3 billion and $5 billion will develop hybrid models. National Semiconductor, for instance, designs its own chips but then has TSMC draw the manufacturing model and build prototypes. Subsequently, National takes the chips back and performs mass manufacturing. "In the olden days, it used to be intellectual property drove everything," Halla said, adding that National will outsource some, but never all, of its chips. "Now, you've got to do your manufacturing with a great deal of finesse as well." To that end, the Philips-ST-Motorola research alliance somewhat resembles a U.N. peacekeeping mission. The common research facility is managed by three executives--one from each company--and each critical engineering project has key technologists from each company. Partnerships, though, aren't always easy. In 2002, AMD entered a multiyear agreement to develop manufacturing technology with United Microelectronics and co-build a fab in Singapore with the company. This month, AMD said it ended the technology deal, struck the new one with IBM, and is looking at new partners for building a fab. Consolidation will likely be a fact of life for many small to midsized companies. Hutcheson, though, noted that history seems to indicate that the odds won't discourage new companies from trying to break into the business. "Semiconductors are like the airline industry," he said. "They are sexy, and investors are always willing to lose money on the airline industry."

2007-03-20 - Secure64 debuts Itanium server appliance   Secure64, a start-up that employs a leading designer of the Itanium processor that Hewlett-Packard and Intel jointly brought to the market, released on Monday its first product: software to build secure network servers. The Greenwood Village, Colo.-based company announced software that combines its customized SourceT operating system for Itanium servers with widely used network infrastructure software. The bundle is geared for attack-proof operation of the Domain Name System (DNS)--the Internet standard that connects Web addresses such as Secure64.com into the numeric equivalents that network equipment uses. And the company is unafraid of making bold claims about its products. "We've created a hardware platform that is immune to all forms of malware--rootkits, Trojans, viruses and worms," said Mark Beckett, vice president of marketing. In addition, he said, "it protects itself against network attacks, and it's very high performing." The software runs an HP's lowest-end Itanium server, an Integrity rx2660 with one dual-core Itanium 2 9000 "Montecito" processor that costs about $5,000 to $6,000, Beckett said. The software itself costs $9,995; Secure64 will sell the hardware and install the software if customers desire, but ultimately the company plans to sign up a network of resellers to package the products and sell them to customers. The chief technology officer at Secure64 is Bill Worley, an Itanium architect from the days the chip began as an HP research project. Secure64 was founded in 2002, has about 25 employees and now is hiring sales and marketing staff to bring its product to market, Beckett said. The product is reasonable, Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff said, but Secure64 might have better luck if it can enlist HP to sell its wares. "I think a true appliance sold and supported by HP would be their best play," Haff said. "An appliance play is entirely consistent with the way that HP is de-emphasizing Itanium in Integrity. Itanium is a good foundation but not the soul of the product." DNS is one of many essential Internet services, but servers that handle the translation can be degraded if bombarded with heavy traffic known as a denial-of-service attack. Secure64's technology weeds out such attacks. Using the company's modified version of the open-source NSD software, Secure64's servers maintain more than 100,000 queries per second even under a denial-of-service attack, the company said. NSD on Linux on the same hardware drops from a top speed of about half that to virtually zero under attack, while the widely used BIND software for DNS drops from about a third at top speed to zero. Itanium failed to meet its initial promise of becoming a ubiquitous server processor, though it has caught on as a replacement for earlier HP processors. But it has features that make Secure64's software possible, Beckett said. These features permit a computer, for example, to compartmentalize memory so one application can't access another's data or to prevent specific data written in memory or in the chip's processing "stack" from being executed. In addition, software can be authenticated as the computer boots to make sure it hasn't been tampered with, Beckett said. It wasn't simple finding a way to bring the company's products to market. "There was a point in time where the big challenge for the company was figuring out what the right business model was," Beckett said. Secure64's advantages extend to any application running on the SourcT operating system, and the company has tested some of those applications in its labs, Beckett said. SourceT also could theoretically be used as a foundation for a mainstream operating system, though the company hasn't tested that, he said. The company plans more software this year, Beckett said. "Expect to see enhancements to this (DNS) product and other offerings coming throughout 2007."
2003-04-16 - SCO ships Linux for Itanium    SCO Group, which gained notoriety for a Linux-related lawsuit it filed against IBM last month, released a version of Linux for Intel's Itanium processor family on Tuesday. The Lindon, Utah-based company's product costs $999 for systems with as many as four Itanium 2 processors and includes a one-year subscription to SCO's software update service. The software is based on version 1.0 of the Linux distribution from the UnitedLinux consortium, which includes SCO Group, SuSE, Conectiva and Turbolinux. The companies formed the consortium to counter the influence of dominant Linux seller Red Hat. Operating systems for Intel's high-end Itanium chip family are a sore point for SCO, which had collaborated with IBM on an Itanium version of SCO's UnixWare called Project Monterey. The collaboration took place before SCO was acquired by Linux seller Caldera Systems, which last year adopted the SCO name. But IBM abandoned Project Monterey in favor of Linux, a move that frustrated SCO and that eventually made its way into SCO's lawsuit against IBM. Among other things, SCO accused IBM of using Project Monterey as a mechanism to misappropriate trade secrets for running Unix on Intel processors--information that Big Blue then allegedly used to improve how Linux runs on Intel processors. The lawsuit has triggered a hostile response against SCO among some in the Linux community. For example, the Linux news site PCLinuxOnline is urging a boycott of SCO products. Two weeks ago, SCO warned that the lawsuit might hurt its business and alienate some in the computing industry. Indeed, SuSE, the SCO business partner that develops the UnitedLinux software SCO relies on, said it is reevaluating its relationship with SCO because of the lawsuit. But SCO is sticking to its Linux business, even though most of its sales come from its Unix products. SCO Linux Server 4.0 for Itanium chips includes remote management features, clustering capabilities to let one system take over if another fails and security auditing tools. The software is available now.
2012-08-03 - SAP to pay 306M to Oracle after infringement fight Oracle has won at least one legal battle this week. SAP is paying the hardware giant $306 million in damages resulting from a copyright infringement suit. Unlike the fight against Google, it looks like victory over SAP really is a payday. SAP's bill to Oracle continues to get bigger as Oracle's general counsel Dorian Daley said in a statement that SAP will have to pay "a minimum of $426 million, including attorneys fees." Oracle originally filed the lawsuit in 2007 against SAP, arguing that SAP downloaded and copied intellectual property. The case didn't go to trial until 2010. In 2011, SAP pleaded guilty to criminal chargesin federal court for its illegal activity and paid a fine to U.S. Department of Justice. Thursday's ruling also means that Oracle's unanimous 2010 jury verdict awarding it $1.3 billion can now be immediately taken to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. SAP also paid Oracle $120 million in attorneys' fees shortly after the trial began. This is good news for Oracle -- especially after the Redwood Shores, Calif.-based corporation lost in a legal war with Hewlett-Packard at the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara on Wednesday. In that case, it was ruled that Oracle did have a responsibility to continue to offer its products on HPs Itanium-based server platforms until HP discontinued sales of Itanium-based servers. This story was first posted as "SAP paying $306M to Oracle after infringement battle" at ZDNet's Between the Lines.
2002-08-06 - Rivals scrap for supercomputer buyers  The overall server market may be suffering, but makers of high-end supercomputers continue to find specialized niches such as biotechnology or government research where customers still are buying equipment. Among those scrapping for attention in the market this week are Dell Computer, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Linux NetworX and SGI. Supercomputers, which often sell for millions of dollars, are a ray of hope for companies such as these that have been hurt by the shrinking server market. IBM, which has one of the most aggressive supercomputer programs, announced preconfigured servers, storage systems, services and software geared particularly for biotechnology buyers, organizations focused on tasks such as developing new drugs based on human genetic information. The IBM system includes its Unix servers, DB2 database software, mid-range storage systems, management software and services. Meanwhile, Dell is using Linux and Windows to try to reach into prestigious customer accounts. Dell, in cooperation with Microsoft and Intel, announced an agreement to give the Cornell Theory Center $60 million worth of Dell servers over four years. The companies expect to benefit from the donation in part by gaining expertise in running Microsoft's operating systems and database software in high-performance environments and in translating Unix and Linux software common in the academic world to Windows. The center also will help Intel test its new Itanium processors. Dell isn't just pushing Windows, though. MTU Aero Engine, which builds airplane engines, has bought a cluster of 64 Linux servers from Dell for its design work. Each server in the cluster has two Pentium III processors and will run SuSE's version of Linux, the companies said. Linux NetworX, which unlike Dell specializes in joining large numbers of Linux servers into supercomputers, is among those to tap into the biotechnology market. Pharmaceutical maker Tularik plans to use the servers to speed the gene identification research part of its drug discovery work. The total system includes 150 processors, the company said. SGI, a company that has always focused on high-end customers but has struggled in recent years, announced several deals Monday. Among them are Lockheed Martin Aeronautics for work on the Joint Strike fighter jet, the National Cancer Institute for biology, chemistry and anthrax research; Los Alamos National Laboratory for climate research; and TWR for automotive design work. DaimlerChrysler placed a $6.4 million order with SGI to upgrade a center where computer designs can be evaluated on giant screens. Danish Broadcasting also placed a $6.5 million order for a digital newsroom project for sharing sound and video information for radio, television and Internet operations. And the National Supercomputer Center in Sweden expanded its system to 128 processors and 128GB of memory, though the system has crashed several times recently.
2004-02-11 - Return of the prodigal Sun SAN FRANCISCO--Nine years after leaving the server maker he co-founded in 1982, Andy Bechtolsheim is returning to Sun Microsystems. Sun's co-founder returns to the foldScott McNealy, CEO, Sun Microsystems At Sun, Bechtolsheim will pick up where he left off: designing computers. This time, he'll be working to share more technology between servers that use Sun's UltraSparc processors and those using Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron processor, he said in an interview after a radiant Chief Executive Scott McNealy welcomed the co-founder back during Sun's analyst conference here. Not surprisingly, Sun executives were much more enthusiastic in talking about Bechtolsheim's return than about the 2003 departure of another co-founder, Bill Joy. "Andy is going to be a resource for every designer at Sun," McNealy said. Bechtolsheim, 48, left Sun in 1995 to start Granite Systems, which built 1-gigabit-per-second networking technology and which Cisco acquired in 1996. Everybody has a little more gray hair, including myself. But we got more efficient with age. The new era here is nonreligious. He'll rejoin Sun through its planned acquisition of Kealia, a start-up that builds Opteron servers. Although Bechtolsheim co-founded Kealia in 2001, he didn't formally join it until December, when he left Cisco Systems. "It's pretty cool to see two pioneers reunite," said Robert Frances Group analyst Ed Broderick, referring to the two executives. McNealy, he said, is buying not just Kealia's intellectual property but also "a confidant." Although executives remained mum about Kealia's products and how they'll fit in at Sun, Bechtolsheim shared his thoughts about his sudden homecoming with CNET News.com. Q: Why did you leave Sun? A: Back then, I saw an opportunity in gigabit Ethernet. I founded a company Cisco ended up buying. Now, I see an opportunity in servers, of all things. I think that what has been missing to ignite the market is the next level of cost performance. As these things come to market, (customers) will upgrade. What's different about Sun that you would rejoin the company? Everybody has a little more gray hair, including myself. But we got more efficient with age. The new era here is nonreligious. There are incredible opportunities with Sparc-Solaris and with Linux-Opteron. It's not exclusionary. That's what made it attractive to me. In the past, Sun just sold UltraSparc systems, but customers, in the end, want other solutions. What will your role be at Sun, and what will you do? I'll be chief architect of the Volume Systems Products group. I like efficiency. I think that I can help by making things faster with a larger group. Neil Knox's Volume Systems Products group is one of the smallest at Sun. This is all about execution. There's going to be one chip coming after the next. At Cisco, you were a networking technology executive, and now, Sun is bringing more networking into its gear, with its blade servers and with its planned acquisition of Nauticus. Will you continue that network work at Sun? No. That was my previous job. Will you be picking up the screwdrivers and soldering irons and building new servers? I like to work with the engineers and will do so at Sun. Part of efficiency is that you don't have to reinvent the wheel. Besides continuing with Opteron work, I'll also closely work with other parts of Neil's organization. There's a great opportunity to accelerate Sparc. You said today that Kealia's systems will be certified to run Windows as well as Linux and Solaris. Sun won't touch Windows servers with a 10-foot pole. What do you think of selling Windows servers? It's really hard to add value to Windows. Whatever you add, Microsoft is going to take away from you. Linux has opportunities. There are many ways to add value. There are lots of things Sun customers expect that are missing from Linux. What is Opteron's performance? Is it easier to design servers with Opteron than other chips? Opteron has the industry-leading benchmarks, except for floating-point mathematical calculations, for which Itanium is faster. If you look at SPECweb99 or CINT2000, Opteron is the fastest CPU. Advanced Micro Devices did really well. What about Opteron system design? It's fairly straightforward. But you still have to make the right choices, whether it's two-way (a two-processor server), four-way or eight-way.

2000-01-27 - Reliance Computer renames deals with Intel Reliance Computer has renamed itself ServerWorks and unveiled a key partnership with its biggest rival: Intel. The company, competing in a little-regarded but vitally important chip market, has signed a deal with the industry's hegemon in hopes of staying ahead of the curve. Like Intel and smaller companies such as Via Technologies and SiS, ServerWorks, based here, makes chipsets, the critical chips that connect central processing units (CPU) with everything else in computers--such as memory, network cards, hard disks and graphics cards. The move, intended to help the company keep up with Intel's current and future CPUs, provides ServerWorks with access to the technical specifications of the "bus," or data pathway, used to talk to the CPU. The agreement runs through 2008, according to executives. Though it would seem otherwise, it's not paradoxical for a company to be an Intel competitor and partner simultaneously. "Intel is willing to sign an agreement with anybody who will help them sell more microprocessors," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. Legal squabbles with Intel have hampered the chipset efforts of Via and SiS, but ServerWorks is confident it will be able to stay on the company's good side, said Kimball Brown, vice president of business development at ServerWorks. "We have a fabulous relationship with the CPU team," he said. The agreement coincides with a corporate name-change, which had been expected, and the unveiling of a new Web site. ServerWorks hopes to raise its profile in order to prepare for an initial public offering, planned for later this year, and to attract new customers, said chief executive Raju Vegesna. As the new name would suggest, ServerWorks seems most interested in high-end computing systems. In servers, Brown argues, the CPU is in charge, but the chipset often is the workhorse, transferring information among the network, the hard disk and memory. Chipsets may never have as high a profile as CPUs, Vegesna added, but the features will be in great demand. For instance, the next-generation ServerSet IV will enable the higher-speed PCI-X technology for plugging in network cards and other peripherals as well as "hot plug" methods of swapping out faulty memory or PCI cards without shutting a computer down, Vegesna said. Higher-speed double-data-rate memory also is planned. ServerWorks' current ServerSet III chipset is used in two-processor servers from Intel, Dell, IBM and Compaq, the largest manufacturers of Intel servers. But much of the 85-person company's attention is focused on the next generation of chips from Intel, code-named Foster and due later this year. Foster will provide a new core to replace the current Pentium design, which has been used for years. But more important for ServerWorks, it will provide a new and faster bus that will speed communications between the CPU and its surrounding hardware. Current Pentiums allow communication rates of 800 megabytes per second. The Foster bus will enable rates four times that, 3.2 gigabytes per second. Future chipsets from ServerWorks designed to work with Intel's "McKinley" chip, due in late 2001, will enable speeds of 5 gigabytes per second, Brown said. McKinley is the sequel to Itanium, Intel's first crack at a 64-bit processor. Brown said ServerWorks won't make a chipset for Itanium, which was code-named Merced. "We're not going to invest in Merced," he said. "We believe that it's a development platform." As previously reported, ServerWorks is targeting the server appliance market. A server appliance is configured in advance to do a specific job, making it faster, cheaper or easier to use than a general-purpose server. Brown said server appliances, while not as powerful as general-purpose systems, are usually good enough for a job. And some types of server appliances--specifically the ultra-thin ones bolted by the dozens to racks--will become more powerful when Intel starts shipping thinner "flip-chip" designs, Brown said. Those chips will enable two-processor systems 1.75 inches tall, half the thickness of current systems.
2003-04-25 - Red Hat warms to Itanium-booster plan  Leading Linux seller Red Hat is looking fondly at an Intel technology that improves the ability of the chipmaker's Itanium processor to run older software written for Xeon or Pentium chips. The software, called the IA-32 Execution Layer, lets the new 64-bit Itanium processor emulate the two older 32-bit processors' workings. Intel says the technique is faster than the current, little-used approach of sluggish special-purpose circuitry in Itanium, endowing the forthcoming 1.5GHz Itanium 2 6M to run 32-bit software with about the speed of a 1.5GHz Xeon MP. "Thirty-two bit support across 64-bit systems is important to Red Hat customers, and we are exploring ways to address this across the various architectures we support," Brian Stevens, vice president of operating system development, said in a statement Friday. Intel's software is a module that becomes part of the kernel, or heart, of Linux, an Intel representative said. Red Hat Linux rival SuSE also will support the technology, and Intel has said Microsoft plans to do so with a Windows version. Intel expects the software to make a debut in the second half of 2003.
2003-02-19 - Red Hat upgrade backs IBM Intel server Leading Linux seller Red Hat quietly released an updated version of its Advanced Server product last week that adds support for IBM's x440 server, an important expansion for both companies. The update to version 2.1 of Red Hat Advanced Server, distributed Thursday and Friday of last week, also was the first in a new plan to release updates once per quarter, company spokeswoman Leigh Day said Tuesday. Red Hat is becoming increasingly aggressive in steering customers and business partners to the premium product instead of its Professional and Personal editions, which can be downloaded for free. IBM has sold Intel servers for years, but its x440 line, which supports as many as 16 Intel Xeon processors, is Big Blue's first in-house design. The product will be expanded later in 2003 to support as many as 32 Xeon processors, while a version with Itanium processors called the x450 is expected in coming weeks. All major server sellers, including longtime holdout Sun Microsystems, now back Linux for its server lines. But IBM is the most aggressive, pushing Linux not only for its Intel-based xSeries line but also for its three other lines that use the company's own processors. Sun, Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer advocate Linux only for their Intel-based servers. Multiple companies, including SGI and NEC, are working to improve Linux for mammoth servers with dozens of processors. Although IBM has high hopes for multiprocessor Xeon systems, Big Blue has been cooling toward Intel's Itanium processor, said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. IBM canceled a plan to release its own AIX version of Unix for Itanium servers and recently transferred a handful of programmers working on Linux for Itanium to work on Linux for IBM's Power server processors. "IBM is starting to cross the line between 'We're not necessarily Itanium's biggest supporter' to 'We're not really convinced Itanium has a role at IBM,'" Haff said. Red Hat sells Advanced Server as a $2,500-per-year subscription that includes access to the Red Hat Network management service, but the new quarterly update cycle reinforces the company's idea that customers are buying not a single software package but rather a constantly adapting product. Red Hat isn't alone. Sun, the dominant seller of Unix servers, releases updates to its Solaris version of Unix quarterly. And Microsoft has been trying, with some resistance, to move customers toward a subscription payment model. Red Hat has said it expects more than 80 percent of its Advanced Server subscribers to sign up for another year. Other Red Hat improvements The new Advanced Server version also supports "Tiger," the Intel kits for building servers with four Itanium 2 processors, Day said. Intel said more than 15 companies--none top-tier server makers--ship Itanium servers using the Tiger parts. In addition, Red Hat said the updated Advanced Server has a better virtual memory system--the part of the operating system that determines what information is stored in memory and what has to be pushed off to be stored on comparatively slow hard drives. Red Hat programmers did the work on the virtual memory system, changes that will benefit users of Oracle's database software in particular, Day said. Virtual memory systems are tricky to design well, said Tim Witham, director of the Open Source Development Lab, a multicompany effort to improve Linux for higher-end servers. And the virtual memory system must adapt as Linux expands to high-end servers running databases, he said. "There are some very different usage models as you move from primarily developers and Web servers into database servers and application servers," Witham said.
2005-04-12 - Red Hat tests dual-core support    Red Hat on Friday began testing support for forthcoming dual-core processors in its first update to its Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or RHEL, software. Dual-core processors combine two processing engines onto a single slice of silicon, a prevailing method of squeezing more performance out of a processor. Red Hat told customers Friday that the beta version of the first update to RHEL 4 includes support for both Advanced Micro Devices' and Intel's dual-core processors. IBM pioneered the market with its Power4 processor in 2001, with Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard following suit with their own chips. AMD and Intel are working to make the technology mainstream with dual-core x86 server processors arriving April 21 and early 2006, respectively. The Red Hat update version also includes an updated IA32 Execution Layer, which lets Intel's Itanium 2 processor run software written for x86 chips such as Xeon. The new update adds support for Intel's forthcoming "Montecito" version of Itanium, reduces memory requirements and boosts performance overall--particularly for Java and mathematical programs, Intel said. The Red Hat update includes the latest support for Intel wireless networking products. Red Hat, the top Linux seller, updates its operating system products quarterly.
2003-03-12 - Red Hat revamps premium Linux plan Linux seller Red Hat on Wednesday will unveil a new phase in its plan to profit from a premium product, introducing a new lower-priced version of its Advanced Server software and a new brand name. The new name for the product is Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS. Red Hat will also introduce an Enterprise Linux ES version for lower-end servers that have one or two processors, said Mark De Visser, vice president of marketing at the Raleigh, N.C.-based company. Red Hat is becoming increasingly aggressive with its high-end Advanced Server software plans, but the company wasn't successful in persuading companies to pay $1,500 to $2,500 per year for a subscription to use the Linux version on low-end servers. The new Enterprise Linux ES product costs $349 or $800 per year, depending on support levels, De Visser said. "We needed to introduce an entry-level version of the enterprise platform," De Visser said. "Advanced Server was just shooting too high." The Enterprise Linux line also includes a WS version for workstations with one or two processors, De Visser said. It costs $179 or $299 per year for basic and standard subscription plans, respectively. The Enterprise Linux products are certified to work with computers from IBM, Dell and Hewlett-Packard and with software from Oracle, Veritas, BMC Software, Borland and others. Red Hat guarantees that software that's certified to work with one version will work on future versions as well, such as the version 3.0 product coming this fall. The company's strategy is an effective way to make money out of Linux and associated higher-level software that can be obtained for free in the open-source realm. Red Hat asserts that, although its premium products can be reconstructed, those versions won't come with certifications. The strategy is proving effective, some believe. "We recently (met) with Red Hat management and came away incrementally more positive on the company's long-term prospects, particularly regarding Red Hat's ability to create competitive barriers for other distributors of Linux, including large companies," Thomas Weisel Partners securities analyst Tim Klasell wrote in a recent report. "We believe that the key differentiation for Red Hat is its relationships with leading (software and hardware companies) and its Advanced Server product." Red Hat will also announce on Wednesday versions of its Enterprise Linux products for Itanium processors. The AS versions cost $1,999 and $2,999 per year, depending on the level of support. That's $500 more per year than the products that run on servers that use Intel's lower-end Xeon and Pentium processors or AMD's Athlon. The WS version costs $800, more than twice the price of the Xeon version. The lower-priced version indicates that Red Hat is adapting to business realities, said Michael Dortch, an analyst with the Robert Frances Group. "Anything a company like Red Hat can do to align pricing more closely to the real life of the target customers is a good thing. It seems to me that this new packaging indicates Red Hat has been listening to customers and responding to what they want," Dortch said. "That's news these days."
2002-12-18 - Red Hat reports slim profit    Red Hat's revenue increased 14 percent to $24.3 million for its third fiscal quarter with a small profit of $305,000, the Linux seller reported Tuesday. The Raleigh, N.C.-based company's performance for the quarter, ended Nov. 30, did slightly better than projections from analysts surveyed by First Call. Revenue was higher than the consensus expectation of $23.4 million, with break-even earnings per share meeting the estimate. It's the first time Red Hat has reported a profit using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), according to the company. In the year-ago quarter, it posted a net loss of 9 cents per share on revenue of $21.2 million. Red Hat sells Linux, a clone of the Unix operating system, and is aiming its flagship Advanced Server product chiefly at business customers who are buying servers. In its most recent quarter, the company introduced two new products: the Advanced Workstation desktop product for technical computer users such as chip designers, and a "carrier grade" operating system for telecommunications companies. Three months ago, Red Hat said it had sold 8,000 copies of Advanced Server since the product went on sale at the end of May. Tuesday, the company said it sold 12,000 in the third quarter. Red Hat treats revenue from Advanced Server as a subscription, collecting money every quarter for a year for the product. About 25 percent to 30 percent of Advanced Server customers are existing Red Hat customers that are upgrading, Chief Executive Matthew Szulik said in an interview. Some analysts are concerned that the Advanced Server product might be expensive for buyers accustomed to Linux's typically low prices. News.com Special Report Vision Series 3 20 minds on tech's future "Our industry inputs indicate that some corporate customers are suffering from sticker shock when faced with the Red Hat Advanced Server product. As a result we believe that Red Hat has had to negotiate on Red Hat Advanced Server pricing with customers, possibly resulting in lower (average selling prices) for the product," said SoundView Technology Group analyst Victor Raisys in a recent note. "We believe that many customers may decide that the significantly lower priced Red Hat 8.0 product is 'good enough' for most needs." Indeed, Red Hat said Tuesday it will split Advanced Server pricing into several categories. Instead of one version, for midrange servers, it will also sell versions for high-end and low-end servers, priced accordingly. "In the future, we will produce a more stratified pricing model," Chief Financial Officer Kevin Thompson said during a conference call. The average selling price of an Advanced Server subscription in the second and third quarters was $800 to $900 over a year, but it will decrease to $600 to $800 in the future, Red Hat said. The lowered price won't diminish revenue, though, because reduced selling prices "will be more than offset by an increase in the size of the market opportunity and expansion of other revenue opportunities," Thompson said. The new approach will mean "a significant increase in the number of servers for which the Red Hat Advanced Server is appropriate from a technology and pricing perspective." The Advanced Workstation version, currently available only for Itanium-based computers from Hewlett-Packard, provides subscription revenue of between $200 and $300 per computer per year right now. The company signed up about 2,000 Advanced Workstation subscribers in the third quarter. A version of Advanced Workstation for the more widely used Intel Pentium and Xeon computers is due in the first quarter of calendar 2003, Thompson said in an interview. Advanced Server for Itanium is in pilot testing now and is expected in the first half of 2003, Szulik said, with interest from customers running large databases with heavy transaction loads. Red Hat reported that it generated $1 million in cash from operations. Its overall gross margins were 66 percent. The company predicted net income of $1.3 million to $2.5 million for the current quarter, which runs through February. Revenue should be between $26.5 million and $27.5 million. Cash generated from operations should increase to between $2 million and $3 million. "We expect to see strong sequential growth in the fourth (fiscal) quarter of 2003," Thompson said. In the third quarter, Red Hat acquired a small company called NOCpulse, disclosing Tuesday that the purchase price was $1.2 million and adding that Red Hat is interested in buying more smaller companies. "The best opportunities are small, talented teams that integrate culturally as well as strategically," Szulik said on a conference call. The company is particularly interested in two areas: managed services that it can offer through its Red Hat Network and security companies, Szulik said. Red Hat said about 70 percent of its revenue comes from direct sales of products to its customers, but over time, it expects 65 percent to 70 percent of sales to come through indirect sales channels such as its partnerships with IBM, Oracle, Dell and Hewlett-Packard. Red Hat announced several customers Tuesday, including General Electric, America Online, the United States Automobile Association, Lithonia and Reuters. In the financial services realm, customers include Credit Suisse First Boston, Lehman Brothers, Citibank, UBS Warburg and J.P. Morgan. Toshiba hired the company for embedded software work, while the French government is paying for Red Hat training services.
2002-01-09 - Red Hat releases Linux for Alpha Itanium   Linux vendor Red Hat has released the latest version of its Linux operating system for two 64-bit platforms: Compaq Computer's Alpha and Intel's Itanium. The move brings version 7.2 of the most popular Linux distribution to a wider range of hardware. It's also a boost for the Itanium--Intel's first entry into high-end server chips--which has maintained a low profile since its launch about a year ago. Itanium does not yet have the same range of available applications as other high-end platforms, such as Sun Microsystems' Solaris or Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX. Linux--with a strong developer community and a flexibility that allows the Unix clone to run on numerous chips--has become an asset the chipmakers want on their sides as they prepare future chip designs. Linux has become a tool to secure quick support for a new chip. Alpha, once considered to be at the leading edge of high-end chip technology, was developed by Digital Equipment, which was later bought by Compaq. Last June, Compaq licensed the chip to Intel and announced it would shift its new server lines to Itanium as a cost-cutting measure. "Compaq's AlphaServer platform is a popular RISC 64-bit platform in the Linux community, and Red Hat is glad to be continuing its longtime collaboration with Compaq with this upcoming release," said Paul Cormier, vice president of engineering at Red Hat, in a statement. Red Hat 7.2 for Itanium takes advantage of the chip's ability to address large amounts of memory, which is crucial to fast database processing. The operating system can run efficiently on systems running eight or more Itanium chips as a single system image, according to Red Hat. The software uses the 2.4.9 Linux kernel and the ext3 file system and includes improved USB support. Software includes an automatic firewall configuration, the Nautilus file manager and the GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) and KDE graphical desktop environments. Ext3 uses journaling for added reliability. The Alpha port will be available this quarter from Compaq, according to Red Hat. The Itanium version is available now from Red Hat and will be available pre-installed on new hardware in "the coming weeks", the company said. Staff writer Matthew Broersma reported from London. News.com's Stephen Shankland contributed to this report.
2001-07-10 - Red Hat releases its Linux for Itanium Linux seller Red Hat has released version 7.1 of its operating system, incorporating advances made possible by Intel's new Itanium chip. Version 7.1 includes a host of improvements to the installation process and included software, the Durham, N.C. company said Monday. The $499 package includes 30 days of support and 6 months of alerts software updates. The software supports as much as 64GB of memory, one of the improvements the 64-bit Itanium made possible compared with earlier 32-bit Intel chips. Red Hat 7.1 is optimized for servers with as many as eight CPUs, Red Hat said.
2000-08-22 - Red Hat cashing in early on Itanium chip   Intel's Itanium chip isn't even for sale yet, but already it's become a revenue generator for Linux company Red Hat. The company today announced services, some of them free and some of them costing a fee, for companies that wish to bring their software or hardware to the Itanium chip. The announcement was made at today's Intel Developer Forum in San Jose, Calif. Itanium, which has been delayed by Intel so that systems won't arrive until next year, is the first in a family of 64-bit chips from the company. It hopes to use Itanium and future 64-bit chips to overpower high-end computer systems from Sun Microsystems, IBM, Compaq Computer and others. Intel believes the three operating systems that will prevail on the new IA-64 chip family are Linux, Windows 64 and IBM's AIX 5L version of Unix, formerly known as the product of Project Monterey. Customers of the Red Hat service, called JumpStart, so far include SteelEye Technology, Avant Technology, Sendmail, Tibco, Rational Software and Unify, Red Hat said. The services include Netfarm, a group of IA-64 computers that developers can use over the Internet; training for installing and configuring Linux on the IA-64 computers; help with translating software to the new architecture; Red Hat certification of hardware or software; and marketing perks such as being included in Red Hat white papers or direct mail advertising. In addition, Red Hat provides free Web support with other fee-based support packages. Red Hat isn't the only Linux company interested in IA-64. VA Linux Systems, for example, in May unveiled a free collection of servers called a CompileFarm that programmers can use over the Internet. Intel chairman Andy Grove said a year ago that his company would support such efforts to provide remote servers, one of a host of ways Intel has changed its usually secretive behavior to accommodate the free-wheeling open-source programming community that creates Linux. TurboLinux was the first to come up with a version of Linux for IA-64 in March. Red Hat followed in May. Since then, competitors SuSE and Caldera Systems also have passed the milestone. Competitors have adopted similar strategies. Intel competitor AMD is luring Linux programmers to a 64-bit chip called Sledgehammer that will compete with Intel's IA-64 family, Meanwhile, Microsoft has been sending copies of its upcoming 64-bit version of Windows to anyone who has an IA-64 machine. Hewlett-Packard, the company that originally came up with the design of the IA-64 chips and that gradually will switch its own high-performance computers to the new architecture, also has been supporting the effort. Company researcher David Mosberger still leads the effort to create an IA-64 Linux kernel, and HP released simulation equipment that enables people lacking IA-64 prototypes to see whether their software works.
2000-08-29 - Recall may hurt Intel but will AMD benefit Intel's pain is not necessarily Advanced Micro Devices' gain. Competition from AMD contributed to Intel's recent production problems, but AMD's limited chipmaking capacity will prevent it from cashing in on the embarrassing mistakes, according to analysts. Meta Group says Intel's recall of its high-end Pentium III processor is a black eye for the company and hands competitor Advanced Micro Devices a PR coup. see commentary  Pressure to outrace AMD led Intel to crank its Pentium III to 1.13 GHz, a speed that was not on its initial road map, analysts said. Unfortunately, the chip's design apparently wasn't ready to go that fast. "Intel has been pushing the clock speed on Pentium III really hard to keep up with AMD," said analyst Linley Gwennap of The Linley Group. "When you push a chip beyond what it was designed to do, you run into problems." Intel would not comment directly on whether the speed race with AMD caused it to stumble. But a spokesman said, "It's a disappointment if (a chip) is introduced and has a quality issue" associated with it. The two chipmakers have been battling to offer the fastest PC processor since AMD debuted its Athlon chip last year. While Intel has stumbled, AMD has turned from a gang that couldn't shoot straight to a formidable competitor. Yesterday the company introduced its 1.1-GHz Athlon and said a number of computer makers including Hewlett-Packard and Gateway were adopting the chip. Industry watchers said AMD has been consistently able to deliver its fastest chips in higher volumes than Intel. Analysts caution, however, that there are limits to how much business AMD can grab. "In the end result, it doesn't make a lot of difference, because AMD has exactly two factories, and Intel has many more," said International Data Corp. analyst Roger Kay. "No matter what AMD does, it can't turn around and supplant Intel. On the other hand, they can get some share with the disgruntled." AMD remains on track to ship 3.6 million Athlon and Duron processors this quarter and still plans to ship 7.2 million of the processors in the fourth quarter, its target before the latest Intel misstep, said company spokesman John Greenagel.  Intel production problems over the past year: August 28Intel says it is recalling its fastest Pentium III, the 1.13-GHz Pentium III, because of potentially faulty circuits. July 2000Intel says the first revenue from its high-end Itanium chip will come later than expected. A week earlier, Intel said most of the initial chips will ship at 733 MHz instead of the planned 800 MHz. May 2000 Intel recalls more than 1 million motherboards using its 820 chipset because of a faulty chip called the "memory translator hub" (MTH). The recall cost the company some $200 million. April 2000Intel says it has underestimated PC demand for the first half of the year and will continue to have problems supplying as many processors as computer makers want. February 2000 Intel discovers a bug that affects some server and workstation computers using Intel 840 and 820 chipsets. Though the glitch is rare, three motherboard designs are canceled in response. September 1999Intel delays the release of its 820 chipset because of problems connecting to Rambus-based memory. Compiled by: Ian Fried and Cecily Barnes "There may be some upside," Greenagel said. AMD is increasing its production rapidly but may not be able to get more Athlon-based computers on shelves than it had initially planned. "While we would have additional capacity, it puts a strain on our infrastructure to supply chipsets and motherboards," he said. Unlike older AMD chips, the Athlon is not compatible with Intel motherboards, meaning computer makers wanting to switch would have to design entirely new systems. Prudential Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann said Intel's latest glitch may give AMD some bragging rights but won't change the bottom line for either company. Even the incremental hit to Intel's image is probably minimal, he argued. "Their brand has been a little tarnished over the past year," Mosesmann said, but he noted that most in the industry knew that the architecture of the Pentium III was on its last legs. Mosesmann said the problems highlight the need for Intel to execute flawlessly on the Pentium 4. "It is important for Intel to be perceived as the leader," he said. ABN Amro analyst David Wu said Intel needs to make sure that it can continue to manufacture the Pentium III in volume because the Pentium 4 will be too expensive for the mainstream market for most of next year. But Wu said Intel should be able to produce Pentium IIIs at up to 1.4 GHz once it shifts to an even thinner 0.13-micron manufacturing process in the middle of next year. The thinner wiring allows the same design to operate at a quicker clock speed. AMD's Greenagel said it is the competition that is revealing Intel's vulnerability. "I'm sure Intel has had problems in the past," Greenagel said. "They've never been visible because they haven't had anyone nipping at their heels."

2003-03-05 - RackSaver AMD heat up the server wars  RackSaver will release servers running Opteron processors from Advanced Micro Devices next quarter, as the two companies heat up the David-and-Goliath battles in the corporate computing market. San Diego, Calif.-based RackSaver, which counts Pixar Animation and Shell Oil as customers, will unveil Opteron-based rack servers April 22, the same day the chip comes out, as well as Opteron-based machines that slide into the company's blade server system, said Gene Kim, vice president of sales and marketing for RackSaver. Although smaller than Dell Computer or IBM, RackSaver is to date the largest manufacturer to commit to the upcoming chip. The decision also highlights the challenges and opportunities for AMD in the corporate market. AMD did not respond to inquiries for comment. On one hand, AMD and RackSaver face an uphill climb in getting notoriously conservative corporate buyers to try, let alone buy, new types of hardware. RackSaver's Opteron computers are based on designs from Newisys. "It is a hard sell to start out with," Kim said. "It is a new processor, and (Newisys is) a new company." On the other, the growing popularity of Linux clusters--conglomerates of one-, two- and four-processor servers tackling tasks that would ordinarily require a supercomputer--has opened the door for smaller manufacturers to carve out niches that behemoths like IBM or Hewlett-Packard can't always adequately squeeze into. Besides displacing Sun Microsystems servers at Pixar, RackSaver has installed large server systems at graphics chip designer Nvidia, energy company Conoco, and Industrial Light and Magic, the effects studio behind the "Star Wars" films. The company also won an award from Intel for selling more Xeon chips than any other tier-two server maker in North America, Kim said, a category that includes pretty much everyone outside the multinational brands. Reader Resources Rack servers CNET White Papers "They've had traction in some of the high-performance computing areas," said David Freund, an analyst at Illuminata. "The key is going to be how these smaller players can act as a boutique firm." The competitive field, though, could become crowded rapidly. Newisys is discussing licensing its Opteron server and motherboard designs to "virtually all" of the major manufacturers, including overseas manufacturers such as NEC and Fujitsu-Siemens, said Jack Steeg, senior vice president of sales and marketing. "It is nip and tuck as to whether they will jump in the pool," Steeg said. Many of these companies are buying seed units from Newisys, he said. Some are also already telling some potential customers that they will provide them Opteron servers based on Newisys designs if needed. "A couple of them are bidding our products," in contract proposals to scientific organizations, Steeg said. Rack and stack As the name suggests, RackSaver specializes in servers that take up less space than wares from competitors. In general, the company concentrates on large contracts, where a private company or a university is seeking to install hundreds, if not thousands, of servers. "We've got customers with 10,000 nodes (individual processors) or more," Kim said. "Since 2001, we have installed more Linux-based clusters in the oil and gas segment than the tier one manufacturers combined." Like its competitors, the company has developed its own set of tools to help information technology executives manage these massive computer collections. The tools can warn of hardware meltdowns, monitor switches and help administrators shift computing burdens. Additionally, RackSaver has designed its own cooling systems, because heat is a special problem in dense blade servers. The design of the company's blade system will also provide a smooth avenue for the acceptance of both AMD's and RackSaver's technologies. The BladeRack system can simultaneously contain six different chips: Intel's Pentium III, Xeon and Itanium, and AMD's Athlon, Opteron and Athlon64. Thus, by buying RackSaver's blade system, customers can experiment with AMD chips and install them, if need be, for regular use. The racks that will accommodate the Opteron chips "are going to be the same as the ones installed at Pixar," Kim said. Large manufacturers, however, may begin to tout how different types of chips can fit into their racks, Freund said. IBM, for instance, is working with Cisco Systems to fit networking equipment into its rack. The Opteron-compatible products coming in April will include a two-processor 1U rack server, a two-processor 2U rack server with hot-swappable drives, and blade racks that can incorporate 44, 66, 88 or 132 processors. Newisys designed the 1U and 2U servers and designed elements of the blades, according to Kim and Steeg. The designations 1U and 2U refer to the dimensions of the server. Additionally, the company will release a small blade that can house eight Itanium processors or 11 Opteron or Xeon processors. The small blade server will be tuned to work with Oracle and IBM databases and pitched at customers in the financial services market.
2004-06-02 - Quadrics adds lower-end supercomputer switch   Quadrics, a company that sells networking gear to link lower-end machines into a cluster that acts like a single high-performance computer, has begun selling its newest technology to smaller customers. The Bristol, U.K.-based company said this week that it has begun selling QsNetII E-Series network adapters and switches geared for eight-computer clusters. Switches for 48- to 128-computer clusters are due later this month, and further switches for 16- and 32-computer clusters are scheduled to arrive in August. Quadrics has found a high-end niche for its technology, which competes with Myricom gear and with networking gear using the InfiniBand and Ethernet industry standards. The QsNetII E-series equipment was used in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Thunder supercomputer, made of 1,024 four-Itanium servers and completing 19.9 trillion calculations per second. The lower-end components are geared for customers such as aeronautical and automotive engineers or universities, Quadrics said. Quadrics supports its network adapters for Linux on Intel's Xeon and Itanium processors and on Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron. While Linux is popular in the high-performance computing cluster market, Microsoft is working to make its Windows operating system competitive in the market.
2002-02-28 - Promoter of storied Alpha to shut doors    API Networks, an important player in the history of the storied Alpha processor, is about to close up shop. The Concord, Mass., company is winding down operations and will go out of business shortly, a victim of slow sales of the Alpha, a chip some thought superior to Intel's famous Pentium but that never caught on with manufacturers. A few remaining API employees also cited as a cause in the demise Compaq Computer's June 2001 decision to license the Alpha to Intel and adopt Intel Itanium chips for servers. Although Compaq has committed to coming out with future versions of the Alpha, most Alpha engineers have already left Compaq to work on Itanium at Intel. API Networks notified employees of the pending shutdown at the end of December, according to a statement provided to CNET News.com. At that time, API laid off much of its staff of about 100 employees. Layoffs continued in patches until now; about five employees are left with the job of settling accounts with suppliers and clearing out remaining inventory. API Networks was a small, but historically significant, company in the universe of computers. The company was created by Compaq and Samsung in 1998 as Alpha Processor Inc. to help promote the Alpha chip, a 64-bit processor for servers originally developed by Digital Equipment, and to provide technological assistance to expand the chip's capabilities. Though its technological contributions were considered excellent, the company landed few customers, said Terry Shannon, publisher of the newsletter Shannon Knows Compaq. "It's unfortunate," Shannon said. "But given what happened to Alpha, I'm not surprised." Throughout its history, API promoted Alpha mainly through engineering. The company developed and marketed a series of Alpha motherboards aimed at decreasing the cost of workstations and servers based on Alpha. It also sold its own Alpha-based computers. API also established a relationship with Advanced Micro Devices. After the 1999 launch of AMD's Athlon, which uses the Alpha 21264 bus, API began work on an ambitious plan dubbed "Slot B." Though the plan revolved around building multiprocessor Athlon computers, APIs strategy was to create a motherboard that was compatible with both the Athlon and the Alpha. At the time, Athlon chips were packaged in cartridge-like cases and fit into a connector on the motherboard called "Slot A." The Slot B approach would have been able to take advantage of the higher sales volumes of the Athlon chip and its standard motherboards to decrease the price of boards for Alpha, lowering system costs. But the plan never came to fruition. Not long afterward, AMD moved the Athlon to a new socket method of attaching the chip to its motherboards. Despite its performance, which was considered by almost everyone to be superior to the Pentium, Alpha continued to flounder under Compaq. Then, in 1999, Microsoft dealt Alpha a serious blow by discontinuing support for the chip on its Windows NT operating system. API quickly changed its game plan in 2000. It refocused on Linux, establishing a new division called API Networks to sell Alpha-based Linux servers. Soon, in November 2000, it changed the name of the entire company to API Networks. But the efforts were not enough, even though API joined AMD in other promising projects, including a chip-to-chip networking protocol now known as HyperTransport. The protocol will become API's legacy, Shannon said. AMD plans to use HyperTransport in new chipsets for Hammer chips. "What's good is that HyperTransport will live on," Shannon said. HyperTransport will, indeed, live on; many of API's former employees, including about 35 engineers, administrators and executives, have gone to work for AMD. AMD will open the doors on a new Boston Design Center next Monday. The center, located in Boxborough, Mass., will develop HyperTransport interconnects for servers for AMD's Computation Products Group. Gerry Talbot, former president and chief technical officer of API Networks, was named director of the design center.

2001-06-12 - PC sales flu infects servers   Will price war spark PC demand?Stephen Baker, analyst, NPD Intelect The server market followed PCs into the high-tech slump in the first quarter of 2001, with worldwide sales of $13.3 billion representing a 4 percent drop from a year ago, research firm IDC will report Wednesday. The companies that fared best were top-ranked IBM, whose revenue grew 13 percent to $3.3 billion, and fifth-place Dell Computer, which grew 21 percent to $884 million, according to figures compiled by IDC. Many companies got hammered in the slide but managed to squeeze out market-share gains: Revenue for third-place Sun Microsystems slipped 3 percent to $2.05 billion, and fourth-place Compaq Computer dropped 2 percent to $1.96 billion. But while Hewlett-Packard maintained its second-place ranking, its 5 percent revenue drop to $2.12 billion meant it did even worse than the market as a whole. Spending cutbacks by both home users and businesses have swept across the computer industry, causing an unprecedented decline in PC sales, inventory gluts and price wars. Servers are the powerful, networked computers that handle everything from dishing up Web pages and processing stock sales to logging phone calls and approving loans. The machines are generally more profitable than PCs--especially because selling a server can spur related spending on services and other products--but the sector has had its ups and downs before. One bad quarter in recent memory came at the end of 1999, when IDC showed server sales dropping 6 percent from the previous year, to $14 billion. But this time, most computer makers can't rely on PC sales or other revenue sources to compensate, and the withering dot-com revolution has undermined hopes that the Internet would spur huge server growth. The economic climate remains sour, according to a recent survey of technology executives by Deutsche Banc Alex Brown. "No one we spoke with is currently planning a second-half pickup in spending at this time," analyst Christopher Mortenson said of the survey, which polled 260 chief information officers late last month. "The worst is probably not over yet," and spending in the second quarter of 2002 probably will be "as weak or weaker" than in the first quarter, Mortenson said. Regionally, the United States fared worst, with server sales dropping 16 percent to $4.4 billion in the first quarter, IDC said. Japan slipped 12 percent to 2.1 billion, and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region increased 12 percent to $1.2 billion. Western European sales increased 16 percent to $3.8 billion. A contrite HP HP was one of the companies hit hardest, acknowledging that its own problems compounded the spending slowdown. "We did not do well last quarter, either the top-line (revenue) numbers or bottom-line" profits, said Duane Zitzner, president of HP's computing division, vowing to improve results at a gloomy analyst meeting last week. In that meeting, HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina said the economic malaise that began in the United States and spread to Europe was hitting Asia as well. HP is banking on two major elements for its server future: the long-awaited release of Intel's Itanium chip that HP helped develop and HP's top-end Superdome server. Superdome can accommodate as many as 64 of HP's specialized PA-RISC chips today but will be able to use second-generation Itanium chips in 2002. Itanium, a radical departure from Intel's earlier chip, is still chiefly useful for testing the new design, Zitzner and others agree. But Superdome is catching on, he said, with sales to Amazon.com, American Airlines, AT&T Broadband, BMW, Cisco Systems, Debis IT Services, General Mills, Johnson & Johnson, Liz Claiborne, Mobilkom Austria, Nestle, Nextel, SAP, the U.S. Navy and Verizon. But Superdome got off to a slower-than-expected start, HP has acknowledged. IDC's statistics reflect that view: In the first quarter of 2001, when the product went on sale, high-end server revenue at HP dropped 24 percent to $149 million. A key battle: Unix servers One of the hottest areas of battle is the market for Unix servers, comparatively expensive machines that experienced a renaissance when they proved adept at handling Internet chores and Microsoft had trouble making Windows servers sufficiently crash-proof. Sun rose to the top of the Unix server market while IBM, HP and Compaq suffered from more complicated product lines. Now Sun is under attack. Meta Group expects the excess capacity and secondary market glut to have been "digested" and the demand for nondiscretionary infrastructure enhancements to rise by the end of 2001. see commentary In the first quarter of 2001, Sun kept its top-ranked 32 percent share of the Unix server market, with sales of $2 billion. Third-place IBM, though, narrowed that lead by gaining 5 points to 21 percent market share, with sales of $1.4 billion. Second-place HP slipped a point to 25 percent share on sales of $1.6 billion. Sun, which introduced a new product line as the market was souring, acknowledges the rough environment but argues that it's in a good position to win market share. "I'd much rather play our hand than anybody else's right now," said Shahin Khan, head of marketing for Sun's server group. Down markets cripple weaker companies while strengthening the others, he said. "The downturn happened exactly as we were going through a transition. When the uptick comes, I think we'll be poised very well." Sun is aggressively discounting prices, introducing its newest line at half the price of comparable IBM products, Khan said. The Unix server market overall slipped 2 percent to $6.5 billion in sales for the first quarter. Meanwhile, the Windows server market grew 7 percent to about $3.2 billion, IDC said. Dell and Compaq, the top two Windows server sellers, are locked in a price war to keep market share.
2004-02-10 - Patriot Intel in patent squabble   Patriot Scientific, an eight-employee semiconductor designer, has filed lawsuits alleging that five computer makers infringed its patents by selling Pentium-based computers, a move that has drawn a suit in response from Intel. The struggling San Diego-based company, which reported revenue of $52,000 and a net loss of $873,000 in the quarter that ended Nov. 30, has filed lawsuits against Japanese PC manufacturers Sony, Matsushita, Fujitsu, Toshiba and NEC, alleging they infringed Patriot's patents by selling computers containing Pentium chips that run at 120MHz or higher. Chips running at this speed have been around since late 1995 and are in the bulk of desktop, notebooks and servers operating today. More suits against other PC makers may follow, Patriot has indicated. Theoretically, the lawsuits could lead to millions of dollars in damages. Patriot has said that its intellectual property has been incorporated into $150 billion worth of semiconductors. It is difficult to evaluate the validity of Patriot's claims, said Richard Belgard, a patent consultant, but if the company can show validity, it should be fairly straightforward to establish whether infringement occurred. Intel is fighting Patriot's claims. Last week, the chipmaking giant filed an action for declaratory relief in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Its suit seeks a ruling that Intel's intellectual property does not infringe Patriot's patents. "After reviewing the suits against our customers, it became clear to us that Patriot was really claiming our microprocessors infringed," said Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman. Patriot, which has not sued Intel, has said it will vigorously defend itself in the declaratory relief action and file a counterclaim. Patriot has not identified other potential defendants but has said that several electronics manufacturers are benefiting from its technology. The selection of Japanese defendants for the first round of suits may have been deliberate, noted one source, because Japanese companies have historically shown a tendency to settle early. Patriot has not commented on this matter. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. The claims primarily revolve around a patent titled "High Performance Microprocessor Having Variable Speed System Clock," no. 5,809,336 in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In microprocessors, time is kept by a vibrating crystal. In the early days of the business, processors operated at the same pace of the vibrating crystal. Microprocessors, however, started to move much faster than the crystal, requiring an internal mechanism to keep the two synchronized, said Jim Turley, an independent chip analyst and a member of Patriot's scientific advisory board. Around six months ago, Patriot's executives determined that they had a claim against PC makers using Pentium chips, Turley said. He did not comment on the merits of the suit but said "it looks like (the original inventors) were onto something clever." The patent application was filed in June 1995, and itself grew out of a patent application from August 1989. The U.S. patent office granted the patent in September 1998. Patriot has seen better days. Founded in 1987, the company specialized in embedded processors for communications and medical equipment. At its peak, the company had 32 employees, said CEO Jeff Walin, who joined the company in 2002. "The company is being funded on a dead equity basis," said Walin, explaining that Patriot is surviving by selling debentures. The publicity surrounding the suit has caused Patriot's stock to rise from 7 cents to 12 cents. Intel paid Intergraph hundreds of millions to settle two lawsuits that alleged Intel's Itanium and Pentium chips violated Intergraph's patents. The Intergraph settlements, however, ended after lengthy court proceedings and discovery.
2003-01-13 - Patents a virtue for IBM   IBM will announce on Monday that it was the top recipient of U.S. patents in 2002. Big Blue was awarded 3,288 patents during the past year, making it the top recipient among private sector companies for the 10th year in a row, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Canon ranked second during in 2002 with 1,893 patents. IBM has generated just over 22,000 patents during the last 10 years, but those patents have changed with the times, IBM researchers said. Many of the company's newest patents are related to servers; grid computing; and self-healing, or autonomic, computers and how to better put them to use for customers. Most of the new patents also fit into the framework of IBM's computing on demand initiative, announced late last year, said Ravi Arimilli, an IBM research fellow. "The patent process has a lot to do with what customers are thinking about or where IBM wants to go into the market," Arimilli said. "The new technologies we're pursuing are for where we see growth in the (information technology) industry." The computing on demand initiative seeks to provide self-organizing, self-healing computer networks that IBM or its customers can use to provide computing power like a utility. Many of the patents cover related technology. Arimilli himself had 78 patents awarded during 2002. The technologies his patents cover went into IBM's Power4 processor for servers--as well as into its eventual successor, the Power5--and into the p690 server, which is built around the Power4. "I'm kind of like the thread that crosses all these different technologies and then produces an architecture that IBM goes to market with," Arimilli said, of working with various teams inside the company to develop new products. Arimilli is part of a small army of employees IBM calls "inventors," who contribute patents. Big Blue, which spent $5.5 billion on research in 2001, has a cadre of about 3,000 researchers, though about 5,000 people across the company contributed to its 2002 patent total. This year's patents came from several areas around the company. Although a large chunk--600--came straight from IBM Research, about 1,200 patents were awarded for work done by IBM's Technology Group, which includes the company's Microelectronics Division. Microelectronics is responsible for processors like the PowerPC. IBM's server group, which stewards the Power4, contributed nearly 600 patents to the total. IBM's software group had 470 patents in 2002. Meanwhile, Canon, with 7,300 researchers and engineers, spent 218,616,000 yen, or about $1.66 million, on research and development, according to its 2001 annual report. IBM's nearest competitors, NEC, Hitachi and Hewlett-Packard, were ranked fourth, fifth and ninth, respectively. One reason IBM is so prolific, aside from its large budget, lies in its philosophy, Arimilli said. "We have a lot of young engineers at IBM. We give them big responsibilities," he said. "When we did Power4, (Intel engineers) were doing Merced (Intel's Itanium chip). We probably had one quarter of the people working on the microprocessor as they did. "We said (to the young engineers), 'You've got to break these barriers. You've got to be better than these guys.' The mode is almost the underdog approach of trying to be better, and you'd be amazed with the results. They seem to respond to the challenge...It's really neat watching this happen."
2006-03-07 - Partnership set to run RISC software on Intel chips    Intel has begun a partnership to help a start-up, Transitive, with software that enables computers with Intel chips to run programs written for rival processors. Transitive's translation software will be used to let software from rival RISC (reduced instruction set computing) processors run on Intel's Itanium and Xeon server processors. The partnership is designed to make it easier for customers to scrap competitors' gear in favor of Intel-based systems. "With this relationship with Intel, Intel is funding development and providing us access to engineers so we can accelerate the development of processor-operating system combinations," Transitive Chief Executive Bob Wiederhold said in an interview. Intel also will help with promotion and cooperation with software companies, he said, adding that customers will get the software from computer makers. Intel is Transitive's third major publicly announced customer. The first was Silicon Graphics, whose customers can run software for their older MIPS-based computers on newer Itanium models. The second was Apple Computer, whose Transitive-based Rosetta product lets software for older PowerPC-based models run on new Intel Core-based machines. Transitive announced the partnership at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco and said the first elements of the software would hit the market in 2006. However, the companies didn't say which of the likely RISC candidates--Sun's Sparc, Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC, HP's Alpha, IBM's Power or SGI's MIPS--would be supported or targeted first. Letting a computer run software written for another type has sometimes helped during technology transitions, such as Apple's switch from 68000-series Motorola processors to PowerPC models. But generally, the lackluster performance has kept its use to a narrow niche. Intel, though, is bullish about Transitive. "Customers can expect to see outstanding performance of their RISC-based binaries on Intel Itanium-based systems coupled with Transitive's QuickTransit dynamic binary translation products," said Kirk Skaugen, vice president of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group.
2012-11-19 - Otellini's legacy at Intel Plentiful profits mobile misfires   When Intel CEO Paul Otellini retires in May, he'll leave a mixed record. On the one hand, Intel's processor manufacturing prowess remains second to none, with the company often introducing new miniaturization technology years ahead of rivals. As ever more companies withdraw from chip manufacturing, Intel manages to keep turning the crank profitably. During Otellini's reign, Intel has so far generated $107 billion in cash from operations and paid dividends of $23.5 billion. The Razr i sports an Intel Atom chip. Motorola Mobility But Intel also has failed to come to terms with a powerful force in the processor world -- the rise of mobile devices using low-power ARM processors. These are the chips that power every iPhone and iPad, almost every Android device, and the new Microsoft Surface tablet. It's an embarrassing absence for Intel. The company has gained a tiny foothold with its Medfield generation of processors, which are used for example in Motorola Razr i phone and some other products. But mostly, Intel is conspicuous in this market by its absence from a market that is both large and fast-growing. Under Otellini, an Intel insider who became CEO in May 2005, the company has faced many chip challenges. In the days when he was coming aboard, Advanced Micro Devices was strongly competitive, having made the jump to 64-bit x86 processors as Intel was still bogged down with its ill-fated and incompatible Itanium family. Intel recovered its poise and now is the driving force in the x86 server market. Intel also wrestled with the power wall -- the unpleasant reality that new processors couldn't run at faster clock rates without devastatingly high levels of power consumption and waste heat. The answer has been a push toward multicore processors, spreading computing out over multiple processing engines working in parallel. ARM'd incursions But the mobile challenge has been intractable for Intel, and though the company's fortunes may improve in coming months, it's a certainty that the company will only be a challenger at best in the mobile market. ARM processors are just too pervasive. For many years, Intel benefited from the fact that it's hard to move software from one processor architecture to another. That's in part what made Itanium such a hard sell, why AMD could ride on Intel's coattails with x86 chips, and why Microsoft Surface is such a departure from ordinary Windows devices running on x86 machines. Software compatibility is only useful if you're on top, though. Now with mobile devices, ARM has the advantage. iOS software is written to run natively on the ARM chips in Apple's devices. And although Android apps use a higher-level abstraction layer called Dalvik that insulates many programs from the particulars of a chip instruction set, a good many programs also use Google's Native Developer Kit (NDK) so programs speak directly to ARM processors. That's especially true when programmers want the highest performance. And ARM is rising. Now Samsung and Google have releasd an ARM-based Chromebook, and rumors persist that Apple could release ARM-based Macs. ARM licenses its processor designs to others that combine them with modules for things like graphics, input-output, and video decoding into processor designs called system-on-a-chip, or SOC. The company got its start in 1990 as Advanced RISC Machines, a spinoff from Acorn Computer Group that combined with Apple's effort to obtain a processor for its Newton handheld computer. After years in the shadows, ARM processors are now hot. Now the ARM action is elsewhere. Qualcomm, Nvidia, Samsung, Apple, and many others design chips with processing engines. Even AMD, no longer manufacturing chips of its own, has caught ARM religion. ARM, in a way, is doing to Intel what Intel did to higher-end competitors in the processor market. If lower-cost chips can get the job done, they can relegate higher-end competition to expensive machines that ship only in low volume. And for a chipmaker, manufacturing volume is crucial to profitability. Note, too, that ARM chips are making the jump to 64-bit chips, and the new ARM Cortex A15 models are designed for computers that need more horsepower. The irony here is that Intel once had a competitive ARM design. It was called StrongARM, later XScale, and it picked up the asset from legendary computer designer Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC) when Compaq acquired it in 1998. StrongARM was clearly on the periphery of Intel's business priorities, but it wasn't irrelevant. As an exercise in pondering what might have been, remember that Intel showed off a StrongARM-based tablet in 2001. Intel can be forgiven for not investing in StrongARM and XScale, a division it sold off in 2006. The Itanium lesson in the perils of incompatible chip designs was expensive. But it's not so easy to forgive Intel for not building a competitive x86 processor for mobile devices. The Atom designs are a start, and they have a place in Windows tablets and lower-end computers. But Otellini's successor will have to make them into something much greater.
2011-08-19 - Oracle's choice to nix Itanium support hurts HP sales  Hewlett-Packard and Oracle are at odds over Itanium support and the former appears to be taking the body blows. In June, HP filed a civil lawsuit in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara to force Oracle to support the Itanium platform. In March, Oracle had said it would stop supporting HP's Itanium platform because Intel planned to shut it down in the long run. HP and Intel both denied Oracle's claims. The two parties last month exchanged courtroom jabs over Itanium support. Now it appears that Oracle's Itanium decisions are impacting sales of HP's mission-critical systems. From a buyer perspective, putting off a purchase makes sense. Why would an Oracle shop buy an Itanium based-system if support was uncertain going forward? Yesterday, HP CEO Leo Apotheker--amid a massive corporate revamp--acknowledged that the Itanium flap was hurting business. Apotheker said: Revenue in business critical systems declined 9 percent year over year. This decline is sharper than expected as our ability to close deals has been impacted by Oracle's decision and orders are being delayed or canceled. We are working diligently to enforce the commitments that Oracle has made to our customers and to HP. Apotheker referenced Oracle a few times in regards to Itanium. He also said that HP was taking Oracle to court over "anti-customer behavior." It's unclear where this Itanium spat goes ultimately, but for now the flap is freezing sales of Itanium-based systems. Hewlett-Packard This story was originally published at ZDNet's Between the Lines.
2006-03-02 - Oracle to expand Itanium support   PALO ALTO, Calif.--Oracle will expand its support for Hewlett-Packard's Itanium-based Unix servers, bringing a version of its E-Business Suite to market by the end of the year, the software giant said Thursday. Oracle's core database software has been available for years with HP's Integrity line of Itanium servers, but the E-Business Suite for finances and other corporate operations has been missing. But HP and Intel, which jointly designed the Itanium chip, have been working to expand the number of software partners in an attempt to fix a major problem that hampered the chip's debut. To emphasize the significance of the expanded partnership, HP and Intel sent their top executives to an Itanium-focused meeting Thursday with mutual customers at HP headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif. Mark Hurd and Paul Otellini, the respective chief executives at HP and Intel, announced the partnership at the meeting, while Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison made a video appearance. "We're trying to put more energy into our relationship," Hurd said. "If you're a customer, the key message I want you to hear is you can sleep well tonight, knowing you've got tremendous energy, power and investment behind this." Video: Otellini says Itanium on track Intel CEO hypes new dual-core chipset IBM and Sun Microsystems continue to take on Itanium strongly, but Hurd and Otellini said they'll be taking the offensive with the chip. "We're going to go get aggressive in the marketplace. We put a lot into this, and we've got a lot more coming," Hurd said. Itanium allies have pledged to spend $10 billion advancing the Itanium technology and market in the next five years, and $1 billion a year of that is from HP, he said. And Otellini said HP Integrity servers using the next-generation "Montecito" Itanium chips will be the turning point. "The Integrity machine based on Montecito is really the machine we've been waiting for, the machine our collective sales forces can get behind," Otellini said. "I think you'll see customer adoption rates much faster than you'd expect." Video: Hurd's commitment to Integrity During a live Webcast of executives from Intel and Oracle, HP CEO Mark Hurd discusses his company's $1 billion annual commitment to Integrity servers. Ellison, too, offered superlatives in his video appearance. "There is no more important platform for Oracle than HP and Itanium," he said. A key part of the Oracle move is to release software not just for powerful back-end systems, but also to midrange servers, Judson Althoff, vice president of platform and distribution alliances at Oracle, said in an interview. HP welcomed the move. "Our customers at HP-Oracle shops have been saying, 'We want the complete portfolio.' We had bits and pieces, but we didn't have the entire thing," Rich Marcello, head of the Integrity products, said in an interview before the event. HP didn't want to wait for Oracle's Project Fusion, which merges components from Oracle's software with products from major companies it has acquired, including PeopleSoft and J.D. Edwards. One such customer is Scott Womer, the manager of systems engineering at Atmos Energy. He just installed the Oracle E-business Suite on HP Linux systems using Intel Xeon processors. He would have preferred Itanium models, he said, but the systems had to be running in March. "We just failed to get our E-Business Suite on Itanium because of the timing issue," he said. "The presentation today makes me feel a lot better about that." For the computing industry, Itanium has been a cautionary tale. The chip once was expected to dominate the computing industry, but that grand vision fell victim to product delays, poor performance and software incompatibilities with mainstream x86 chips such as Intel's Pentium. Itanium is central to HP's effort to remain powerful in the high-end server market and for Intel's effort to penetrate it. The two companies are leading a multiple-company alliance that has pledged to spend $10 billion on Itanium product development, marketing and software company recruitment through the end of the decade. Many companies are in the alliance, but HP is the only representative of the top four server makers. IBM, HP, Dell and Sun collectively accounted for 80 percent of the $51.7 billion in server sales in 2005, according to Gartner, but only HP sells Itanium models. It's not all bad news for Itanium, though. The chip runs not just HP's version of Unix, called HP-UX, but also Windows, Linux and two relatively rare HP operating systems, OpenVMS and NonStop Kernel. And second-tier server companies, including Unisys, Silicon Graphics Inc., Hitachi, NEC, Groupe Bull and Fujitsu, design and sell their own Itanium models. The Itanium server market is expected to grow to $6.6 billion in 2009, according to IDC--a significant number though one vastly smaller than earlier, more-bullish forecasts. There are currently 7,100 applications available for Itanium, Marcello said. "We're getting close to being done. We've identified that when we get around 9,000, we've done all the homework," Marcello said. Also at Thursday's event, HP drew attention to favorable pricing moves by Oracle. In December, Oracle lowered software prices for multicore chips--those that employ multiple processing engines on the same slice of silicon. Oracle no longer charges twice as much for dual-core Intel processors, including Montecito, the first dual-core Itanium model, which was delayed but is due later this year. Oracle prices software based on how many processors a server has. In the past, Oracle counted a processor core as a full processor. But now for multicore Intel and AMD chips, the license fee is half the full-processor amount per core. By contrast, the license fee for IBM's dual-core Power models is three-quarters the full-processor fee for each core. "We are partnering with Oracle to take on IBM and DB2," IBM's database software, Marcello said. Oracle is making another new pricing move. HP servers can be carved up into multiple partitions, and now Oracle will charge based on the number of processors in a partition running its software, Marcello said. Previously, Oracle counted all the processors even if many were devoted to other tasks.
2001-12-04 - Oracle throws weight behind Itanium    Oracle on Monday released a version of its database management software designed for Intel's Itanium processor--a move crucial to the chip's success, according to hardware executives and analysts. Itanium-based servers won't take off commercially until databases and other applications come out that work with them, driving demand for the chip, according to many industry watchers. The lack of customer interest so far in the chip is at least in part due to the lack of Itanium-ready applications. Database software, in particular, is vital to businesses and Web sites because it stores, manages and retrieves vast amounts of data, forming the foundation on which other applications run. Oracle is the database market leader. Oracle announced support for Itanium on its 9i database software as part of its Oracle OpenWorld conference in San Francisco. The company is using this week's conference to announce new versions of its database and application-server software--technology that runs e-commerce or Web site transactions. The developer version of Oracle's 9i database, available as a free download on Oracle's developer Web site, supports Linux 64, HP-UX and Windows XP operating systems. Dell Computer, Compaq Computer and Hewlett-Packard are among the hardware makers supporting Oracle's database software designed for Itanium. Separately, Linux seller MandrakeSoft released its version of Linux 64 for Itanium on Monday. "The issue that we face in general is the software support," Tom Bradicich, director of architecture and technology for IBM's Intel server group, said in a recent interview. "That will be the key to the adoption rate." The developer version of Oracle 9i allows software programmers to start testing and developing with the new version of the database. If they decide to use it for their business needs in the future, however, they will have to pay Oracle for its use, Oracle executives said. Intel is currently selling the "Merced" version of Itanium, which has primarily been used in test systems so far. A new, higher-performance version of the chip, called "McKinley," will start to appear in test systems soon and in commercially available systems by the middle of 2002. During a keynote speech at OpenWorld on Monday afternoon, Intel Chief Executive Craig Barrett trumpeted the partnership between Oracle and Intel. The Internet is helping drive communications, commerce, information access and entertainment--and Intel and Oracle play a big role in the Net's infrastructure, he said. "This requires more and more processing power and more and more reliable data storage," he said. During Barrett's speech, Oracle executives demonstrated forthcoming unified messaging features built into the Oracle 9i application server. Unified messaging offers the ability to check voice mail, e-mail and faxes from a PC, phone, or other device. For example, people can have e-mail read to them over the phone. Barrett said the two companies collaborated on the new technology. In related news, Oracle announced that nine customers have begun using its "clustering software" built into the 9i database. Clustering lets businesses harness multiple servers to run a very large database, allowing servers to share work or take over from one another if one fails. Oracle executives have claimed the clustering software would make the company's database perform faster and more reliably than rival clustering technology by IBM and Microsoft. And because companies using Oracle's clustering technology can use multiple servers rather than one large server, they can also save money, Oracle executives said. Customers using Oracle's clustering technology, called Real Application Clusters, include American Airlines, Gas Authority of India, South African Police Service, security company VeriSign and Vector SCM, which is building a business-to-business Web site for carmaker General Motors. Sun Microsystems and Dell also announced support for Oracle's clustering technology in its servers. Dell, for instance, will make the clustering software available on its PowerEdge 6400 server in January. Dell's product will support Windows and Linux operating systems. Sun's Fire 280R Server system with Sun StorEdge T3 Arrays will be available this month and support Sun's Solaris operating system. Oracle executives on Monday also demonstrated new software that allows companies to manage all their files housed in a cluster of databases. The new software called a file system, previously available on Compaq's Tru64 operating system, will soon be available for the Windows and Linux operating systems, said Bob Shimp, vice president of Oracle database marketing.

2011-11-20 - Oracle Reports of Itanium's life greatly exaggerated   A wafer of Itanium 9300 processors. Intel Oracle filed court papers this week alleging that a "secret" deal between Itanium developers HP and Intel is the only reason for the continued existence of the long-troubled chip--for which the business-software giant is ending its support. "HP has secretly contracted with Intel to keep churning out Itaniums so that HP can maintain the appearance that a dead microprocessor is still alive," reads the filing, which All Things Digital's Arik Hesseldahl describes as a routine affair about the discovery process and timing in HP's lawsuit against Oracle for dropping the chip. HP alleges that Oracle's motivation for ending Itanium support is the latter company's acquisition of Sun Microsystems and its server business, which relies on Intel x86 chips. Oracle, HP claims, is simply trying to convince Itanium customers that the chip isn't long for this world and to get them to switch to x86-based servers like Sun's. Related stories Hewlett-Packard sues Oracle over Itanium support Oracle declares Intel's Itanium dead Oracle's choice to nix Itanium support hurts HP sales Oracle to expand Itanium support Itanium: A cautionary tale Oracle, on the other hand, says HP's desire to keep customers on Itanium is based on the fact that the Itanium-reliant HP UX operating system commands more in service fees than would a system based on x86 chips. This "led HP to craft a top-secret plan to create a false perception that Itanium still had a future," Hesseldahl quotes the Oracle filing as saying. "HP understands that the future prospects of IT products drive customer purchasing decisions. A buyer who knew that Intel saw no future for Itanium, and was only continuing to invest in the line pursuant to a contractual obligation, would devalue the future prospects of Itanium servers and be less inclined to buy." In a statement to Hesseldahl, HP fires back. "This filing is just the latest in [Oracle's] ongoing campaign to shore up its failing Sun server business and starve thousands of existing Itanium customers who rely on their Itanium processors for mission-critical activities. "As Oracle well knows, HP and Intel have a contractual commitment to continue to sell mission-critical Itanium processers to our customers through the next two generations of microprocessors, thus ensuring the availability of Itanium through at least the end of the decade. HP is resolved to enforcing Oracle's commitments to HP and our shared customers and will continue to take actions to protect its customers' best interests." HP filed its lawsuit in June of this year. And in August, then-CEO Leo Apotheker acknowledged that the Itanium flap was hurting business, saying, "Revenue in business-critical systems declined 9 percent year over year. This decline is sharper than expected as our ability to close deals has been impacted by Oracle's decision and orders are being delayed or canceled. We are working diligently to enforce the commitments that Oracle has made to our customers and to HP." The Itanium chip was introduced in 1996 and has long been the butt of industry jokes owing to its failure to live up to its developers' hopes--instead of becoming the server market's "unifying architecture," spanning many server lines and operating systems, it's been relegated to a high-end niche. Intel had no comment for Hesseldahl, but the company has said before that it stands behind Itanium. When Oracle announced, in March, that it was dropping support for the chip, Intel CEO Paul Otellini said, "We remain firmly committed to delivering a competitive, multi-generational roadmap for HP-UX and other operating system customers that run the Itanium architecture."
1999-11-12 - Oracle commits to Monterey OS  Oracle announced its support of the upcoming Monterey operating system, a joint program by IBM and Santa Cruz Operation to create a version of Unix for Intel's upcoming 64-bit processors. While analysts expected Oracle ultimately to support Monterey, the database software maker hadn't committed until today. "People have been waiting for Oracle to endorse, support, or do anything with Monterey," said a Santa Cruz Operation spokesperson, noting that negotiations can take a long time. "We're certainly very happy about it." Monterey is a project to combine three versions of Unix--IBM's AIX, Sequent's Dynix/ptx, and SCO's UnixWare--into a single version that will run both on IBM's Power chips and on Intel's 64-bit chips. Intel is scheduled to release the first of those "IA-64" chips, called Itanium and formerly code-named Merced, in mid-2000 with computers using it later that year. "We're interested in consolidating Unix so our customers and [software companies] can spend their time working on their software instead of porting to different flavors of Unix," said Oracle's Mike Rocha in a news conference today. Signing up major software companies is critical to establishing the success of a new operating system and a new chip architecture, and database companies in particular are a necessary ingredient given Intel's e-commerce push for these new chips. Other software companies committed to Monterey include Netscape Communications, PeopleSoft, Baan, Tivoli, BEA Systems, Marcam Solutions, Informix, Computer Associates, and BMC. Other versions of Unix for the IA-64 will include Sun Microsystems' Solaris and Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX. In addition, Linux, a close relative of Unix, will be available. Other computer makers are taking different approaches. SGI chose to adopt Linux instead of porting its Irix version of Unix, and Compaq Computer reversed its commitment to provide its Tru64 Unix on IA-64. Monterey-64 is up and running on Itanium prototypes. Oracle will contribute some of its own software to Monterey and AIX. It will help add its Oracle Internet Directory, software that makes it easier for companies with large numbers of computers to find network resources such as printers and keep track of details such as the Internet addresses of different servers. Oracle announced earlier this year Oracle Internet Directory, which will be integrated into Oracle 8i and be an alternative to Microsoft's Active Directory technology. Oracle Internet Directory will be part of the company's Oracle 8i database, a move that analysts say further strengthens the company's goal of providing an all-in-one Internet deployment platform and an alternative to Microsoft's Windows NT and other server-based software. The company will integrate it with the Novell Directory Services (NDS), a popular directory technology, to make sure they can work together. The Oracle Internet Directory joins other new features the company is including in the database, such as built-in development tools and an internal file system for storing and managing Web pages as well as Windows application files. Oracle 8i also will be available on several other versions of Unix, including Solaris, HP-UX, Tru64 Unix, and Linux, but the company hopes for some consolidation in the Unix area, Rocha said.News.com's Mike Ricciuti contributed to this report.
2006-06-28 - Opteron climbs supercomputer rankings  Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron chip soared up the latest ranking of the top 500 supercomputers in the world, while Intel's Itanium continued to fall and IBM took top honors among vendors. The latest list was expected to be unveiled at the International Supercomputing Conference in Germany on Wednesday. The Top 500 project measures the world's fastest supercomputers according to the Linpack benchmark, which focuses on solving linear equations. Servers based on x86 processors from Intel and AMD have been taking over the list in recent years. Intel's processors can be found in 301 of the Top 500 systems, with its 64-bit Xeon processors accounting for 118 of those systems. However, that's down from 333 in November, the last time the list was released. AMD's Opteron processors now can be found in 81 of the servers, up dramatically from 25 systems last year and 55 systems in November. Intel's Itanium processor continued its descent down the list, now accounting for just 37 systems compared with 46 in November and 79 a year ago. IBM had the most systems on the list, with 243, led by the most powerful supercomputer in the world, the Blue Gene/L system at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California. IBM also had the top three systems on the list--with the Blue Gene Watson system in the company's own labs coming in second and Lawrence Livermore's ASC Purple in third--and accounted for four of the top 10. Hewlett-Packard was the second-most prevalent vendor with 30.8 percent of the systems on the list. No other vendor had more than 5 percent of the list, but SGI, Dell and Cray each cracked the top 10 with a supercomputer based on its technology. The U.S. has the most systems, with 298, up from 267 a year ago. Europe lost some ground, moving down to 83 systems, while there are now 93 supercomputers on the list based in Asia-Pacific. China has almost caught Japan, which used to dominate the Asian rankings, said Horst Simon, associate laboratory director at Lawrence Berkeley Labs and one of the administrators of the list. Japan has 29 systems on the list to China's 28.
2006-12-29 - OpenVZ ported to Sun Niagara servers   OpenVZ, virtualization software that carves a single version of Linux into separate containers for different tasks, now is available for computers using Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc T1 processor. SWsoft, which launched the open-source OpenVZ project and bases its proprietary Virtuozzo product on it, created the port in response to a request by Jonathan Kinney, a data systems specialist at Advantagecom Networks who supplied a server for the UltraSparc T1 "Niagara" work and who plans to use the software at his company. The software can be downloaded from the project Web site. Linux is most widely used on servers using x86 processors such as Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron, but it also runs on many other processors. Programmers translated OpenVZ to machines using IBM's Power processor family in October, and it already was available for those with Intel's Itanium processor. Containers don't provide as much isolation between different partitions as virtual-machine technology such as Xen or VMware, which also can run different operating systems simultaneously. But containers impose a smaller tax on processing power and can easily be started and stopped. The two major Linux sellers, Red Hat and Novell, are planning to include OpenVZ in their products. Red Hat also supports the integration of OpenVZ into the Linux kernel at the heart of the open-source operating system, a move that would spread the technology more widely. Sun's Solaris version of Unix is most widely used on UltraSparc T1 machines. Solaris 10 already possesses an OpenVZ-like technology called Containers and is getting other options. Sun encourages use of Linux on the Niagara servers, however.
2002-12-04 - Open-source clan in spat with Sun  A leading OpenBSD programmer has accused Sun Microsystems of hindering development of the open-source software for its newer computers, causing Sun to scramble to cooperate with the project in response. OpenBSD project leader Theo de Raadt said he's been trying for a year to obtain low-level details from Sun about its UltraSparc III chip. Without it, OpenBSD programmers have been unable to boot their operating system on newer Sun systems. Sun has now promised to give OpenBSD the same information it provided to higher-profile, open-source projects such as Linux. "Sun has committed to working with OpenBSD to...ensure they are extended the same information as other open-source communities," the company said in a statement. The tussle illustrates the sometimes awkward interaction between the free-wheeling, open-source world and the more staid corporate realm. While companies such as Sun, IBM and Hewlett-Packard have been trying to tap into the vitality and products of the open-source world--which allows anybody to modify and redistribute its shared software--cultural and legal barriers persist. "There's no one you can talk to. Everybody stonewalls you," de Raadt said of Sun in an interview. De Raadt escalated his efforts last week in a posting to an OpenBSD e-mail list, requesting that programmers send the Sun executive responsible requests to release the necessary information. The strong-arm tactic has worked in the past to get companies such as Adaptec and QLogic to share information, he said. But Sun didn't put its open-source community liaison officer, Danese Cooper, in touch with de Raadt until after CNET News.com informed the company of his dissatisfaction. Cooper is "already well-known in the open-source software community," Sun representatives said. But the company acknowledged it needs to improve its work with open-source groups, saying the task would be addressed "within the next few weeks." Cooper has been responsive and is pressing the OpenBSD case within Sun, said de Raadt, but he's reserving judgment until he gets what he needs. "I'm not jaded, but I don't accept that reality has changed until the documentation has arrived," he said. De Raadt has a history of not mincing words or shunning controversy. He's refused to back down in a trademark fight with SSH Communications Security over the OpenSSH name and, he rejected a software utility when its author explicitly forbade others from changing the program. OpenBSD, like FreeBSD and NetBSD, is an open-source version of Unix that stemmed from work at the University of California at Berkeley. OpenBSD programmers also develop OpenSSH, widely used software that controls Unix computers over a network and uses encryption technology to protect information such as passwords. Sun's open stance As an illustration of how deeply open-source software has penetrated the traditional computing realm, Sun adopted a version of the OpenSSH product in its own systems. In what's largely a marketing strategy against rivals Microsoft and IBM, Sun touts its openness. As examples, the company says it has no hidden interfaces to its Solaris operating system and trumpets that it supports royalty-free standards; that it shares the control of Java with many other companies; that it has released several important software projects as open source; and that it promises no nonstandard extensions will prevent customers from being able to substitute another company's software for Sun's. This claim to openness rankles de Raadt. "If Sun says they are open, they need to start acting it," he said in his Open BSD posting last week. However, Sun has taken the lead in several open-source projects. For example, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has released software for better encryption in Web site transactions, in addition to introducing its OpenOffice competitor to Microsoft Office, its NFS file-sharing software, its Jxta peer-to-peer experimental software and its Grid Engine calculation software. The company's relations with the open-source community haven't always been rosy, though--open-source advocates were displeased with Sun's decision to show the source code but not share the control of its Java software. More recently, it took months for Sun and the Apache Software Foundation open-source group to hammer out an agreement on working together. But for his part, de Raadt believes other companies have been more helpful to OpenBSD programmers--Advanced Micro Devices, for example, has been eagerly soliciting open-source programmers' support to try to help the prospects of its coming 64-bit Opteron chip, code-named Hammer, which competes against Intel's Itanium line. "We have documentation for Hammer, and Hammer isn't even shipping yet," he said. UltraSparc nitty-gritty As for Sun's UltraSparc III chip, OpenBSD needs details on how it uses high-speed cache memory and regular main memory, de Raadt said. "There are some low-level cache and memory management unit interactions that seem to be very different from the way it used to be on the older UltraSparc I and II. We run on old (UltraSparc) I and II machines," he said. David Miller, a Red Hat employee in charge of the UltraSparc III version of Linux, received documentation on the processor after signing a nondisclosure agreement with Sun. Still, he said in an e-mail interview, it wasn't simple: To deduce Sun hardware bugs the company didn't tell him about, Miller had to decode Sun's upgrades to Solaris. Miller believes that it's "obvious" how the UltraSparc III works after looking at the UltraSparc III version of Linux. But the OpenBSD programmers have tried that strategy to no avail, de Raadt said. OpenBSD on UltraSparc III isn't a mere curiosity. De Raadt is particularly interested in UltraSparc III features that are well-suited to OpenBSD's emphasis on security--for example, memory protections that make computers less vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. And there are customers interested in an OpenBSD version for UltraSparc III machines. University of Alberta's Bob Beck said he is forced to buy out-of-date UltraSparc II-based E450 servers instead of newer UltraSparc III-based V880 machines for the university's SunSITE software exchange. "I want to run OpenBSD on (UltraSparc III systems), because I can do stuff with it for routing, security and traffic control that I cannot do even with a $100,000 Cisco box," Becker said in an e-mail interview.

2001-04-23 - Ohio center upgrades Cray supercomputer    The Ohio Supercomputer Center has ordered a $1.6 million upgrade to its Cray SV1 supercomputer, doubling its memory to 64GB and swapping its processors with faster models used in the new SV1ex line. The upgrades to the current 16-CPU machine will be done in mid-2001, Cray said Monday. The Ohio center, a joint effort of several universities, uses the system for research on air pollution, braking systems, chemistry and other areas. In addition, Cray has signed a contract with the Ohio center under which it will provide training for use of the Cray systems. In May, the Ohio center also plans to install a 160-processor supercomputer made of interconnected systems based on Intel's upcoming Itanium CPU, the organization said.
2001-09-26 - Of myths and mergers   Since Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer announced their merger, volumes have been written about the combination, much of it focused on PC market consolidation or creating scale to cut costs. But those stories, frankly, miss the point. Steps like the one Michael Capellas and I took are based on a shared commitment to our customers, employees and shareowners to lead and drive the industry through its next inflection point--the accelerating shift toward market-unifying architectures and approaches. Why are market-unifying standards such as Itanium, Unix/Linux, NT, open source, open APIs, and open connectivity standards so important in the context of our merger with Compaq and the future of the technology industry? Because market-unifying standards will shift the underlying economics and the basis of competition in this industry by leading to more competition, greater choice and flexibility for businesses, and better ease of use for consumers. They will also lead to more advantageous cost models for technology suppliers, which can be passed on to customers in the way of lower costs. By combining HP and Compaq, we are committing to market-unifying, industry standards-based architectures and approaches across every level of the technology stack and across every category we compete in from infrastructure to access devices to printing and imaging. Fundamentally, this merger is about three things: 1. It's about becoming a better, strong supplier to our customers with unmatched depth and breadth in products, solutions and services. A supplier that recognizes that the real world of business prioritizes speed and choice, flexibility, and return on investment over proprietary, inflexible, old-world approaches to technology that shackles businesses to their past and to their IT vendors. 2) It's about becoming a better, stronger ally for our partners. By combining forces and leveraging our partners more aggressively, we can accelerate the development and adoption of open, market-unifying architectures including Itanium and Linux, thereby creating new markets, new momentum, and new opportunities for our partners to innovate. 3) It's about having a clear, pragmatic view of the economics of the industry--economics that suggest that going forward, research and development and sales and marketing leverage and scale will determine market leadership. The new HP will have more "capital effective" R&D efforts as a result of greater product and services breadth, and a better overall cost model created by increased volume and velocity. In fact, no company will have better-leveraged and more effective capital utilization in the industry than the combined HP and Compaq. This means we will be able to redirect dollars into inventing and innovating across our products and solutions, and increase our sales and marketing coverage in locations, customer accounts, and retail and commercial channels around the world. As a result of this combination, companies whose businesses rely on vertically integrated, proprietary technology architectures--from the processor up through the software stack--will be challenged. These companies will have to fundamentally rethink their business models in the next two years as standards-based approaches gain momentum. At the same time, companies whose current economic models are solely based on volume and velocity will not be able to gain the R&D and sales and marketing leverage to innovate and differentiate long term. Why now? A global economic downturn and a tech recession make it precisely the time to do a merger like this one. It gives us time to complete the heavy lifting required in the months ahead so that we can indeed emerge a stronger, more focused competitor when the economy does turn around. HP and Compaq are appropriately sober and pragmatic about what's required to integrate these two companies. Both management teams took this into account when we evaluated the logic of the merger, and we both concluded that the strategic rationale and benefits to customers, shareowners and employees outweigh the risks. We had a business plan and an integration plan done before we ever called a banker. The Compaq management team carries near-term memories of what worked and what didn't in the Digital Equipment acquisition. And the HP management team understands the operational rigor because we successfully completed the largest spinoff in corporate history--the spinoff of Agilent. Dispelling myths Let me conclude by dispelling the three most common myths that surround this merger: 1) This is not predicated on PCs. It's actually all about enterprise computing and professional services. The new company will have a balanced overall portfolio with scale, scope, breadth and depth across a range of product categories--and an unmatched ability to service and support customers with more than 68,000 experts in configuring, optimizing, managing and maintaining IT infrastructure. 2) The merger does not signal any change in the importance of imaging and printing systems to HP. HP remains convinced that having an imaging and printing franchise and a computing systems franchise will continue to be a competitive differentiator, particularly as the physical and digital worlds become even more intertwined. 3) This is not a defensive move. It's an offensive move. It's about leading, not following. It's about becoming a better, stronger supplier to customers. It's about becoming a better, stronger ally for our partners. It's about generating greater R&D and sales and marketing leverage. We intend to reshape the economic structure of the industry and to force our competitors to respond.

2001-08-09 - NSF awards 53 million supercomputing bid   The National Science Foundation has awarded contracts worth $53 million to build a grid that connects supercomputer clusters across the country into a single large computing resource called the Distributed Terascale Facility. The main part of the work will be handled by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and the San Diego Supercomputer Center, said NCSA Director Dan Reed. But a big winner will be IBM, which will build four Linux supercomputer clusters and take home tens of millions of dollars, said Mike Nelson, director of Internet technology and strategy at IBM. The NCSA's cluster will be able to perform 6.1 trillion calculations per second (teraflops), and SDSC's will handle 4 teraflops, Nelson said. Argonne National Laboratory will have a 1 teraflop machine and the California Institute of Technology a 0.4 teraflop machine. The supercomputers will be made from Intel's "McKinley" CPU, the second generation model of the Itanium line, the National Science Foundation said in a statement. In addition, Qwest will link the computers with a high-speed network that can transfer data at 40 gigabits per second. IBM has embarked on a project to improve grid computing--which federates high-powered computers to give researchers access to supercomputer calculation facilities--and to speed up access to large databases of information. Big Blue believes the technology, chiefly appealing to academics at present, will become useful to corporations as well. "We're pulling the pieces together. We'll be providing a lot of hardware that uses the McKinley chip," Nelson said. "We think grid computing could be just as big as Linux." The system, which Reed and SDSC Director Fran Berman called the Teragrid, will be used for work involving national and international collaborations, Reed said. Computing jobs will include work in the areas of astronomy, cosmology, earthquake simulation, genetics, protein research, drug design, brain research and high-energy physics, Berman and Reed said. A national board will decide how the computing power is allocated, but using it should be made simpler through the choice of open-source grid software from an organization called the Globus Project, he said. Scientists won't have to worry about where exactly data is stored or what computers are churning through their calculations. "It's trying to take a distributed cluster and data architecture and build an easy-to-use interface on top of it," Reed said. Ultimately, the grid will grow to include smaller research networks, link to other grids overseas and even incorporate countless sensors across the world, Reed said.
2003-08-04 - Novell snaps up Linux company Ximian   Networking software maker Novell on Monday boosted its Linux portfolio with the acquisition of Linux software maker Ximian for an undisclosed sum. Special Coverage It's a LinuxWorld Read CNET News.com's complete coverage from the Linux gathering. The purchase of Ximian's desktop Linux software will complement Novell's efforts to sell tools for managing networks of Linux servers, the company said. Novell plans to create a business unit called Novell Ximian Services. Executives from the two companies said the union will help drive adoption of the Linux operating system in corporations. "Ximian brings Novell unparalleled Linux expertise," Novell CEO Jack Messman said in a statement. Novell pledged to continue fostering two high-profile, open-source efforts under the auspices of Boston-based Ximian, including the GNOME project for creating a Linux desktop and the Mono project, which will allow companies to run Microsoft .Net applications on Linux. The deal could also rekindle decades-old battles between Novell and Microsoft, said Chad Robinson, an analyst at the Robert Frances Group. Ximian's Desktop software is one of the most popular Linux application bundles, and Novell has the resources to sell it into corporations where Microsoft's Office software dominates on PCs, he said. "Many companies have looked to take on Microsoft from different angles but they've usually fought Microsoft on the server level," said Robinson. Microsoft executives have singled out Linux as one of the company's primary competitive challenges in the coming years. With the Ximian purchase, Novell could mount a "a huge challenge to Microsoft on the desktop," said Robinson. The company has tried to confront Microsoft's desktop application dominance in the past. During the 1980s and 1990s, Novell launched its own line of e-mail and personal productivity applications, but failed to loosen Microsoft's hammerlock on the industry. Now, Novell's revenue stems primarily from its server software. But sales of its flagship NetWare operating system have stalled over the past years, largely due to the popularity of Microsoft's Windows. The company lately has pushed into Linux in an effort to cash in on corporate interest in the open-source operating system. The acquisition of a high-profile Linux provider should raise Novell's profile in the industry, Robinson said. "Between Novell's enterprise Linux strategy and the Ximian acquisition, they're trying to reclaim the spotlight," said Robinson. "Linux is clearly a strategic play for Novell." Novell has developed a series of administration and security tools for managing Linux networks. In about 18 months, it plans to offer on Linux the same networking services it offers with NetWare, including directory software for authenticating a person's identity, according to the company. The company's backing should bolster the Mono project, an ongoing effort to create an open-source version of Microsoft's .Net development software. Once the project is completed, developers using open-source Mono tools should be able to create .Net applications that run on Linux or Unix. Ximian plans to release the first full version of Mono by the end of the year. Applications built using Microsoft's Visual Studio .Net development tools are designed to run only on the company's Windows operating system. Ximian also provides a suite of tools for running desktop applications, such as e-mail and calendars, on PCs that use Linux. Ximian's Desktop 2 product allows people to share documents saved in the Microsoft Windows file format. The company has developed Red Carpet, a popular utility for automatically updating different versions of Linux on PCs. Over time, the two companies plan to combine Red Carpet with Novell's ZenWorks product line, which can send out software updates to Windows-based desktop PCs. As part of the deal, Novell said it will continue supporting the open-source development projects sponsored by Ximian. Ximian grew out of the GNOME project, which was started in 1997 by Ximian co-founder and chief technology officer Miguel de Icaza. Ximian Desktop is based on GNOME, an application that gives Linux PCs graphical presentation tools.
2006-01-27 - Next Itanium consumes less power   SAN FRANCISCO--Intel's forthcoming "Montecito" member of the Itanium processor family will consume 100 watts, a significant drop from the 130 watts of current models and an advantage in an era when power consumption is a top enemy. Intel spokesman Scott McLaughlin confirmed the figure at an Itanium Solutions Alliance meeting here. The change means Itanium will have about 2.5 times the performance per watt of the current Itanium 2 9M model. The major reason for the lower power is the shift to a new manufacturing process employing 90-nanometer features, which means the circuitry can be made smaller compared with the 130-nanometer size used by the current Itanium, McLaughlin said. (A nanometer is a billionth of a meter; Intel's PC processors are already produced on a more advanced process with 65-nanometer features, and the chipmaker just demonstrated a prototype with 45-nanometer features.) "A 100-watt envelope for 1.7 billion transistors--that's a heck of a deal," said Microprocessor Report Editor in Chief Kevin Krewell. "Performance per watt is becoming a more critical metric." But part of the lower power consumption came because Intel sacrificed features and clock speed in an October delay of Montecito, Krewell said. Intel lowered Montecito's top speed to 1.6GHz from 1.8GHz and dropped a feature called Foxton that would have let the chip jump to 2GHz if it was running cool enough. "It's disappointing that something they hoped would provide a greater kicker couldn't be there and that they delayed the launch for nine months to close to a year," Krewell said. Performance per watt has become a major focus at server companies trying to deal with increasing chip power consumption, computer equipment density and electricity prices. Sun Microsystems touts the 72-watt consumption of its UltraSparc T1 "Niagara" processor, and Advanced Micro Devices has touted the fact that its standard Opteron chips consume 95 watts compared with a range of 110 watts to 165 watts for Intel's rival Xeon. Google, a massive buyer of computing systems, has said power costs are likely to outpace server hardware costs if performance per watt doesn't change. Intel isn't ready to say whether 100 watts will be the new maximum permitted for Itanium systems of the future. However, McLaughlin said, "In our future, performance per watt is very important and not just a nice-to-have feature." Power improvements could give Itanium a much-needed boost. The high-end processor once was expected to sweep the server world, but because of delays, poor initial performance and software incompatibilities, Intel has had major difficulties getting Itanium to catch on. And though there is still widespread use of Intel's Xeon processor, an x86 model that unlike Itanium smoothly runs software for chips such as Pentium, it, too faces challenges. "Nothing that we heard from Intel this week changes our belief that AMD is going to take more share in server processors this year," Merrill Lynch analyst Joe Osha said in a report this week. But Itanium backers are forging ahead. At the Itanium alliance meeting, Intel and eight server makers declared they're spending $10 billion on Itanium research, development, marketing and support for software companies. The meeting drew several high-ranking executives, including Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini and Bob Muglia, Microsoft's senior vice president in charge of servers and tools. Hewlett-Packard, which codeveloped Itanium along with Intel and remains the chip's major backer among server makers, believes Itanium has an advantage when it comes to power issues. "Power dissipation is a function of clock speed. Architectures like Itanium get more work done per clock cycle," said Don Jenkins, vice president of marketing for HP's Business Critical Server group. "That puts Itanium as an architecture in a very good place." But the initial promise that Itanium would execute more instructions per cycle hasn't panned out, Krewell said. "If that was the case, Itanium would be blowing away everybody in the marketplace," he said. "Software schedulers never got as good as the architects thought they would." Compared with today's Itanium chips, Montecito will roughly double performance in transaction processing tasks such as running databases. The chip has dual processing engines, called cores, and each core can execute two instruction sequences called threads.
2003-04-25 - New Windows stirs up server world  Microsoft's new Windows Server 2003 is opening up opportunities in the server landscape, particularly in the high-end area once dominated by Unix machines. With the arrival Thursday of the new server operating system, Windows now works on servers based on Intel's Itanium chip. The symbiosis between the two could carry the operating system into powerful back-end computers it hasn't been able to tackle in the past, and the Windows support could encourage more customers to use Itanium servers. The software release is giving new life to companies' prospects for the server market. For Intel, it's fueling hopes that Itanium will conquer high-end computing. Hewlett-Packard has a new way to sell high-end computers and a new sales pitch for low-end systems. And Dell Computer, which made the debut of its forthcoming Itanium-based server on Thursday, is looking to accelerate its market share gains. Microsoft wants the new operating system to replace Windows NT 4, the grandfather of Windows Server 2003 that runs on millions of servers, and is putting its biggest sales effort into that, said company CEO Steve Ballmer at Thursday's launch event. But Microsoft has been strong in such low-end servers for years, so the more strategically significant change would come in high-end machines. The top-end Datacenter Edition of Windows Server 2003 works on servers with as many as 64 processors, giving Microsoft new ammunition in its effort to displace previously untouchable servers--from IBM, HP and Sun Microsystems--that run the Unix operating system. HP is leading the high-end charge. On Thursday, an HP Superdome server with 64 Itanium processors running Windows took the top score in the widely watched TPC-C server speed test. At $6.4 million, the system isn't cheap, but it has the least-expensive cost per transaction* in the top 10 tested. The server maker expects the number of Superdomes it will sell will double or triple within two years as a result of the availability of Windows for Itanium. That's in part because the product line will benefit from Microsoft's sales effort for its new software, said Mark Hudson, head of marketing for HP's Business Critical Systems group. That predicted surge is significant, given that Superdomes typically cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often more than $1 million. A revenue boost would help HP, which is struggling to bring its enterprise computing group to profitability by the end of October. Hudson said that for every dollar HP gets from sales of high-end servers, it makes nearly two dollars more from HP services, storage, software and lower-end servers. "The ripple effect to the rest of the family is amazing," Hudson said. It's common that each high-end server sold is accompanied by the sales of 20 or 30 midrange servers and even more low-end models, he added. The first Itanium version of Superdome is set to arrive in late summer, Hudson said. The system will use Intel's Itanium 2 6M processor, the model code-named Madison that's scheduled to make an entry midway through this year. Later in 2003, HP will launch eight-processor and 16-processor models with Itanium. And in 2004, the product line will be upgraded with the faster Itanium 2 9M processor and mx2 technology, which doubles the number of Itaniums that can be plugged into each socket. Itanium, initiated and co-developed by HP, but manufactured and now designed by Intel, has had a rocky start. It was hampered by several delays and by the fact that software must be rebuilt to take advantage of its 64-bit nature, which permits it to use vast amounts of memory. Hudson said the arrival of Windows Server 2003 will accelerate software companies' moves to support the processor. At the Windows Server 2003 launch event, Intel Chief Operating Officer Paul Otellini promised major performance improvements with future versions of the processor. The Montecito chip, set to arrive in 2005, "will take the absolute performance up two to three times from where this (Superdome) machine is today," Otellini said. Another Itanium model that "will come out in a few more years takes performance up a factor of 10 from where this is today," he said. Otellini also noted that server makers are now building dozens of designs around Itanium, with more than 80 two-processor or four-processor designs and more than 15 eight-processor or larger designs expected in 2004. One of those new designs should come from Dell. It showed its first Itanium server Thursday, a dual-processor, rack-mounted model that is 3.5 inches thick. The system, set to arrive in the second half of this year, shared the stage with Ballmer, an HP Superdome and a Unisys machine that can accommodate both Itanium and Xeon processors. Dell representatives declined to comment on which Itanium its system will use, but a source familiar with the design said it will use the Itanium 2 6M processor. Windows Server 2003 will mean an acceleration in Dell's market share gains from No. 1 Intel server seller HP, said Dell's Jim Totton, vice president of Windows operating system and applications at Dell. The market in 2002 for servers using Intel processors or compatible models was $16.4 billion, according to research firm Gartner. "There is a pent-up need in the NT 4 (customer) base to move. We think it will be to Windows Server 2003, not to Windows 2000," Totton said. "I think the adoption rate will be faster than for Windows 2000." Dell's top competition will be Hewlett-Packard. There are 4.5 million computers using Windows NT 4, "2.5 million of those are ours," said Mary McDowell, head of HP's Industry Standard Server group. The actions of another server seller highlight the merits of the new operating system. Egenera, a maker of high-end Linux servers costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, has for the first time expanded to support Windows as well.
2003-03-28 - New Windows Server XP versions roll    Microsoft announced Friday that it had released two high-end operating systems to computer manufacturers. Windows Server 2003 is Microsoft's high-end business operating system, which the company hopes will extend its reach into the enterprise. Windows XP 64-bit Edition Version 2003 is designed for workstations running Intel's Itanium 2 processors. The release of Windows XP 64 could spur the adoption of Itanium-based workstations, which have not sold as well as expected, say analysts. Dell Computer released a workstation containing the original Itanium chip in 2001, but then quietly pulled it off the market. Although Dell hasn't come out with Itanium 2 computers yet, company executives said the direct PC maker will adopt the chip. Currently, Hewlett-Packard is the only major computer manufacturer offering Itanium 2 workstations. Microsoft on Friday also signed off on final code for SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition, which, like the new version of Windows XP, handles 64-bit instructions and is designed for Itanium 2 processors. Release to manufacturing, or "RTM," of the new high-end products clears the way for manufacturers to begin selling computers with the several pieces of software. Windows Server 2003 doesn't officially launch until April 24, but computer makers would be free to sell systems ahead of the official release, according to Microsoft. SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition will launch at the same event, along with a new version of Visual Studio .Net. At least one server manufacturer expects to be ready before the official launch date. Unisys said it will start shipping Windows Server 2003 systems immediately. But other manufacturers aren't interested in taking Microsoft up on that offer. Dell plans to wait to announce availability until April 24, a company representative said Friday. Dell plans to offer Windows Server 2003 across the company's entire line of PowerEdge servers, the representative said. IBM also plans to wait until the official launch date. The company will release two-, four- and eight-processor systems running Windows Server 2003 on April 24, a company representative said Friday. But Big Blue doesn't plan on releasing 16-processor servers running the software until June. MPC Computers (formerly MicronPC) doesn't plan to start offering the software, which will be available across the company's entire NetFrame server line, until after the official launch date. "We're still waiting on qualifying the product," a representative said. "There will be a pretty significant lead time." Gateway also is waiting for April 24 to put Windows Server 2003 on its machines, including two high-density servers set for their own launch a week from Monday. The companies wouldn't further discuss the reasons for the hesitation, but some computer manufacturers have faulted Microsoft for taking so long to finish up Windows Server 2003 code. At one point the company planned to release finished--or gold--code on March 12, but twice pushed back the date because of last-minute tweaking. Typically computer makers need at least six weeks to test a new operating system. In the case of server software used by businesses, more time is usually needed. For example, MPC plans on eight weeks of testing. The long road In a conference call with the media Friday morning, a giddy Bill Veghte, corporate vice president of Microsoft's Windows Server division, announced: "Today Windows Server 2003 was released to manufacturing. It is done." But the product has been a long time coming. From conception to release of final code, Windows Server 2003 has seen four different names and four release dates. In October 2000, Microsoft said the product would ship in the second half of 2001. But in April 2001, it pushed back delivery of the product to early 2002. In March 2002, the software giant again delayed delivery until the second half of the year. In November, the company delayed delivery for a third time, setting an April launch date. Microsoft's increased emphasis on security, set off by a January 2001 memo from Chairman Bill Gates, contributed to the product delays. Veghte said that Windows Server 2003 was "designed and built with enhanced security as a top priority." Microsoft spent more than $200 million in research and development on security, he added. Microsoft on Friday spoke of massive amount of interest in Windows Server 2003. Veghte described a public beta, or test, program involving the software as "the most significant customer preview program Microsoft has ever had." About 561,000 people signed up for the software, more than double the preview for Windows XP. Veghte did not say whether that figure overlapped with Office 2003 Beta 2. The 15-CD Office 2003 kit includes the Windows Server 2003 beta. With Friday's release to manufacturers, Windows Server 2003 extends to seven different versions. The main ones are Datacenter, for top-end machines with dozens of processors and high reliability requirements; Enterprise Server, for more mainstream multiprocessor servers; Standard Server, for low-end servers; and a new Web Server for low-end machines used to send Web pages to Internet browsers. Microsoft plans to release a fifth product, Windows Small Business Server 2003, in the third quarter. Also available: 64-bit versions of Datacenter and Enterprise versions for Itanium processors. As Microsoft prepares for the launch event, work continues on an array of Windows Server 2003 components that are shipping late. They include: Greenwich, Microsoft's new business-class instant messaging technology; Group Policy Management Console; collaboration tool Windows Team Services; security enhancement Windows Rights Management Services (RMS); and Windows Systems Resource Manager (WSRM), among others. Windows Team Services and Group Policy Management Console are expected to be among the first pieces to arrive. On Friday, Veghte said to expect the late components to ship "60 to 120 days after this milestone," referring to the Windows Server 2003 release to manufacturers. During the media conference call, Veghte dodged questions about Microsoft's next major operating system releases--Longhorn, the successor to Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 follow-up Blackcomb. "We're starting to flesh out what the next releases look like," Veghte said, deferring any other comments until after a planned Friday celebration regarding the release to manufacturers. In the meantime, work continues on the next service pack, or collection of bug fixes, for Windows XP. On Thursday, a new build of Windows XP Service Pack 2 leaked out of Microsoft. Another, earlier version leaked out Feb. 28. CNET News.com's Michael Kanellos contributed to this report.
2002-03-04 - New version of Microsoft business OS   Microsoft on Monday released Windows Datacenter Special Edition, a version of its high-end operating system for retail, financial, telecommunications and Internet service providers doing data mining and warehousing, online analytical processing and e-commerce online transaction processing. Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter in August 2000, but two other high-end versions of Windows also are in the pipeline. In August, the Redmond, Wash.-based company released Windows Advanced Server Limited Edition for Intel's Itanium processor. Last week, Microsoft disclosed that Windows .Net Server would ship in the second half instead of the first as previously indicated. The successor to Windows 2000 Server, .Net Server, is testing, currently at beta 3.
2000-07-12 - New technologies set stage for Intel server growth The convergence of several new technologies is setting the stage for a time when Intel servers will be seen as more than just overgrown desktop computers. Intel will release two major server-specific chips in the coming months--the 64-bit Itanium processor this year and the 32-bit Foster early next year--as well as several motherboards, chipsets and nearly complete servers that some companies will use as foundations for their own products. But these servers will benefit from more than chip upgrades. Invisible, yet critical, supporting technology such as the InfiniBand data transfer standard and server-specific chipsets from ServerWorks will also be part of these new systems. Major computer manufacturers such as IBM, Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard and Unisys also are taking the initiative to design high-end systems that will cram 16 or more processors into a server. The goal is to develop computers that will enable these companies to capture some of the status and profits currently reserved for makers of proprietary Unix servers. The Internet-driven server sales boom has proven extremely lucrative for Unix server leader Sun Microsystems. To date, Intel largely has been largely locked out of this market, as has Microsoft, which earlier today released a "preview" copy of a 64-bit version of Windows for Itanium. IBM, HP, Compaq and others that will promote InfiniBand and Itanium in servers are already competing in the upper reaches of the Unix market. But by cooperating on technological standards, these companies can undercut the leader because they are effectively pooling research. To a certain degree, the market, as far as design is concerned, will be two-pronged. Servers containing eight or more processors will largely depend on technology provided by computer manufacturers. Many of the servers containing four or fewer processors, however, will be based around designs, and often subsystems, from Intel. "We're growing away from being the chipheads we were," said Mike Fister, vice president of the enterprise server group at Intel. "We build and sell (servers) at multiple levels of integration. To some we sell 'white box' systems," the generic computers that lack only a brand label. Added Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood: "Nobody is expecting the volumes on the initial Itanium machines to be enormous." But "everybody wants to have a box. The path of least resistance is to go with Intel." Compaq, though, is bucking the trend with its four-processor Itanium machine, which features its own motherboard and chipset, said Paul Santeler, vice president of enterprise Intel servers for Compaq. "IA-64 is going to be something that's around for a long time. You either pay development costs now or later," he said. Reaching this point, though, hasn't been easy. A rocky past For one, Intel and those who would use its chips have wrestled for control over the server designs. And Intel product delays left the chip giant languishing when Sun's dominance injected new energy into Unix server lines. Even the standard-bearer of the new era, the IA-64 chip family from Intel, will face a lukewarm debut tempered by the modest pace of adoption. And Compaq's Santeler predicts that the support for IA-64 won't reach full steam until the second-generation McKinley chip arrives. Advantages will grow with time, however. The Itanium chip and, more important, McKinley and other successors in the IA-64 family will give Intel servers the ability to use massive databases available today only on Unix servers, mainframes and other proprietary designs. Compaq's first Itanium system will hold as much as 64 gigabytes of memory--far more than the 4GB practical with current Intel chips, Santeler said. In addition, the chip family has features that will allow it to be used in multiprocessor systems with numerous CPUs and that make the computer less likely to crash, said Ron Curry, director of IA-64 marketing. Chipsets in play Chipsets, which join the CPU, memory and other central components, are finally receiving the attention once reserved for CPUs. A company called ServerWorks is building chipsets specifically designed for servers. ServerWorks has licensed high-end server technology from IBM in a five-year agreement. The deal will make possible mainstream systems that are more reliable and that aren't afflicted with today's comparatively slow internal data transfer speeds of today's Intel servers, said ServerWorks chief executive Raju Vegesna. ServerWorks has a technology agreement that ensures its products will be able to communicate with Intel chips through 2008. Its server specialization allowed it to win a presence in every one of the biggest server makers' products. ServerWorks' chipsets will be for mainstream computers, but several higher-end chipsets also are on the way. IBM is working on a Summit chipset that will allow for 16-processor IA-64 machines, said Tom Bradicich, director of the architecture of IBM's Intel servers. HP also has its own chipset that will enable 16-CPU IA-64 servers, said Duane Zitzner, president of HP's computer division. Unisys already has a server, its ES7000, that will support 32 IA-64 chips, and Compaq is selling it under its own name. NEC and Hitachi also have designs in the pipeline that will support systems with 16 or more IA-64 CPUs, Intel's Walker added. Compaq is building a chipset called the F8 that will enable 8-CPU Foster servers. "We're really excited about Foster," Santeler said. The chip comes with 10 parallel memory controllers to ensure that the CPUs can communicate with memory fast enough, he said. InfiniBand will arrive in 2001 as a way to speed connections to networks and storage systems and as a way to join computers in high-performance cooperatives. IBM has announced it's making InfiniBand chips. Though the technology will arrive in time for the McKinley chip in the second half of 2001, "there are people targeting earlier processors," said Jim Bowers, architecture marketing manager at IBM. InfiniBand's obvious use is to plug devices such as network cards and hard disk controllers into a computer. But the more powerful use in all likelihood will be joining processors into clusters that can work cooperatively or take over from each other when one fails, analysts say. Bowers said InfiniBand will be used across a vast spectrum of Intel servers, costing anywhere from $2,000 to $250,000, though it first will show up in midrange systems.
2005-06-22 - New supercomputers overhaul top ranks  Building one of the world's 10 fastest supercomputers takes a lot of work, but the prestige is increasingly likely to be short-lived. In the latest list of the 500 fastest supercomputers, released Wednesday at the International Supercomputing Conference in Heidelberg, Germany, five of the top 10 systems are new to the list. IBM dominates that top echelon: It built six of them, five using the Blue Gene design that packs 1,024 processors into each six-foot tall cabinet. The Top500 list is updated twice yearly by researchers at the University of Mannheim, the University of Tennessee and the U.S. Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It ranks computers by how many trillions of calculations per second, or teraflops, they can perform using algebraic calculations in a test called Linpack. Supercomputers are used for tasks such as automotive design and pharmaceutical research, but developments in the market often can influence mainstream machines as well. High-ranked systems increasingly are clusters of hundreds or thousands of low-end machines rather than single powerful behemoths. Turnover on the list is rampant. The slowest machine today is about as fast as the collective performance of the first Top500 list in June 1993. The November 1998 list had one system faster than 1 teraflops, but now all 500 exceed that mark. And the top performer, IBM's 65,636-processor Blue Gene/L at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is faster than the collective performance of the entire list of November 2001. IBM bumped the Blue Gene/L performance from its March milestone of 135.5 teraflops to 136.8 teraflops. And Big Blue expects to maintain its top rank on the next version of the list in November as the Livermore Blue Gene system is again doubled in size. "Our expectation is that it will benchmark in the 270 to 280 teraflops range," said Dave Turek, vice president of deep computing at IBM. A similar but smaller system, Watson Blue Gene (BGW), arrived to take second place with 91.3 teraflops. There are 16 Blue Gene machines total on the list. Blue Gene systems cost about $2 million per rack, but IBM sells partial racks as well, Turek said. The company is working on a separate Blue Gene design code-named Cyclops that's geared for life sciences work, but Turek said, "We have no plans to do anything with respect to commercialization of Cyclops." IBM built more than half the systems on the list--increasing from 216 systems on the last list to 259 on the current list. "IBM remains the clear leader in the Top500 list and increased its lead," organizers said in a statement. Some of IBM's gains were at Hewlett-Packard's expense. HP dropped from 173 systems to 131. But in the broader high-performance computing market--not just the rarefied Top500 domain--HP leads Big Blue. According to market researcher IDC, HP held 34 percent of the $1.9 billion market in the first quarter of 2005, ahead of IBM's 28.2 percent, Sun Microsystems' $12.3 percent, Dell's 11.9 percent and SGI's 2.6 percent. Chipmaker Intel also reached a milestone on the list. For the first time, more than half the systems--254 in total--use its Xeon processor. However, use of the higher-end Itanium processor diminished from 84 in the last list to 79. Intel's top rival, Advanced Micro Devices, built the Opteron processors used in the No. 10 system, a new machine called Red Storm built by Cray for Sandia National Laboratories. It was clocked at 15.2 teraflops, but a Sandia spokesman said the full system isn't expected to be running until sometime before October. Cray and Sandia predicted performance of 100 teraflops a year ago. Correction: This story included an incorrect number for Itanium-based machines on the newest list of the 500 fastest supercomputers. There are 79 such systems on the list.
2005-04-27 - New Sun priorities could speed Niagara servers Sun Microsystems likely will switch the order of arrival of two forthcoming server models, putting a higher priority on systems using the comparatively radical Niagara processor. Shipping Niagara-based servers could be a boon for Sun, which is seeking to keep its Sparc family of processors competitive but which has had trouble bringing new processors to market on schedule. But advancing Niagara's schedule would come at the expense of slowing down a more conventional processor, the UltraSparc IIIi+. "We may choose to release Niagara before the IIIi+," Andy Ingram, vice president of marketing for Sun's Sparc-based servers, said in a Wednesday interview. "We think bringing Niagara to market sooner has a higher value to us and our customers." Boosting Niagara would boost Sun, said Insight64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. "If they could accelerate Niagara--even by a few months into this calendar year--that would be a phenomenal boost for the company," he said. For one thing, it would "demonstrate that their execution has been very crisp on this program," and for another, it would let customers evaluate systems, Brookwood said. If Niagara lives up to Sun's claims, it will provide high enough performance and consume little enough electricity that the company could attract new customers to Sparc. Niagara has been due to arrive in systems in 2006, but Ingram said customers have prototype systems today and an earlier shipment date is possible. "The latest will be early 2006 that we introduce the products," he said. "It's coming in better than any other processor we've ever produced." Sun's UltraSparc processors are the foundation of a server line that was tremendously popular in the 1990s but has lost share to systems based on Intel's Xeon and IBM's Power family since then. And Intel continues to push its Itanium processor, sold chiefly by Hewlett-Packard. Sun's response has been threefold. It's aggressively pushing Sparc designs: Niagara, its Niagara II sequel, and its high-end cousin Rock. The company signed a deal to use Fujitsu's high-end Olympus processor as a replacement for its canceled UltraSparc V. And it's designing new "Galaxy" servers based on Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron processor, an x86 chip compatible with Intel's Xeon. Niagara combines eight processing cores on a single piece of silicon, and each core can execute four simultaneous sequences called threads. Sun believes a single Niagara machine will be able to replace several independent machines. In contrast, the UltraSparc IIIi+, which had been scheduled to arrive in 2005, has a single processing core that can execute a single thread. It will be used to update current low-end Sparc servers such as the V440, V240 and V210. Sun doesn't have the resources to simultaneously test and qualify servers using both processors, Ingram said. In particular, government requirements called "reduction of hazardous substances" is requiring Sun and its suppliers to switch many new electronic components that must be retested, he said. Niagara doesn't necessarily execute a single task faster than more-conventional processors, but it's designed to rapidly switch from one task to another so the chip can stay gainfully occupied while one task waits to fetch data from relatively slow memory. The result is that it can perform more tasks at the same time, giving it 15 times the "throughput" of an UltraSparc IIIi processor. The UltraSparc IIIi+, in contrast, will have only double the throughput. Ingram hinted that Niagara might exceed that factor of 15. "The performance will be at least 15x. It might be even better," he said. Niagara systems will have a single processor, but Sun plans different server models with various memory and expansion capacities, Ingram said. Power consumption is a big part of the Niagara sales pitch. The processor consumes 56 watts of power, Sun has said. Opterons consume 95 watts, and Xeons consume between 90 and 130 watts, Brookwood said. "Everyone in data centers these days is focused on power," he said. Also coming in the second half of this year are new high-end systems with the UltraSparc IV+, a sequel to the current UltraSparc IV. Those systems could help lagging high-end system sales that have hurt Sun of late, Ingram said. Sun also plans to release Opteron-based systems in the second half. High-end servers have great profit margins but don't ship in large volume; low-end servers have the opposite properties, but the Opteron machines will be comfortably in between, Ingram said. "That's the sweet spot," Ingram said. "That's where Sun has always made most of its money."
2001-04-23 - New Pentium 4 to turn up heat on PC prices Intel on Monday released a 1.7GHz Pentium 4 processor--and with it, a scorched-earth approach to the PC market. As earlier reported, the new chip, which will be featured in a number of PCs from major manufacturers, will increase overall desktop performance, especially on entertainment applications such as video encoding, according to company executives. Equally important, Intel will slash the price of the Pentium 4 line and pour millions into advertising and software-developer programs to ensure the chip penetrates nearly every segment of the sleepy PC market. The 1.7GHz Pentium 4 will sell for $352 when it debuts, with PCs incorporating the chip selling for just less than $1,800, monitor included. Price cuts on 1.3GHz, 1.4GHz and 1.5GHz Pentium 4 chips slated for the following week will drop the base price of computers using the chip to the $1,000 mark. A little more than a year ago, 1GHz chips alone cost $1,299. "In corporations, (buying Pentium 4 computers) becomes a no-brainer. The price moves are incredibly aggressive," said Van Baker, a vice president at Gartner. "For consumers, for the kind of applications Intel is talking about--video streaming, audio--it offers significantly better performance." More applications also will begin to emerge that are optimized for the chip, said Anand Chandrasekher, vice president of microprocessor marketing at Intel. The company will spend roughly $500 million on promoting its technology with software developers, with most of the activity geared toward the Pentium 4 or Itanium, its new server chip. Another $300 million will go into advertising. "Up until now, it has been consumers, but we are going to start to ramp into the corporate environment," Chandrasekher said. "The new architecture enables a significant threshold of performance." Rival Advanced Micro Devices next week will provide its first public demonstration of dual-processor Athlon workstations at the National Association of Broadcasters show in Las Vegas. Dual-processor Athlon machines will come out later in the quarter, sources said. The price cuts don't come without pain, however. The chip still costs far more to produce than the Pentium III, according to many analysts, although Chandrasekher said manufacturing costs are declining. AMD, which increased market share by four percentage points last quarter, will also likely feel a price pinch. CEO Jerry Sanders has said that the company will match Intel pricing for chips rated at the same speed. The 1.3GHz Athlon sells for $318, which means AMD will have to chop the price 39 percent to keep pace with Intel. The price issue will also likely not abate. Although AMD has been able to equal and even best Intel when it comes to chip design, Intel far outstrips AMD when it comes to factory capacity. The price of a cheaper chip By the end of the year, Intel will be producing Pentium 4s in seven plants, Chandrasekher said. AMD has two plants. Often in the past, the production imbalance has allowed Intel to undercut AMD in volume and price. Intel, for instance, will move to the more economical 0.13-micron manufacturing process with the Pentium 4 in the fourth quarter, a quarter ahead of AMD, and also move more quickly to use larger 300-millimeter silicon wafers, which will cut manufacturing costs by around 30 percent. "Intel will be the lowest-cost producer, enhancing its gross margins and giving the company an edge in any price war," wrote Ashok Kumar, an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. The megahertz gap between the two companies will also grow. Right now, AMD's fastest Athlon tops out at 1.3GHz. By the third quarter, it goes to 1.5GHz. By then, the Pentium 4 will be hitting 2GHz, according to sources. "AMD is forced into a frequency matchup with Intel, which is beneficial to Intel," said Kevin Krewell, senior analyst with Microdesign Resources. Then again, the Pentium 4 to date hasn't sold as well as anticipated, according to, among others, Dan Niles of Lehman Brothers. AMD's share of the PC processor market rose from 17 percent in the fourth quarter of 2000 to 21 percent in the first quarter of 2001, according to preliminary numbers released by Mercury Research. Corporate buyers are also losing their Intel-only mentality. Athlon "has proven itself over the past two gears," said a manager of desktop support and strategy at a large Northeast manufacturing company, who asked not to be identified. "At this point, I'm looking at it as a possibility. I'm doing some benchmarks. A year ago, I don't know that I would have considered it." "I won't jump to Pentium 4 until the (PC) manufacturers make it attractive to me" with lower prices, he added. Staff writer John Spooner contributed to this report.
2003-06-30 - New Java aims to simplify  Sun Microsystems released a new version of its Java for desktop computers on Friday that aims to make the software faster, more familiar in appearance, and less daunting for nonprogrammers. Among other changes, the new version 1.4.2 of Java 2 Standard Edition will include buttons, menu bars, and other graphical elements that match the feel of Windows XP or the GNOME interface to Linux. Version 1.4.2 also offers a new control panel, an automatic update feature, and a swifter response when taking actions such as displaying a list of files stored on a hard disk. The friendlier interface is part of an effort by Java inventor Sun to make Java software that average consumers will recognize and demand. Earlier this month at its JavaOne trade show, Sun announced a multimillion-dollar branding campaign to try to etch the Java logo and value into consumers' minds. A telling example of Sun's effort to extend the software's appeal beyond computer experts is the fact that the new version no longer prominently displays the most obvious Java action as "console"--a feature a handful of code jockeys may appreciate but few others understand, much less use. Version 1.4.2, code-named Mantis, also is the first to include full support for Intel's Itanium processor family. Intel released the third-generation Itanium, code-named Madison, on Monday. Earlier, incomplete Itanium support in 1.4.1 meant that programs ran about 20 to 30 times slower than in 1.4.2, Sun said. At JavaOne, Sun said version 1.4.2 was imminent. Its importance has increased with the announcement that the top two PC makers, Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard, will bundle Java on their laptops and desktops. Those deals have taken on added significance for Sun since a court decision last week that overturned a previous requirement that Microsoft include Java with Windows. Java lets a program run on many types of computers, such as those running Mac OS, Windows or Linux, without having to be changed for each one. That universality could undermine the power of Microsoft, whose Windows operating system is the foundation for most desktop computer software. Though Java initially was released as a desktop computing software product, its successes to date have been in areas where Microsoft isn't as strong: servers and cell phones. To tout Java's advantages, Sun established a new Java.com Web site. That Web site doesn't yet have the new version of Java available for quick installation, though it can be downloaded manually, and a Sun representative said the site should be updated soon. Version 1.4.2 speeds up some operations by taking advantage of special instructions Intel processors can understand, called SSE and SSE2 (streaming single-instruction-multiple-data extension). The new version also includes more than 2,400 bug fixes since 1.4.0, Sun said. Version 1.5, code-named Tiger, will include further performance improvements, Sun has said. It also will allow the use of "skins," customized user interfaces, and will take less time to start up.
2003-06-30 - New Itanium a breakthrough for Intel   With "Madison," Intel is hoping the third time's a charm. Learn more about Itanium Madison, the third member of the Itanium chip family, is Intel's best shot to date at taking on Sun Microsystems and IBM in the market for high-end server chips. If the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker succeeds with its ambitious plans, the higher end of the $43 billion server market will be remade around Itanium the way the lower end now centers on Intel's Xeon chips. The chip debuted Monday under the Itanium 2 name, along with new versions of the Xeon processor for midrange servers. Madison offers roughly 50 percent better performance over its most recent predecessor, according to Intel, and is already rated highly against the best chips audited benchmark tests. But just as importantly, Intel and its allies have finally begun attracting broad support from server makers and the software companies. By the end of the year, there will be more than 50 different Itanium 2 systems on the market. Similarly, the software customer base is expanding. More than 400 programs, including Windows, SAS Institute's business analysis software, SAP's accounting software, and Oracle's 9i database software, have been ported to Itanium 2. Customers using Itanium 2 in pilots or for actual work include Sun America, Agilent Technologies, British Petroleum and BMW. "It is gaining momentum. Intel is saying, 'We are committed to a road map, and we are improving every year, and we are powering through this with our marketing and manufacturing muscle,'" said Kevin Krewell, senior editor of the Microprocessor Report industry newsletter. "The most important thing was that they got a production release from Microsoft for a 64-bit version of Windows." Reader Resources Itanium 2 in depth CNET White Papers All high-end server chips today are 64-bit designs which, compared with 32-bit chips, can handle vastly more memory gracefully and can perform some tasks, such as encryption, more efficiently. Software designed to run on 32-bit chips, such as Intel's Xeon processors, must be rebuilt to take advantage of 64-bit features, and for Itanium, the software change was much bigger than for its competitors. Intel has argued that the sweeping change was required to create a new architecture that would last 20 years. Madison, like all Intel products, is named after a geographic place, a process that avoids potential trademark infringement potholes. Madison was named after a river that runs through Wyoming and Montana and symbolized "something that had a long reach and touched a lot of things," said Intel spokesman Seth Walker. Its predecessor, McKinley, was named after North America's tallest mountain. Winning support Today's gung-ho attitudes about Itanium are a stark contrast to the past, when delays, a weak economy and a lack of compatible software combined to curtail enthusiasm and sales. Intel has coaxed two key server makers into the Itanium camp. IBM, the top dog of the server market, introduced its x450 Itanium server on Monday. And Dell will release an Itanium 2 server, a strong endorsement given the company's preference for established markets and its past record with Itanium. The company released, but then quietly killed, a workstation based on the first Itanium and skipped the first Itanium 2, stating that there was zero demand. The loudest support comes from Itanium co-inventor Hewlett-Packard, which announced the new Integrity name for its Itanium server line on Monday, and which will begin selling its 64-Itanium Superdome in August. Lower-end eight- and 16-processor Integrity models are due later this year, and a Superdome upgrade with 128 Itanium processors is expected in January. HP is using Itanium to gradually replace its own PA-RISC processor. Mark Hudson, head of marketing for the company's server group, said the company expects revenue from Itanium systems to exceed that of PA-RISC in 2005. In part, that's because Itanium will run not just the company's version of Unix, called HP-UX, but also Windows and Linux. "We're getting dozens of new customers coming to the Superdome platform that we are seeing for the first time because of the Windows play," said Brian Cox, worldwide product line manager for HP's Business Critical Systems group. All three operating systems should be available by the end of September for Itanium, Hudson said. By the end of 2003, enough software companies will have Itanium versions to cover the businesses that today account for 85 percent to 90 percent of HP's PA-RISC revenue, Hudson said. If Madison becomes a watershed product, Intel will be ready to quickly capitalize on the momentum. Deerfield--a low-cost, energy-efficient version of the chip--will come out in the second half of the year for two-way servers as will a version of Madison specially designed for servers in clusters. A faster version of Madison with more cache will then debut in 2004. Montecito, an Itanium with two different processors in the same piece of silicon, will come out in 2005. In the middle of the decade, Intel is planning on coming out with another Itanium that will blend many of the features of the highly touted, but never released, Alpha EV8 chip conceived first by Digital Equipment. Many of the engineers on that project now work for Intel. "That thing is going to run 10 times faster than what you can do today," said Mike Fister, senior vice president of the Enterprise Platforms Group at Intel, and buyers will pay for its performance. "It is a lot cheaper to crash a car on a computer than in real life." But competitors aren't standing still. Sun is coming out with UltraSparc IV in 2004 and has ambitious plans to stay ahead. IBM, while selling Itanium 2 servers, will release its Power5 chip for its powerful Unix servers next year. Both companies have been long-established in the 64-bit computing market. IBM and Sun's RISC (reduced instruction set computing) chips are 64-bit models that can accommodate far more memory than 32-bit designs such as Intel's Xeon and Pentium. These RISC chips power expensive servers but require their own distinct software. One of the biggest advantages IBM's and Sun's new chips have over Itanium is that they don't force a "binary break," a requirement that most Itanium customers use new software instead of easily running older Xeon and Pentium programs on the new chip. Bridging the gap But Intel later in 2003 will try to bridge the gap between Itanium and Xeon with its IA-32 Execution Layer software, which lets an Itanium emulate a Xeon with respectable, if not stunning, performance. Also holding Itanium back is the fact that server customers--especially in today's financially strapped climate--tend to move at a glacial pace, making it difficult for Intel to take market share. A number of the corporations implementing Itanium only are using the chip in "proof of concept" trials, Fister conceded. Intel also is facing heat from below. Advanced Micro Devices released its Opteron chip in April, which can run the widespread 32-bit code used by Pentium and Xeon systems today as well as 64-bit software for heavier-duty tasks. IBM will use the chip in its servers, and Microsoft and major Linux companies have or soon will have software for Opteron. On Monday, AMD launched its Opteron 800, good for servers with four or more processors. Three smaller server companies--Appro, Aspen Systems and RackSaver--will sell systems using the chip, said AMD spokeswoman Cathy Abbinanti. But AMD doesn't have the financial strength of Intel. "That's the big question with Opteron. Can AMD stay on that very aggressive Intel-like frequency and performance treadmill?" said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. "When you're laying people off, it makes it difficult to meet release schedules." Intel itself is even a competitor. Five years ago, Intel was a minor player in server chips. Now, its Xeon chips dominate the market in one- and two-processor servers. Several large computing clusters, webs of small servers melded into de facto supercomputers, rely on Xeon. Itanium provides performance and reliability benefits over Xeon and actually costs only a little more than Xeon, but Xeon runs the familiar 32-bit code better. "The RISC share is being drawn down by Xeon," said Martin Reynolds, an analyst at Gartner. "One of the challenges Itanium faces is the tremendous success of Xeon." Investment and banking services company Raymond James Financial is sold on Itanium, though. Pilot tests showed performance jumped fivefold when it moved an application on a Xeon server to one with the same number of Itanium 2 chips, said Tim Eitel, chief information officer at Raymond James. Raymond James is running a data warehouse for financial advisers and sales managers on a 16-processor Superdome with second-generation Itanium 2 chips. It will upgrade to third-generation Madison chips soon and expand the system as it nears production use in October. Pricing could become one of the crucial issues for Itanium. If Intel can get server makers to price Itanium servers substantially below existing RISC-Unix machines, Itanium may begin to draw customers, Reynolds said. But because some of them sell RISC boxes, igniting a sudden revolution is difficult, he said. But those challenges are perhaps easier to manage than the performance and schedule problems that plagued the Itanium program in the past. Intel now has hit its stride with Itanium. "Intel at least so far is showing an ability to keep cranking the performance up," Illuminata's Haff said. "The first generation was awful, (second-generation) McKinley was very respectable, and this is more than respectable. It has very strong performance."
2000-10-26 - New InfiniBand technology to remake servers--eventually    A group of the most powerful computing companies has finished the first version of InfiniBand, but it'll still be awhile before the new technology reshapes computer designs. Gartner analyst Thomas Henkel says InfiniBand is a legitimate attempt to promote a least-common-denominator standard for network interconnection, but at the same time, the InfiniBand partners are not particularly willing to give up control over their proprietary products. see commentary A consortium of computing powerhouses has completed version 1.0 of InfiniBand, a standard that governs how CPUs in a server communicate with network cards and storage systems and eventually other computers as well. Computing companies have lofty aspirations for InfiniBand, expecting it not only to eventually replace today's PCI technology but also to completely rework corporate networks of computers and data storage equipment. Though the standard is finished, it will be months before it shows up in the first hardware products. InfiniBand adoption is likely to lag further as customers wait for the technology to mature. But most expect InfiniBand to prevail in the long run, based on promises of better reliability, faster communication speeds, and the backing of giants such as IBM, Intel, Sun Microsystems, Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer and Microsoft. Intel, like IBM, foresees a day when InfiniBand connections won't just link CPUs and network cards but join together dozens or hundreds of servers. Large numbers of servers made of almost nothing but a CPU and memory will be joined with InfiniBand to large switches that handle the group's networking needs, predicted Jim Pappas, director of initiative marketing for Intel's enterprise platforms group. Likewise, InfiniBand will connect these arrays of smaller servers to big back-end servers, the kind with dozens of processors and lots of memory to hold a large database, he said. InfiniBand also will connect all these servers to dedicated storage devices, Pappas said. One predictor of how well InfiniBand will fare can be seen in PCI-X, an extension to the existing PCI standard that doubles the data transfer speed and makes a few other improvements. Compaq, IBM and HP announced PCI-X with great fanfare in September 1998, promising products using PCI-X would be available in the second half of 1999. That timetable proved to be overly ambitious. Though products have yet to ship and chips supporting PCI-X are just beginning to emerge, there already is an 83-page list of corrections and updates to the standard. "Is there anything that shows up on time?" asked Raju Vegesna, founder and chief executive of ServerWorks, a company building chips for servers that will use PCI-X. He said his company's chips are ready, but manufacturers of PCI-X cards such as network adapters are lagging. PCI-X will arrive next year, he said. "I don't think there was really much prospect of 1999," said Tom Bradicich, director of architecture and technology for IBM's Intel servers. "Ratification of the specification took until about August 1999. It's more likely (products will arrive) in the beginning of 2001. The InfiniBand schedule also has slipped. It was originally set to arrive at the end of the summer, said Bradicich, who also is co-chairman of the InfiniBand effort. It simply took some time to review the draft InfiniBand specification and the numerous comments from the dozens of companies participating in the development of the standard. "We got 3,500 comments. We wanted to be very responsible," he said. InfiniBand likely will show up in the end of 2001, Bradicich said. "It will be in...midrange to high-end servers," he said. InfiniBand initially will be most popular with Intel's 32-bit Pentium CPUs, but in the longer term will be used with the 64-bit chips such as Itanium, Pappas said. Although he agreed products will be in customers' hands by the end of 2001, he said "volume won't start until 2002." Technologies similar to InfiniBand have been used in proprietary computer designs for years. The difference with InfiniBand is that it's so widely backed. In addition to hardware makers such as Compaq and Cisco adopting it, a host of companies will produce chips to enable it. Big-name companies such as Agilent Technologies, Lucent Technologies, IBM and Intel will see competition from start-ups such as Banderacom, Mellanox and Crossroads. InfiniBand differs fundamentally from "bus" technologies such as PCI. PCI's data pathway is shared among a number of devices. InfiniBand, on the other hand, establishes connections between one device and another--a CPU and the network card, for example--without having to share the connection with other devices. InfiniBand establishes these connections by using what amounts to a miniature network within the computer. The brain behind InfiniBand is a switch, essentially a large high-speed chip that manages all the connections. Another big difference between PCI and InfiniBand is political. IBM, Compaq and HP developed PCI-X on their own, with Intel joining in later. InfiniBand has more unified support, though it took months of wrangling before Intel on one side and IBM, Compaq and HP on the other reconciled differences to come up with a unified standard. Though InfiniBand has widespread backing, it still faces competition. Motorola and other telecommunications hardware makers have backed a competing standard, RapidIO. Other backers include Cisco, Nortel Networks and Lucent. RapidIO, for the most part, doesn't compete with InfiniBand, Pappas argued. RapidIO will be used chiefly within telecommunications equipment. "I haven't seen any indication that RapidIO is the right technology for the server interconnect," he said.
2003-03-13 - New IBM servers--a blade and a behemoth    In its attempt to conquer the Intel server market, IBM is working on two new systems that will expand the boundaries of Big Blue's product line. Reader Resources Blade technology TechRepublic One system, the 32-processor x445 coming later this year, is based on a second version of IBM's EXA chip, said Tom Bradicich, chief technology officer of IBM's xSeries Intel server line. At the other extreme of the product line will be a single-processor "blade" server, he said in a Tuesday interview. The new systems are part of IBM's striving to shift from being largely irrelevant in the $16 billion Intel server market to becoming a leading advocate that applies its own considerable server-technology expertise. IBM now is No. 3 in the Intel server market after No. 1 Hewlett-Packard and No. 2 Dell Computer. Some, including Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Milunovich, say Big Blue's effort is beginning to pay off. "IBM now makes money in Intel servers," Milunovich said in a Tuesday report. Intel servers are increasingly important for IBM. They're the most common foundation for Linux, the Unix-like operating system IBM has wholeheartedly embraced, and Gartner Group expects more revenue from sales of Intel servers than from Unix servers, which for years have been the largest segment of the market. The current EXA chipset is the foundation of the current x440 system that accommodates as many as 16 Intel Xeon processors and of an Itanium version that IBM Web sites refer to as the x450. Big Blue will begin selling the Itanium product within one or two months, said Susan Whitney, general manager of IBM's Intel server group, in an interview. "We'll have IA-64 (Itanium) capability in the next 30 to 60 days," she said. The EXA chipset shuttles data between a computer's processors, memory banks and input-output systems. The second-generation EXA chips have "directory tables" embedded into the silicon that speed up transfers of data from one part of the system to the other, making it possible to join more of the four-processor modules, Bradicich said. IBM was the second-ranked seller of higher-end Intel servers with four or eight processors in the fourth quarter of 2002, according to IDC. No. 1 HP sold $484 million worth of the systems versus IBM's $377 million. IBM's high-end servers haven't been able to live up to their full potential because Windows and Linux don't currently work well on servers such as the x440, x445 and x450, whose designs make for varying response times when a processor needs to retrieve information from memory. IBM has customers running a single instance of Windows on eight-processor servers today, but Windows Server 2003, coming April 24, will mean the operating system will be able to work well on 16-processor machines as well, Whitney said. The increasing sophistication of Intel servers plays to IBM's technical strengths, and the company is gleeful about the growing maturity. "In 1998, a PC server was a PC (turned) on its side. Today, we have 16-way SMP (symmetrical multiprocessing) systems, with virtualized partitions and robust system management tools at one end and highly dense, integrated blades at the other end," Whitney said. Blade servers are smaller systems that slide side by side into a single chassis, sharing components such as network connections and power supplies. Where Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer and Sun Microsystems began their blade lines with lower-end uniprocessor systems, IBM entered the blade fray with more powerful dual-processor and, next, four-processor models. IBM still is planning more powerful blades, though. In the second half of 2003, Big Blue will release blades with four Xeon chips and blades with two PowerPC 970 chips, IBM executives have said.
2003-10-17 - New HP AlphaServer the omega of the line   Hewlett-Packard plans on Monday to begin selling the last and most powerful model in the AlphaServer line, a series of servers that stretches back to a very different era in the computing industry. The 64-processor AlphaServer uses EV7 processors, the company said Friday. Previously, the top-end system was the 32-processor GS1280, released in July. The 64-processor model will be the last in the AlphaServer line, an HP representative said. However, HP plans to update it with a faster processor in 2004, the EV79, which the company said would be the final processor in the Alpha family. The AlphaServer line began at Digital Equipment and outlasted that company's 1998 acquisition by Compaq Computer. Compaq, though, decided to phase out the Alpha processor, adopting instead Intel's Itanium processor family. Alpha was respected for its speed, but the chip never caught on widely, despite temporary support from powerful allies, including Microsoft. It competed with chips from HP, Sun Microsystems, IBM and Intel. HP took over the AlphaServer line when it acquired Compaq in 2002. One major feature of the AlphaServer line will live on: the OpenVMS operating system. That software, born more than 25 years ago as VMS (Virtual Memory System), is being moved to the Itanium processor. Another operating system that runs on Alpha, the Tru64 version of Unix that also came from Digital Equipment, is being phased out in favor of HP-UX. HP engineers are working to bring some features of Tru64 to HP-UX, however. HP plans to announce improvements to Tru64 and OpenVMS on Monday. The company will also release a new entry-level AlphaServer that uses the EV7 processor, the company said.
2000-09-27 - New era dawns for Intel servers    Intel servers are getting nearly as brawny as their Unix server cousins as the chip giant attempts to elbow its way into the high-end market. IBM next year will launch a new server that can accommodate as many as 16 Intel CPUs, said Tom Bradicich, director of architecture and technology for IBM's Netfinity line of Intel servers. Hewlett-Packard yesterday announced a partnership to sell a competing 16- and 32-CPU design from Unisys and will bring Intel CPUs to its own top-end 64-processor server design in the second half of 2002, said Duane Zitzner, head of HP's computer systems group. Compaq Computer, meanwhile, is working on a chip set that will enable 16- and 32-CPU Intel servers using Intel's second-generation 64-bit McKinley chips in early 2002, said Mary McDowell, general manager of Compaq's industry-standard server division. The new systems are at the beginning of a new era for Intel servers, which are benefiting from a host of new technologies that should help them compete better against traditional Unix server designs from Sun Microsystems, HP, Compaq and others. Until now, Intel servers generally have not been able to crack into the high-end market for tasks such as housing huge databases. One of those new components is Windows 2000 Datacenter, the first version of Windows that can run on systems with 32 processors. Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer unveiled Datacenter yesterday in San Francisco, but the new operating system is not expected to grow much beyond test usage for months. Intel, expanding from its tight alliance with Microsoft, also has been pushing Linux and IBM's AIX 5L, formerly known as by its project name, Monterey. Meanwhile, Sun is busy with its own server revamp, selling its first servers based on the UltraSparc III chip today. Meta Group says Microsoft's development of Windows 2000 Datacenter is in part triggering IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq to all announce plans to market 16- and 32-processor Intel-based servers. see commentary Until Compaq comes up with its own design, it will offer the 32-processor Unisys ES7000, the company announced earlier this year. McDowell said Compaq shipments will begin next week. HP will start selling the ES7000 at the start of next year, Zitzner said. Both the HP and IBM designs accommodate not only today's 32-bit Intel processors but also next year's 64-bit Itanium chips from Intel, Bradicich and Zitzner said. Large databases--and thus corporate customers--demand the use of 64-bit chips to run large databases. The new IBM system is based on a new chip set, code-named Summit, Bradicich said. The first Summit-based servers will be released in 2001 along with Foster, the server version of the upcoming Pentium 4, and a later version will arrive with McKinley, the successor to the 64-bit Itanium chip due in 2002. HP, meanwhile, won't rely on Unisys forever for its high-end Intel systems. The new 64-processor Superdome Unix server will be able to use upcoming 64-bit Intel chips in the second half of 2002, HP has said. Intel and HP co-developed the much-delayed IA-64 chip line, and HP has been moving gradually to transfer its servers to the new chip architecture. Superdome currently uses HP's PA-RISC chips. The IBM design consists of as many as four processor "quads," each with four processors, its own memory and input-output abilities. The quads can communicate over a high-speed "scalability port," a technology that came from IBM's 1999 acquisition of Sequent. The IBM design will incorporate a number of higher-end features as well, Bradicich said, including the ability to swap out memory modules without shutting the server off, a first for Intel servers. The architecture works up to 16-CPU systems, but IBM also plans to sell it in smaller systems with four, eight or 12 processors. In a four-way configuration, IBM hopes to squeeze the chips into a rack-mounted server just 1.75 inches thick--a difficult engineering accomplishment given the heat that chips generate. Compaq also is working on a chipset that will enable eight-processor Foster systems, McDowell said.
2006-01-24 - New Egenera blades get liquid cooling  Blade server pioneer Egenera plans to announce on Tuesday its third-generation product, the BladeFrame EX, along with a partnership to keep the systems cool. The BladeFrame EX, like its predecessors, is a rack with as many as 24 individual blade servers and a price tag in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, said Susan Davis, vice president of marketing and product management. The new system doubles the number of gigabit Ethernet ports to 16, and its faster internal communications backplane will permit later upgrades to 10-gigabit-per-second Ethernet and 4Gbps Fibre Channel storage networks. A bigger difference is the close integration of cooling technology from Liebert, a subsidiary of Emerson Network Power. Liebert has been selling cooling systems that are mounted above computing systems in data centers, but with the Egenera deal, the company's cooling systems would be mounted directly to the back of the BladeFrame. The joint product, called CoolFrame, adds $300 to $400 per blade to the Bladeframe's price to include the cost of both the pump that transports the cooling fluid and Liebert's installation. Liquid cooling, a rarity in recent years, is making a comeback as processors get ever hotter and more densely packed. It's a problem for extreme gaming PCs, but it's an even bigger problem for data centers with hundreds of computers; because of heat issues, Google predicts electricity could soon cost more than computer hardware. Companies are responding. Silicon Graphics offers liquid cooling on its latest supercomputers, and IBM added a similar option in 2005 called the eServer Rear Door Heat Exchanger. A rack packed with servers today can consume about 20,000 watts of power and throw off a correspondingly large amount of waste heat, said Dan Busby, director of product design for Egenera. Using the Liebert cooling, the waste heat is only the equivalent of a rack drawing 1,500 watts, he said. Egenera is the first company with a tight partnership with Liebert, but others are in discussion, said Lennert Stahl, Liebert's senior product manager. "We are working with other companies as well on cooling solutions," Stahl said. Liebert's first-generation liquid cooling products, introduced in 2000, used water, but the current systems and the Egenera add-on use a coolant called R134a, Stahl said. A leak in the system produces only gas, not a liquid, he said. Liquid cooling systems don't remove overheating problems, but they can transfer the cooling process to a large-scale, high-capacity air conditioning system. Cooling is at the top of the agenda for chipmakers. The mantra of "performance per watt" is expected to be a major theme at the Intel Developer Forum this February, and its rival Opteron has been boasting about its processors' lower power requirements. Most of Egenera's systems use Intel's Xeon processors, but AMD's Opteron is gaining in popularity among the company's customers. "We first introduced Opteron at end of March. Opteron at this point is up to about 30 percent of what we're shipping," she said. "We've seen a high rate of adoption." IBM says its Opteron server customers are generally interested in analytical and technical applications, not mainstream business applications. But Davis has a different view of the work that customers put on Xeon and Opteron machines. "They're both pretty similar," she said. "A lot of people are running database applications, and Opteron seems especially well suited to that." Egenera has committed to ship BladeFrame models using Intel's high-end Itanium processors, but those won't begin shipping until later in the first half of 2006, Davis said. Initial models will use the presently shipping "Madison" model of Itanium, not the forthcoming dual-core Montecito version shipping later this year.
2004-11-08 - New clusters emerge at supercomputing show Dell unveiled on Monday a new server that can be networked into a single high-performance technical computer. Hewlett-Packard made a similar announcement on Monday. The announcements, coinciding with the SC2004 supercomputing show in Pittsburgh, reflect the growing popularity of computing clusters, which most often use the Linux operating system and processors from Intel or Advanced Micro Devices. While IBM, HP, Dell and Sun Microsystems all sell Linux clusters, smaller companies also are angling for the market, and two of them announced new venture capital investments Thursday. Photo: Dell Dell's PowerEdge SC1425 server Dell's new server, the PowerEdge SC1425, is a stripped-down cousin to its 1850 that also uses Intel's newest "Nocona" generation of 64-bit Xeon processors, said Paul Gottsegen, vice president of worldwide enterprise marketing. However, it doesn't include redundant power supplies and advanced hard drive features not required by cluster customers, letting Dell sell the 1425 for about $350 to $400 less than the 1850. The systems also come with Platform Computing's Platform Rocks software, which is used for passing messages among servers in a high-performance cluster, managing servers, deploying software and other tasks. With no operating system, the SC1425 costs $1,099. The systems can be purchased in groups of as many as 256, and Dell offers an eight-computer cluster for $33,500 including Red Hat Linux, installation, and a service contract. Hewlett-Packard, the top seller of machines for the high-performance computing market, also is introducing new cluster options, including servers based on new Itanium processors from Intel. The servers are a foundation of the company's new Unified Cluster Portfolio, which also includes HP's XC System Software to manage clusters, HP's Scalable File Share software for storage, and services to install and configure clusters. Cluster sales industry-wide are growing at 50 percent compared with the previous year, the company said. An HP Cluster Platform with 16 servers has a starting price of $62,000. HP also is working on a cluster-based graphics system that will be able to quickly display images as large as 100 million pixels. The HP Scalable Visualization System is in testing now and is scheduled for availability by the end of June 2005. Meanwhile, some are trying more exotic cluster designs. Ciara Technologies announced its new Linux-based VXR-3DT cluster that has between 16 and 19,440 Xeon processors. Computing nodes are attached to each other and to a storage system with 12x InfiniBand high-speed networking. The system is scheduled for general availability by the end of the year. And Appro showed off a new model of its own, the XtremeBlade products with a 12.25-inch tall chassis that can house blade servers with two, four or eight Opteron processors from Advanced Micro Devices. The product is scheduled to go on sale in the first quarter of 2005, the company said. One XtremeBlade chassis will accommodate up to 12 dual-processor blades, six four-processor blades, or three eight-processor blades. The design has built-in InfiniBand and Gigabit Ethernet high-speed networking switches and connections. Most clusters run Linux, but Microsoft is trying to break into the market. At the show Monday, the company demonstrated a forthcoming version of Windows called Windows Server 2003 Compute Cluster Edition. Itanium systems arrive Clusters aren't the only products to be announced Monday. Hewlett-Packard also plans to announce a new collection of lower-end servers in its Itanium 2-based Integrity line. The four-processor Integrity rx4640 now can be purchased with the new high-end Itanium 2 model, a product running at 1.6GHz and including 9MB of built-in high-speed cache memory. The previous high-end Itanium 2 had 6MB of memory and topped out at 1.5GHz. The faster Itanium processors won't reach HP's midrange and high-end Integrity products until early 2005. In addition, HP's dual-processor rx1620 is available with a new lower-end Itanium 2 running at 1.6GHz and including 3MB of cache. This processor includes a faster memory data pathway running at 533MHz instead of the 400MHz most Itanium 2 chips use. HP also is selling the dual-processor rx2620, a system that's more expandable than the rx1620 and has a thickness of 3.5 inches rather than 1.75 inches. All three servers are expected to go on sale in December and can run four operating systems: Linux, Windows, HP-UX and OpenVMS. Starting prices are $4,000 for the rx1620, $5,000 for the rx2620 and $15,000 for the rx4640. HP, the co-inventor of Itanium, is its most aggressive advocate, but others sell the processor as well. Silicon Graphics announced its new Itanium-based Altix 3700 Bx2 servers in October, and Unisys announced its model on Monday. Unisys' high-end ES7000 line can accommodate Intel's Itanium and Xeon processors--including both at the same time running software in separate partitions. Itanium-based models start at $39,500. The company has a new hybrid model, the ES7000 460, that can accommodate up to 32 Xeon and up to 16 Itanium 2 processors simultaneously.
2002-06-24 - New chip speeds HP Unix servers    Hewlett-Packard will speed up its top-end Superdome Unix server with a faster processor, ensuring further spicy competition with IBM and Sun Microsystems. The 64-processor Superdome server is on the vanguard of HP's effort to steal market share from Sun and stave off the growth of IBM in the Unix server market. It has used HP's PA-RISC 8700 processors running at 750MHz, but a new model now shipping is equipped with 875MHz 8700+ processors, HP will announce Monday. HP boasts that the new system has broken some performance records and will break more, including the TPC-C test from the Transaction Performance Council that measures how well a server handles reading and writing database information. HP, in third place, is sensitive to the test because one of its employees allegedly sabotaged the test. The Unix server market is the single largest segment of the server market, with systems that not only are powerful enough for jobs such as tracking corporate inventory but also that are cheaper to run than mainframes. However, the Unix server market shrank 18.7 percent from $25.3 billion in 2000 to $20.6 billion in 2001, according to analyst firm Gartner. Sun is the leader in the Unix server market, though HP leads in the midrange segment where systems cost between $100,000 and $1 million. Sun has been working to plug its midrange gaps, introducing its Sun Fire 12k "Starkitty" system in April. HP said the new Superdome models top the SpecJBB2000 test of performance running Java server programs with a score of 594,000 operations per second. IBM's p690 scored 339,000, and Sun's Sun Fire 15K scored 433,000, though an unconventionally configured 15K with more processors and less input-output capacity scored 602,000. Superdome also can accommodate Intel's Itanium family of processors, which HP developed before handing off to Intel to commercialize. In 2001, HP had planned to release Itanium Superdomes in the second half of 2002, but pushed back the Itanium models to early 2003. Two more generations of PA-RISC are still in the works as well. The 8800, which will squeeze two processors onto a single slice of silicon, will arrive in 2003 and the 8900 in 2004, after which all new models will use Itanium processors. HP will sell PA-RISC systems through 2006 and support them through 2011. HP's Superdome servers figure prominently on the Top 500 list of supercomputers, though not in the upper ranks. The supercomputing systems typically consist of several Superdomes joined in a configuration called "Hyperplex" that uses a high-speed switch from Myricom.
2002-11-04 - New chip powers high-end Intel servers Intel released three new Xeon chips for four- and eight-processor servers in a move to increase the pressure on Sun Microsystems. The new chips--formerly code-named Gallatin--are enhanced versions of Intel's Xeon line for multiprocessor servers. The fastest of the new chips runs at 2GHz and contains a 2MB tertiary cache, a reservoir of memory for rapid data access. The older Xeon, which came out in March, tops out at 1.6GHz and has a 1MB cache. "The performance speed-up is in the 20 (percent) to 38 percent range" on various applications, said Lisa Graff, director of enterprise processor marketing at Intel. "Cache (has) a huge impact on performance." IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer, among others, will adopt the chips fairly rapidly, as the new chips cost the same as the older Xeons and can fit into existing servers without a great deal of re-engineering. These servers start at $6,000 and can cost more than $100,000 when fully configured. The four- and eight-processor server market has become the primary battleground in the war between Sun and Intel. Servers made with Intel chips running Windows or Linux dominate the one- and two-processor segment. Servers running RISC (reduced instruction set computer) chips such as Sun's UltraSparc III, and Unix operating systems, though, still dominate the more lucrative parts of the market. RISC servers still account for 60 percent of server revenue worldwide, according to figures from research firm IDC, although they make up only 12 percent of units shipped. With the new Xeons, IBM and other companies say they can undercut and outperform Sun. Just as important, large organizations are increasingly willing to buy Intel-based machines for running large databases and other tasks historically allotted to RISC machines. "We're getting a lot of customers coming from Sun to Intel on the x440," said Doug Outhout, director of high-performance xSeries servers at IBM. The x440 is IBM's high-end Intel machine and is capable of running 16 chips at once. Sun could not be reached for comment. Still, it's going to be one long, slow war. Sun, IBM and HP, which also sell RISC-Unix servers, continue to enhance the performance of their 16- and 32- processor machines while improving the value proposition on the lower-end boxes. "The Unix market has really learned in the past year about doing things less expensively," Outhout said. Jeff Hewitt, an analyst at Gartner, said that, except for IBM's x440, which is experiencing growth, most of the new Intel systems would probably be bought to replace existing four- and eight-processor servers. A close count The Gallatin servers to some degree will also compete against servers running Intel's more expensive Itanium chip. Benchmark tests show that the difference between the Gallatin servers and current Itanium servers isn't huge. On the Transaction Performance Council's TPC-C benchmark, which counts transactions per second, the four-processor Gallatin box is currently only "a little bit underneath" a similar Itanium system, Intel's Graff said. "That's a real problem for Intel," Hewitt said. "Until the applications are there (for Itanium) and until the operating systems are there with all of the capabilities, you can probably do most of the things you want to do with the Xeon products." Graff said that the close performance between the current Gallatin systems and Itanium comes from the oscillating nature of the product releases. The last Itanium, Itanium 2, came out this summer. Madison, a new version of Itanium coming next year, will open the gap. "You will see the Itanium line consistently ahead of Xeon," Graff said. The Gallatin systems also handily beat published benchmarks from Sun. Opteron, AMD's server chip, could put pressure on Intel. "That has some significant benefits," IBM's Outhout said. "We think they have the opportunity to do some serious damage to Intel next year." IBM will use the new chip in the four-processor x255 server, which can be equipped with its own storage unit, the x360 for racks, and the x440. An eight-way x440 achieved a TPC-C benchmark of 111,024 transactions per second. The chip will displace the older chip over the next eight to 10 weeks, according to IBM. Dell, meanwhile, will start offering Gallatin in the PowerEdge 6600 and 6650 servers, a representative said. The line starts at $5,999. HP will offer the chip on the ProLiant ML570 and ProLiant DL760 servers. A fully configured ProLiant achieved a TPC-C score of 111,805, according to HP. Both IBM and HP will insert the chip into blade servers in 2003. Blades are far thinner than standard servers and can be managed more easily from a central location. The new chips run at 1.5GHz, 1.9GHz and 2GHz. The 1.5GHz and 1.9GHz models contain only 1MB of cache, while the 2GHz version contains 2MB. The chips are made on the 130-nanometer manufacturing process, while the older Xeons were made on the 180-nanometer process. The nanometer figure refers to the average size of features on the chip. Shrinking the chip allowed Intel to insert more cache, Graff said. The 1.5GHz version sells for $1,177 in 1,000-unit quantities, while the 1.9GHz and 2GHz versions sell, respectively, for $1,980 and $3,692.
2003-11-16 - New blood joins supercomputer ranking  The supercomputer gene pool has expanded. Of the top 10 systems on a list of the 500 most powerful supercomputers announced Sunday, three machines are new, one is upgraded, and two are based on processors that have never before appeared on the list: IBM's PowerPC 970 and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron. The IBM chips show up in a $5.2 million system officially named X but informally dubbed "Big Mac" that Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University researchers assembled over two months from 1,100 dual-processor Apple G5 computers. That system ranked No. 3 with a performance of 10.3 trillion calculations per second, or 10.3 teraflops. The Opterons are used in a 2,816-processor cluster built by Linux Networx for Los Alamos National Laboratory. Its sustained speed is 8 teraflops. The No. 1 and No. 2 systems--NEC's Earth Simulator and LANL's ASCI Q, built by Hewlett-Packard, maintained their positions with performance of 35.6 teraflops and 13.8 teraflops, respectively. Earth Simulator has held the top spot for four consecutive lists. The Top500 list is compiled by researchers at the University of Mannheim, the University of Tennessee and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The list, released twice each year on the eve of a supercomputing conference, shows the waxing and waning power of various manufacturers, the arrival of new technologies and the constantly increasing power of the world's number-crunching elite. The total performance of the top 500 systems has been increasing exponentially, growing by a factor of 10 about every four years. In 1993, the total performance was just over 1 teraflop; it reached 10 teraflops in 1997, 100 teraflops in 2001, and list compilers project it to cross the 1000 teraflop--or 1 petaflop--boundary in about 2005. Also according to the projections, a system must have about a 1-teraflop performance to make it on the list. Currently, 131 systems surpass that level. Machines on the system are ranked with a speed test called Linpack that involves solving linear equations. Looking beyond the coveted top spot, either HP or IBM has the strongest presence in the list, depending on which measurement is used. HP had the most systems on the list, 165 to IBM's 159--not much change from the 159-156 gap in June. But in terms of the fraction of the list's total computing power--530 teraflops--IBM was the leader with 35 percent to HP's 23 percent. That gap is nearly unchanged from June, when the percentages were 35 and 24 for the two companies. Intel's Xeon surpassed HP's PA-RISC to become the processor most often used, rising from 76 systems in June to 152 systems in November. PA-RISC declined from 128 to 114. Intel's high-end Itanium 2 processor grew from 19 systems to 32. IBM's Power4, meanwhile, dropped from 64 systems to 50. The U.S. government, alarmed by Japan's top ranking, has begun a program to spur new research. The government is funding IBM, Cray and Sun Microsystems to prototype new systems. U.S. officials, who long have placed controls on supercomputer exports to China, likely won't be encouraged by work in that country by Beijing-based Legend Group. Six months ago, the most powerful Chinese system was Legend's DeepComp 1800 at the Academy of Mathematics and System Science in China, a system with 512 of Intel's 2GHz Xeon processors that ranked No. 51 with a sustained speed of 1 teraflop. On the latest list, No. 14 is Legend's DeepComp 6800 at the Chinese Academy of Science, built from 1,024 of Intel's 1.3GHz Itanium 2 processors. Among other changes on the list: The first module of IBM's Blue Gene/L supercomputer placed 73rd with a sustained performance of 1.4 teraflops. When the full Blue Gene/L is completed in 2005, a system with 128 times as many processors as the current prototype, IBM expects performance of 360 teraflops, enough to top the list by a wide margin. At least three systems on the list are clusters of lower-end computers connected by the high-speed InfiniBand networking technology, including the No. 3 Apple Computer machine. The turnover rate on the list is "well above average," its compilers said in a statement. The pokiest system on the list, at 403 gigaflops, was No. 290 in June. Opteron systems also show up at Nos. 93, 116 and 247. Clusters of independent lower-end systems linked with a high-speed network continue to gain in importance. Such systems first appeared on the list in 1998 but now account for close to half its systems and total performance.

2003-04-23 - NEC Windows server wins speed test An NEC server with 32 of Intel's forthcoming Itanium 2 6M processors and running the Windows Server 2003 has secured the top spot in a widely watched performance measurement. The system, an NEC Express5800/1320Xc costing $5.9 million, displaced a 128-processor Unix server from Fujitsu that has been No. 1 since August 2001 on the Transaction Processing Performance Council's TPC-C test. The NEC system is the first Windows system to achieve the top spot, and also is the least expensive of the top 10 on the TPC-C list. But NEC's victory may not last long: Hewlett-Packard, a co-inventor and key supporter of Itanium, plans to announce its own speed results Thursday at the formal Windows Server 2003 launch in San Francisco, and sources expect it to beat NEC. In addition, IBM has been working on a new result using a forthcoming version of its 32-processor p690 Unix server with Power4 processors. The TPC-C test, perhaps the most widely watched measurement of server performance, simulates a warehouse control system, handling tasks such as placing purchase orders and tracking inventory. NEC's system performed 514,000 transactions per minute, compared with 456,000 for the Fujitsu system. However, the benchmark is considered imperfect because server makers can optimize their systems in ways that are impractical in the real world; Sun Microsystems refuses to submit TPC-C scores in part because it's not completely representative of actual performance. The NEC machine uses the third-generation "Madison" version of the Itanium processor family, a chip Intel plans to release later this year. The currently shipping version, Itanium 2 "McKinley," was the basis of the 32-processor NEC server that gave Windows a major boost on the TPC-C list when it arrived last September. The earlier NEC system helped support Microsoft's sales pitch that its software is good not only for lower-end servers but also for the "big iron" that runs corporations' most important computing jobs. Itanium 2 6M "Madison" has 6MB of high-speed cache memory compared to 3MB for the Itanium 2 "McKinley." In addition, Itanium 2 6M will run at a clock speed of 1.5GHz compared with 1GHz for Itanium 2. Intel has said it expects performance to increase 30 percent to 50 percent from Itanium 2 to Itanium 2 6M. NEC's newest score with the Itanium 2 6M is 19 percent better than NEC's earlier score of 433,000 transactions per minute with the Itanium 2. NEC is top of the heap right now, but HP has aggressive plans for Itanium. It will release 64-processor Superdome systems initially, then through a technology code-named Hondo that plugs two Itanium processors into a single socket, will sell 128-processor Itanium systems. HP supports three operating systems on its Itanium systems today--Windows, Linux and HP-UX Unix--and will add support for OpenVMS next year.
2003-06-20 - NEC plans server strategy changes  NEW YORK--A new executive at NEC has plans to overhaul the company's sales strategy to improve the success of crash-resistant servers it sells in the United States. Complete coverage Spotlight on CeBit Follow News.com?s coverageof the New York show. NEC sells an "ft" line of fault-tolerant servers that use redundant hardware components and carefully tested software to protect against many crashes. But soon those systems could be getting a new description, Larry Sheffield, senior vice president of marketing for NEC Solutions America, said at the CeBit America trade show here. "In the U.S., I'd like to re-brand it," Sheffield said. He said the new name likely will focus on "high availability," a server buzzword that refers to grouping servers so one system can take over if another fails. NEC's strategy accomplishes much the same idea, only with backup components such as spare processors taking over. For many customers, the "fault tolerant" concept has carried negative connotations of expense and complexity. In addition, the company will move from a direct sales strategy to one relying on a channel of indirect sales partners, Sheffield said. Those companies typically add software and services to make hardware more useful to their customers; NEC expects many of those partners to focus on servers for hosting Microsoft Exchange, file and print software. Sheffield also hopes to get more mileage out of existing relationships with Microsoft and Intel. And the company will try to encourage storage specialist Network Appliance, which buys fault-tolerant hardware from NEC for some products, to try to sell the NEC products alongside its own products. NEC plans to begin selling its high-end Itanium servers by October, said Rosie Dalomba, an NEC marketing manager. Fault-tolerant Itanium servers are scheduled to arrive in 2004, she said. Sheffield previously sold servers for SGI after a 28-year stint selling services and hard drives for IBM.
2003-02-20 - NEC Intel boast high server speed  An NEC server with 32 Intel Itanium processors and Microsoft's coming Server 2003 operating system has claimed the No. 2 place in the most widely watched server speed test. The $4.4 Reader Resources Overclocking guide TechRepublic million server posted a performance of 433,000 transactions per minute, a result faster than IBM's 32-processor p690, with 428,000 transactions per minute, and Hewlett-Packard's 64-processor Superdome with 423,000. Only Fujitsu's 128-processor Primepower 2000 has a higher result, 456,000. The TPC-C speed test, which simulates sales and inventory transactions on a database server, is the most widely watched measurement of server performance. However, analyst firm IDC advises against relying too heavily on TPC-C because the test has some loopholes and because extensive system tuning can lead to artificially high results. "What's impressive is that it's a Windows system, an Itanium system, and it's playing with the big boys," said Gordon Haff, an Illuminata analyst. "It's another proof point among many that Itanium 2 is right up there with (IBM's) Power4." Mike Fister, senior vice president of Intel's Enterprise Platforms Group, announced the results Thursday at the Intel Developer Forum in San Jose, Calif. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker is pushing its Itanium processor as a less-expensive alternative to high-end processors such as IBM's Power and Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc. Fister said the result should dispel doubts about the viability of the Itanium line and the merits of building computers using the chip. "No one has to feel worried and embarrassed about our intent to drive this stuff anymore," he said during a keynote speech Thursday. HP, which co-developed the Itanium line, is gradually moving its server line from its own PA-RISC processors to Itanium chips. It plans a cavalcade of new Itanium products this year, including eight-, 16- and 64-processor systems. Thursday's test result was foreshadowed by an earlier benchmark NEC published in September with a similar 32-processor server but with 256GB of memory instead of the 512GB in the new test. That result helped provide some substance to an argument by Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates that the company's software now is able to run on large-scale systems. NEC's tests used the first version of the Itanium 2 processor, code-named McKinley. Intel plans to release a faster Itanium 2 later this year code-named Madison and a successor called Madison 9M in 2004. News.com's Michael Kanellos contributed to this report.
2003-05-13 - NEC customer finds Itanium 2 glitch    An NEC customer uncovered the Itanium 2 glitch that Intel announced on Monday. NEC brought the matter to Intel's attention, said Mike Mitsch, senior director of server solutions for NEC America. The customer, whom Mitch declined to specifically identify but said is a Japanese company, found the problem "relatively recently," while the server was still undergoing testing. The glitch in the chip maker's flagship processor is a circuitry problem that can cause computers with either the 900MHz or 1GHz Itanium 2 processors to behave erratically or crash. Intel developed a process to screen for the problem during manufacturing and has a separate software package that computer makers can use. In the meantime, people can sidestep the issue by setting the Itanium 2 to run at a slower 800MHz speed. The coming 1.5GHz Itanium 2 6M, expected this summer, isn't affected, Intel said. NEC, like Hewlett-Packard, SGI and Unisys, is screening for the problem before shipping new systems. IBM, on the other hand, has halted shipments of the x450, Big Blue's first serious foray into the Itanium market. Dell Computer, which won't sell Itanium servers until it releases an Itanium 2 6M-based product in the second half of the year, said it's not affected. Intel has done well first with Pentium and then with Xeon processors for use in lower-end servers, but the Itanium family is Intel's ambitious attempt to penetrate the upper echelons of the market currently dominated by IBM, Sun Microsystems and HP. Their servers can cost millions of dollars and are entrusted with their customers' most precious data. Monday's glitch announcement was the latest of a series of black marks on the chip family's record, along with several delays and the poor performance of the first-generation Itanium, code-named Merced. But beginning with Itanium 2, the processor family has met many of Intel's hopes. Several computer makers are using the processor in powerful designs--including a 128-processor behemoth planned at HP--and the Itanium 2 has shown good performance. And with new software called the IA-32 Execution Layer coming later this year, Intel hopes to ease problems that the chip has running software that's written for Pentium and Xeon. The Itanium 2 electrical glitch announced Monday isn't as serious as it could have been, said Mercury Research analyst Dean McCarron. Certainly, a server processor that has reliability issues is of great concern, McCarron said, "since servers aren't supposed to make mistakes, but the actual number of systems affected is going to be tiny compared to the more traditional server market based on Xeon."
2004-01-06 - MySQL database coming to Itanium 2 MySQL on Tuesday released a version of its popular open-source database which will run on high-end servers from Hewlett Packard. The company updated the MySQL 4.0 software with the ability to run on the HP-UX 11i Unix operating system and Linux on servers equipped with Intel's 64-bit Itanium 2 processor. MySQL also said that its MySQL 4.1--the current version of the database for software development purposes--will run on the Windows operating system on Itanium 2-based systems. Version 4.1 can be used by developers but is not yet ready to be used in finished applications, the company said. MySQL gives away its namesake database and makes money by providing support services for the software. The company, in general, has pitched its database as a cheaper and functional alternative to commercial databases for relatively straightforward data-handling tasks. Get Up to Speed on... Open source Get the latest headlines andcompany-specific news in ourexpanded GUTS section. Versions of MySQL running on Itanium 2-based servers will allow developers to use the open-source database for more complex and demanding computing jobs, according to the company. The 64-bit processors are designed for more data-intensive applications. Over the past year, developers have substantially stepped up usage of the MySQL open-source database, according to a survey published Monday by Evans Data. Although Microsoft's SQL Server database remains the top development database, the study concluded that programmers showed a growing interest in the cost-effectiveness and reliability of open-source databases. Developers can download MySQL 4.0 and MySQL 4.1 from the company's Web site.
2009-06-01 - Multi-threading reviewed   I've been getting a fair number of questions about multi-threading the past couple of weeks. The reason is that Intel has been previewing its "Nehalem EX" Xeon processor in advance of Advanced Micro Device's six-core "Istanbul" CPU launch. Intel's Nehalem generation has simultaneous multi-threading (SMT)--which Intel calls Hyper-Threading (HT)--while Istanbul does not. I wrote about this topic in depth a couple of years back in "Gradations of Threading," but it's worth reviewing in the context of these new server processors. First, a little terminology. A thread is a sequence of instructions that can execute in parallel with other threads. The details of what exactly constitutes a thread and the relationship between threads and other structures such as processes vary by operating system. However, for our purposes here, think of a thread as an independent task. Simultaneous multi-threading. Illuminata A core is, in most respects, a complete processor that includes all the hardware such as execution units, registers, and so forth required to execute a sequence of instructions. Although multiple cores on a single die or in a single package (i.e. a chip or socket) may share certain resources such as cache memories, logically each core is a full central processing unit (CPU). That multiple cores are packaged together today is essentially an implementation detail that relates to getting the best performance out of the most economically sized silicon die. Absent multithreading, each core can execute one thread at a time, running that thread until it has completed or until the operating system scheduler swaps it out for another thread. SMT changes that 1:1 relationship. On a processor with SMT, more than one thread can execute on a single core at the same time--in the case of HT, it's two threads per core. SMT potentially allows a processor to be more efficiently utilized. The reason is that modern microprocessors have multiple execution units within each core. For example, they have separate logic to handle integer operations and floating-point operations. Thus, in principle, if a thread with mostly integer operations runs concurrently with a thread that mostly crunches floating-point numbers, we could keep the processor busier by running both threads at the same time than we could running them sequentially. The other main benefit is to hide memory latency. CPUs have to operate on data and that data has to ultimately come from memory or disk. Computer designs incorporate all sorts of techniques--such as caches and prefetching--to keep data close to processors in time and space. Nonetheless, processors still spend a lot of time waiting for data to arrive from relatively pokey memory. SMT lets a CPU quickly switch away from a thread that's sitting idle waiting for associated data to arrive. SMT is therefore essentially a technique to use a processor more efficiently. It does not itself add execution resources to a core. And, in fact, the duplicated hardware and other logic that SMT requires to function (such as registers) takes space away from implementing other features (such as larger caches) that could themselves provide alternative ways to boost chip performance. Intel's HT implementation--a fairly "lightweight" approach relative to IBM's on its Power processor--uses on the order of 5 percent of the total chip area to deliver typical performance gains of between 10 and 20 percent. (Optimized applications can see bigger gains. On the other hand, applications that are already efficiently using the CPU's execution units--or that are bottlenecked in ways that SMT can't assist with--may see no gain at all.) Ultimately SMT is just one performance feature among many that may or may not be a match for a given processor's design. In Intel's case, it's been in some x86 designs but not others since it debuted on the Pentium 4; Itanium uses a simpler Temporal multi-threading approach. SMT's in the plus column of the features checklist. But what really matters is overall processor performance on relevant workloads and platform capabilities. SMT is one tool to get there.
2006-07-19 - Moving on with Montecito   SAN FRANCISCO--Intel has had some rocky times bringing Itanium to market, but Pat Gelsinger believes the company is over the hump. Gelsinger, general manager of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group, has no shortage of bullish predictions that Itanium has now caught on. "We will look back at this as the inflection point of the platform," he said in an interview at Intel's launch event for Itanium 2, code-named Montecito, here Tuesday. Montecito arrived well after the 2005 launch date Intel had envisioned, but it is unquestionably an improvement over its predecessors. It has double the performance and yet consumes 20 percent less electrical power. Much of the performance boost is from the use of dual processing engines, a feature already present when IBM introduced Power4 in 2001 and Sun Microsystems introduced UltraSparc IV in 2004. Video: Intel launches Montecito Itanium CNET News.com's Stephen Shankland talks with Pat Gelsinger about Intel's hopes for the dual core chip. Gelsinger is responsible for improving not just Itanium technology, but also its image. The chip family's debut five years ago was beset by performance problems, delays and software incompatibility with mainstream chips. More recent ignominy included decisions by Dell and IBM to drop Itanium servers. Gelsinger, a veteran Intel employee, is undaunted. He's risen through the ranks since joining Intel in 1979, and has held titles such as 80486 processor chief architect and, more recently, chief technology officer. He sat down with CNET News.com's Stephen Shankland at the launch event. Q: Intel today launched the Montecito processor version of its Itanium 2 processor family. What's important about the Montecito launch? Gelsinger: This is the exciting announcement of the dual-core, 1.7 billion-transistor, multithreaded, virtualized, secure, reliable processor. What we're trying to do with the Itanium family is position it as the unquestioned solution for the mission-critical computing. We are joined by eight OEMs (original equipment manufacturers, a term used to describe computer makers) announcing systems to go with it. We continue to build our ISV (independent software vendor) momentum. There now are over 8,000 applications on Itanium. You described Montecito as an "inflection point." Why is that? Gelsinger: There are a couple aspects to today's announcement. We've had to labor to build a new architecture. Today, it's unquestionably at critical mass, with eight OEMs shipping it. We have the operating systems available for it, the applications momentum around it, the Itanium Solutions Alliance. It's credible. We posted incredibly good benchmarks. And we're seeing it's up and to the right: Systems revenue is growing very consistently, over the last couple of years. We're now half the size of the rivals we're aiming at, Power and Sparc. Clearly, we've gotten to the point where this thing is gaining momentum. There was pent-up demand for Montecito. It's a socket drop-in: It drops right into the Madison (Itanium) systems today, so customers immediately can start to take advantage of this great new technology. It wasn't all smooth sailing, though. In October last year, you announced a delay. You initially wanted to launch Montecito in 2005, but you started shipping it in June 2006, and servers with it won't generally be available until September. What happened in that delay, and what was its effect? Gelsinger: We were embarrassed by the delay, of course. We're a microprocessor company. We should be able to deliver these things when we say we are. Unfortunately, we hit some difficult spots, so we announced the delay last year. Since then, we've executed exactly against what we said we would. I'm pretty proud of that. The team has worked pretty hard to get to this point. Secondly, there are customers. They were anxious. They were ready to go. They had the sockets, the systems ready to go. There really is some of that pent-up enthusiasm for it. Thirdly, we had to convince the industry: "Yes, wait, this thing really is great." Now that they've begun seeing it, and (Intel has begun) seeding it with customers and the ISVs, they're saying, "Wow, this is really a breakthrough platform." They are really embracing it in a quite aggressive way. As we see the system announcements from the OEMs over the next 30 to 90 days, I think you're going to see some really exciting stuff. A few weeks ago, you launched a new Xeon processor, the Woodcrest model, which is a pretty big redesign. In the scheme of things, which is more important for you, Woodcrest or Montecito? Gelsinger: Yes. No, come on! One or the other. Gelsinger: It's really two different markets. In terms of the revenue impact, the Xeon family is a much bigger near-term revenue impact for Intel, so that's really big and important for us, and it's why we put a lot of emphasis on that announcement. But the market is really almost cut in half, as you think about the market for servers. About half of it is volume servers where Xeon is king. Then you have the back-end data center, mission-critical machines which are about $25 billion as well. That's the space of the big mainframes, the big iron. The volumes are much lower, but the system prices are much higher. That's where Itanium is the target. Is the Itanium business meeting your financial goals? Gelsinger: Our goals are to grow it. We've labored to get the platform to critical mass, as we believe it is now, and we've seen the systems revenue really start to take off. It's not yet to the level of profitability that we hope to see in it, but we are very encouraged by the strong demand, and we are ahead of our forecast for the product line this year.
2004-08-16 - Motorola and HP in Linux tie-up    Motorola plans to sell mobile phone network equipment that uses Linux-based code, a step forward in network gear makers' efforts to rally around a standard. The company on Monday said it will sell Hewlett-Packard's Integrity cx2600 server and a carrier-grade version of the Linux operating system that's meant to handle the stresses of a next-generation cell phone network. The hardware and software package will be designed for operators that use either the IDEN (Integrated Dispatch Enhanced Network) cell phone standard, such as Nextel Communications, or the more popular CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) standard, used in the United States by Verizon Wireless and Sprint. Joy King, director of worldwide marketing for HP's network and service provider business unit, believes that Linux is evolving into the standard to use. While Motorola isn't ready to dump its own software just yet, she said, through this partnership, it has started down that path. "This is the first real carrier-grade open-source software implementation in the heart of the call path," King said. "Motorola and others have traditionally used their own homegrown software, and it was so expensive it could only be targeted at top-tier carriers. For years, major network equipment makers have tried to shed the software each developed separately to power their network equipment in favor of a unified standard. The idea is simple: Network equipment makers agree on the same basic building blocks for the switches, routers and other equipment they make, then add their own improvements from there. By using the same basic ingredients, they spend 20 percent less on building the gear, because they won't have to develop every piece in-house. The savings can be passed on to the telephone company and, eventually, to its customers. Major equipment vendors, including Nortel Networks, Nokia, Lucent Technologies and Ericsson, are also going in this direction, according to analysts. Motorola said it plans to start selling the new equipment in the next 12 to 18 months. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. As part of the partnership, Motorola will sell HP's OpenCall Radio Signaling Controller software, which will be used in the core of cell phone networks to set up calls. The HP Integrity cx2600 server that Motorola will use is based on Intel's Itanium processor, signaling that there's life left in the chipmaker's hard-luck product line. Intel has spent more than a billion dollars in the past decade on chip development, server designs, venture investments and software to create a full-fledged environment for Itanium. Computers containing the chip rank among the fastest machines in the world, and sales have substantially improved in the past 18 months. Still, Itanium holds only a fraction of the market, and analysts and competitors often assert that it will remain a niche product. CNET News.com's Michael Kanellos contributed to this report.

2006-07-19 - Montecito servers expected in September    SAN FRANCISCO--Intel has begun selling its dual-core "Montecito" version of Itanium. Next up: a slew of servers using the high-end processor. Hewlett-Packard, Unisys, Silicon Graphics, Fujitsu and NEC described plans for new Montecito-based servers at the chip launch event Tuesday. Most servers will arrive in September. HP, which initiated the Itanium project and co-developed initial models with Intel, is by far the dominant Itanium server company. But Pat Gelsinger, general manager of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group, expects the market to even out. "We expect the percentage will become greater for the other vendors going forward," Gelsinger said. Whether that actually happens is a key barometer of whether Itanium is merely a replacement for HP's own server chips or, as Intel hopes, a broader market force that pressures IBM and Sun Microsystems' processor families more directly. HP and Intel announced their chip collaboration in 1994, but the Itanium program has been fraught with delays and other troubles, including a Montecito delay in 2005. And though Dell and IBM dropped their Itanium servers, Itanium systems are encroaching on rivals' market share. "I think we've hit critical mass," Gelsinger said. Because the Montecito uses the same electrical connections as its predecessor, the "Madison 9M" Itanium, it can be dropped into the same servers. As a bonus, it consumes less power--104 watts maximum compared with 130--which means engineers don't have to worry about the common problem of overheating from a chip upgrade. However, Montecito's dual processing cores have a greater appetite for data, and many server companies have chosen to design new servers around the chips. Although Unisys and Fujitsu are just upgrading the processor, HP, SGI and NEC built new machines for Montecito, company representatives have said. The Montecito-Madison compatibility proved to be an advantage for HP and SGI, which had Montecito systems ready to go months ago. When Montecito was delayed, they introduced their new products with Madison chips. Among the Montecito systems executives described at the launch event are the following: NEC is releasing two Express5800 models, the 32-processor 1320Xf and eight-processor 1080Rf, which run Windows or Linux. The systems feature internal communication technologies that keep the cache memories of many chips synchronized so they can fetch data faster and more effectively, said Mike Mitsch, general manager of NEC's alliances and strategy. HP will bring Montecito to its entire Integrity line, starting with lower-end machines and then later bringing it to the high-end Superdome products. HP doesn't plan any upgrade promotions, said Brian Cox, director of marketing for HP's Business-Critical Server group. Unisys will upgrade its ES7000 servers with Montecito-based models shipping in early September. The Montecito systems will cost roughly the same as previous Madison versions but will have twice the performance per chip, said Chas Weber, Unisys' director of enterprise server market development. SGI, which specializes in technical computing rather than business tasks, is using Montecito in its Altix 4700 and 450 machines, said Jill Matzke, SGI's marketing manager for high-performance computing. Raytheon is an early customer, buying two 384-processor Altix 4700 systems and one 512-processor system. Fujitsu announced three Montecito servers, the Primequest 580 with up to 32 processors, the 540 with up to 16 processors and the 520 with up to eight processors.
2006-07-18 - Montecito broadens Fujitsu Itanium line    Fujitsu is revamping its server line with Intel's dual-core "Montecito" version of the Itanium 2 processor, upgrading two high-end models and introducing a third, midrange system. The Japanese server seller, which ranks fifth in global market share, began a partnership with Intel in 2003 to build its own Itanium-based servers. The systems, which incorporate technologies from Fujitsu's mainframe family, are emblematic of the high-end server push that has replaced Intel's once-broader Itanium ambitions. Fujitsu launched its first Itanium-based machines--the 16-processor Primequest 440 and 32-processor 480--in 2005. With the Montecito chip, Fujitsu is upgrading the machines into the 540 and 580 and expanding the North American family members with the eight-processor Primequest 520, said Richard McCormack, senior vice president of marketing for Fujitsu Computer Systems, the company's North American subsidiary. "A dual-core, eight-socket platform addresses a huge section of the market," McCormack said. All the systems will be available in September, the company said. It didn't release prices for the new Primequest models. Fujitsu's announcement of the systems is happening on Tuesday in conjunction with Intel's debut of six Montecito models, formally called the 9000 series of the Itanium 2 family. The chips, though arriving late, now will carry the weight of Intel's attempt to make them as widespread in powerful high-end servers as its Xeon is in lower-end machines. Fujitsu has years of experience designing powerful, reliable servers through its Amdahl mainframe line. But it's not just working to bring that technology to Primequest. It also has a Primepower line using its own Sparc64 processors and running Sun Microsystems' Solaris operating system. A new generation of Sparc-based systems, called the Advanced Product Line and jointly designed by Sun, are scheduled to go on sale starting this year.
2003-02-19 - Military drafts SGI for 26 million deal    SGI has won a $26 million contract to supply the U.S. Defense Department with high-end technical computing machines, software and services over the next 42 months, the company said Tuesday. The Defense Department is purchasing the products and services through its High Performance Computing Modernization Program, which aims to give the United States technological supremacy in weapons design and on the battlefield. The deal is a boost for SGI, a maker of high-end systems for technical tasks that has been struggling to recover after a failed expansion into the general-purpose server market. News of the sale helped lift the company's shares 14 percent at $1.28 on Tuesday. Selling products to government customers, particularly to those in the military, has been a mainstay of SGI's business for years. Part of the Mountain View, Calif.-based company's plan for the future hinges on new high-end Altix machines using Intel's Itanium processor and running the Linux operating system. Most SGI systems today use the company's own MIPS processor and Irix operating system. The Defense Department is sticking with the MIPS-Irix models. The systems it's purchasing include the flagship Origin 3000 supercomputers, the Onyx 3000 variant for graphics-intensive applications, Origin 300 midrange machines, Total Performance 9500 high-end storage systems, and SGI's CXFS file system software. Four defense sites will use the computers, SGI said. In particular, the Aeronautical Systems Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio will benefit from the new purchases by installing four 512-processor Origin 3000 systems, two 64-processor Origin 3000s, a 12-processor Origin 3000, and two four-processor Origin 300 systems. In addition, the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center in Monterey, Calif., will work on improving its computer models of the ocean and atmosphere with a 256-processor Origin 3000. Also, the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center in Vicksburg, Miss., will install two 512-processor Origin 3000 machines.
2005-04-11 - Microsoft uses Longhorn to promote Itanium Microsoft has committed to selling an Itanium edition of its forthcoming Longhorn Server, part of a renewed marketing effort for Windows on the high-end processor that Intel and Microsoft plan to begin Monday. The vast majority of Windows operating systems run on mainstream x86 processors such as Intel's Xeon or Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron. Because Itanium is largely incompatible and not nearly as widely used, support for it has been a lower priority for Microsoft. That's starting to change, as Microsoft comes around to the way Intel and its chief Itanium ally, Hewlett-Packard, see the world. Like them, Microsoft wants to use Itanium to tackle the "big iron" part of the server market--massive multiprocessor machines running demanding and crucial tasks. "Our position has not been as clear here as much as it should be," Bob Muglia, senior vice president of the Windows Server Division, said in an interview. "We have a commitment to Xeon, but also very much to Itanium." Part of that commitment involves releasing Longhorn Server for the processor in 2007, Muglia said, which is the same year the x86 version is expected. Another part is a multicity tour called Route64 to tout advantages of 64-bit processing. Another part of Microsoft's commitment will be buying 1,600 Itanium servers from HP. "I would say it's the most positive that we've been, ever really, since the start of Itanium," said Rich Marcello, senior vice president of HP's Business Critical Server group. By comparison, the Itanium agenda earlier hadn't even included discussions with Microsoft about Longhorn Server, Marcello said. "We had not gotten around to the conversation," he said. Itanium has 64-bit extensions that permit the processor to easily use more than 4GB of memory. That feature appeals to Scott Erkonen, managing officer of networking at Premier Bank Card, who runs business-intelligence tasks on an HP Integrity server with 12 Itanium processors and 24GB of memory. Until upgrading an earlier Xeon system to an Itanium machine, the company was having trouble keeping up with demands in loading, processing and extracting useful information, he said. Itanium's 64-bit nature isn't as much of a differentiation now that Xeon and Opteron have become available with the 64-bit extensions. Microsoft and Intel plan to include these newer x86 models in their promotional activities, too. For example, the companies plan to publish information on Monday that they say shows that many programs get a boost with an imminent 64-bit version of Windows for x86 chips. For example, a copy of SAP's business software can accommodate 18 percent more users, and Microsoft's Active Directory software for tracking computer users and privileges works twice as fast, according to the information. Microsoft also has a suite of 64-bit server programs planned for 2005 and 2006. Trials and travails Microsoft has long yearned for the plump profits and prestigious customers of the big iron market, but it's been tough convincing them that Microsoft has what it takes to run servers that must stay up and running without fail. "Our traditional partner channels and Microsoft don't have the experience base working with the customers who have that set of needs," Muglia said. Microsoft has some incentive to push Windows on Itanium: competition with Linux. Fujitsu announced new 32-processor Itanium servers last week--but for customer demand reasons, it's releasing models with Linux first in June, with Windows support to follow in September. Intel, too has had its hardships. It missed its 2004 Itanium shipment goal, but things are looking up now, said Abhi Talkwalkar, senior vice president of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group. "Our first quarter was very strong as it pertains to Itanium," he said. And the chipmaker is eagerly awaiting the release of Montecito models at the end of 2005. And even with a substantial Montecito performance boost showing up in new systems such as HP's Arches-based servers, some are still skeptical. Itanium arrived years late, IBM has cooled its support, and Intel has had trouble drumming up customers even with today's much less ambitious Itanium goals. Itanium so far has been most successful as a replacement for HP's PA-RISC chips, which run its HP-UX version of Unix. HP's Itanium-based Integrity systems are chiefly used to run HP-UX, the company said, with only about 18 percent of shipments used with Windows and 12 percent with Linux. Microsoft in 2004 canceled a workstation version of Windows for Itanium after HP canceled its workstation. But the companies now believe they've found their niche in specific high-end markets such as financial services and manufacturing that can make use of Microsoft's SQL Server database software. Microsoft plans Itanium versions of SQL Server 2005, its .Net Framework 2005 and Visual Studio 2005, but not much else. The company is trying to encourage Itanium support from other software companies, though. "What we expect to see over the next 12 to 24 months is a set of really critical customer applications moving onto Windows and the Itanium platform," Muglia said. HP expects Microsoft might expand its own software in the future, though. "The next logical thing to get on Integrity would be an Exchange implementation. I think that will be coming sometime down the road," Marcello said.
2003-05-19 - Microsoft to license SCO's Unix code   The software maker's agreement to license Unix lends weight to SCO Group's legal claims of copyright violation and helps Microsoft do battle with Linux. Sun and Oracle talk SCO, Unix licensingScott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems, with Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle Microsoft sends message with Unix deal news analysis A licensing deal with the SCO Group lends heavyweight backing to Unix intellectual property claims, and helps Microsoft combat Linux, a growing threat. May 19, 2003 SCO to license Unix code to Microsoft The software giant will license the rights to Unix technology from SCO Group, a move that could dramatically affect the battle between the Windows and Linux operating systems. May 18, 2003 Sun, HP not threatened The companies say SCO Group's attempt to obtain royalties for Unix won't likely affect them, while Red Hat says it will defend itself against any challenges. May 19, 2003 The case against Linux Unix owner SCO's $1 billion lawsuit against IBM provides a glimpse of what claims the company might make if it takes legal action against Linux users or distributors. May 19, 2003 The FUD war against Linux perspectives Open-source activist Bruce Perens uncovers the SCO-Microsoft connection behind a campaign to convince users that trade secrets of Unix have been copied into Linux. May 19, 2003 PeopleSoft sees .Net as IT 'asbestos' CEO Craig Conway says the company is porting all of its applications to Linux because alternative operating systems are the answer to the Microsoft's "death grip." May 19, 2003 SuSE: SCO's Linux claims are 'curious' The German company says it will keep backing the UnitedLinux code base despite SCO's intellectual-property claims on Linux, as Red Hat and MandrakeSoft shrug off the matter. May 15, 2003 SCO targets Linux customers About 1,500 of the world's largest corporations are warned they could be liable for using Linux. May 14, 2003 SuSE sheltered by pact An agreement with SCO Group protects Linux seller SuSE from legal action stemming from SCO's accusation that Unix software was copied into Linux, SuSE says. May 4, 2003 SCO: Unix code copied into LinuxSCO Group says copyrighted code has made its way into Linux, the popular open-source OS. If true, the open-source community could find its hard-won gains threatened. May 1, 2003 SCO sues Big Blue over Unix, LinuxSCO Group, inheritor of the intellectual property for the Unix operating system, sues IBM for more than $1 billion. Analysts say the move is a desperate one. March 6, 2003 FAQ on Unix, SCO and Microsoft By Scott Ard The computing landscape was jolted late Sunday with the announcement that Microsoft will be licensing Unix from SCO. These are some questions and answers to help sort out the significance of the pact. Why is Microsoft's decision to license Unix from SCO Group so important? Many companies defend their intellectual property and seek licensing fees, but not all are successful. Getting a large and influential company such as Microsoft to license Unix may lead others to follow. So, SCO gets some additional revenue. What's the news? In this case, the impact goes well beyond a few dollars changing hands. Microsoft considers Linux to be a major threat, because it is freely available and it has legions of developers actively improving it. By agreeing to license Unix, Microsoft is sending the message that SCO's copyright claims have merit. How will this move affect customers? That's the key question. Microsoft's move will likely force information technology managers to think twice about using Linux until the legal questions are sorted out. For example, if a large company has decided to adopt Linux partially because of its low cost, the possibility that it will now have to pay royalties could upset that equation. Fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) are certainly at work here. So, even if SCO's licensing demands later prove to be baseless, Microsoft could still reap the rewards of an unsettled market? Yes. How did SCO acquire the Unix code? The history of Unix is long and twisted. It was invented more than 30 years ago by AT&T's Unix Systems Laboratories. AT&T later sold the Unix intellectual property to Novell, which in turn sold it to the Santa Cruz Operation. Caldera International, a seller of Linux, then acquired from SCO the Unix rights and two SCO products, OpenServer and UnixWare. Last year, Caldera changed its name to SCO Group to reflect the fact that most of its revenue came from its SCO business and not from the Linux products. What makes SCO so certain that parts of Unix have been incorporated into Linux? SCO says it hired several consultants to compare the source codes of the two operating systems, and claims that bits of Unix have been essentially copied and pasted into Linux. The company which hasn't yet detailed its findings, says it will keep the evidence under wraps until the case with IBM reaches open court. Why attack IBM? Big Blue has been a major backer of Linux, having poured an estimated $1 billion into an effort to promote its use by major corporations and governments. By singling out IBM, SCO can focus its legal energies on a single foe--and if it's victorious, other companies will likely tumble like dominoes. SCO also has a relationship with IBM that sets it apart from other Linux distributors. The two were involved in a failed partnership called Project Monterey under which IBM, SCO and now-extinct Sequent agreed to create a version of Unix for Intel's Itanium processors. SCO shared expertise with IBM about how best to run Unix on Intel processors for that project, according to its suit. When did SCO decide to pursue this strategy? This is the basic chronology: SCO in January announced SCOsource, a strategy to more aggressively seek licensing revenue from the Unix intellectual property that the company owns. In March it filed suit against IBM, and last week SCO sent letters to hundreds of corporations warning them that their use of Linux may infringe on SCO's intellectual property. What's next? Look for other companies to follow Microsoft's actions and for feedback from major IT buyers about whether their plans for Linux are being reviewed. As for IBM, SCO has threatened to revoke Big Blue's Unix license, starting June 13. CNET News.com's Stephen Shankland contributed to this report.
2001-08-28 - Microsoft shines light on 64-bit Windows   Microsoft on Tuesday opened the door to 64-bit Windows. The company announced that its Windows Advanced Server, Limited Edition, is now available for computers based on Intel's 64-bit Itanium chip. Microsoft said that Compaq Computer, Dell Computer, Hewlett-Packard and IBM will start shipping servers running the new operating system within 30 days. Other computer makers will ship it later this year. The Itanium chip, aimed at heavy-duty workstations and servers for businesses and engineering, supports greater amounts of system memory and offers stronger floating-point, or mathematical, capabilities than current 32-bit desktop processors. The extra memory support and the floating-point capabilities serve to increase the performance of applications including Web hosting, data warehousing, computer-aided design and scientific research. The 64-bit version of Windows, based on Windows 2000, joins several other 64-bit operating systems ported to Itanium, including several Linux releases. Microsoft is also working on 64-bit versions of its Windows XP operating system. The new XP-based 64-bit OSes, one each for workstations and servers, are due next year. "Itanium-based servers combined with Microsoft's latest server software offer customers superior performance, greater choice, reliability and investment protection at significantly lower costs than proprietary solutions," Abhi Talwalkar, vice president and assistant general manager, Intel Enterprise Platforms Group, said in a prepared statement.
2002-09-05 - Microsoft SAP push Itanium software    Microsoft and business software giant SAP plan to offer prototype versions of their software to work with Hewlett-Packard servers using Intel's new Itanium 2 processor, the companies said Thursday. The cooperative program, which begins this month, is geared to encourage customers to adopt the new software and hardware. Programs such as SAP's R/3 accounting and inventory management software or Microsoft's .Net Server 2003 operating system must be overhauled to take advantage of the Itanium family of processors, which work very differently from Intel's Pentium and Xeon products.
2000-07-12 - Microsoft ready to send 64-bit Windows 2000 to developers  Microsoft has completed a near-final version of its 64-bit edition of Windows 2000 that will be sent to all software developers with Itanium prototype computers, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said today. The new "preview" version Gartner analyst Neil MacDonald says most businesses will greet the latest beta of Microsoft's 64-bit version of Windows 2000 with little interest. see commentary  of 64-bit Windows 2000 is a necessary step along the road to bringing a Windows operating system to computers based on Intel's next-generation Itanium chips. Intel and Microsoft see the new computers as a way to divert revenue--and fat profits--from Sun Microsystems and other manufacturers of high-end Unix servers. Although the preview release represents a milestone, the company's server strategy is far from seamless. The Datacenter version of Windows 2000, a beefed-up version of 32-bit Windows 2000 for servers, remains noticeably absent. This version, about a month late, was due four months after the Windows 2000 debut. Two final versions of 64-bit Windows, one for servers and one for workstations, will be released when computer manufacturers begin selling their systems, said Michael Stephenson, lead product manager for the Windows enterprise server division. The first Itanium processors, which will run at 800 MHz, are expected in the next few months. Computers incorporating the chip may appear toward the end of the year, according to several sources. Today's version is "about 95 percent feature-complete," Stephenson said. It's similar in technological maturity to a beta version, though Microsoft is avoiding the term "beta" to describe the software unfurled today. Even when production versions arrive, 64-bit Windows isn't expected to have an immediate effect, said Summit Strategies analyst Dwight Davis. "My gut sense is that it's going to be (for) pilot kinds of programs, and there won't be significant volumes through this year. "Ultimately, there will be more near-term demand for the 32-bit version of Datacenter than for the 64-bit Windows, which obviously will grow in sync with the 64-bit Intel platform," Davis said. Gates, speaking at the Windows Professional Developer Conference in Orlando, Fla., also said updated programming tools are available for those writing low-level and high-level software. And Microsoft is making 10 Itanium systems available to programmers who don't have the new computers but who need to test their codes remotely. The preview edition will be sent to those running the 5,000 Itanium prototypes Intel has sent, said Ron Curry, director of IA-64 marketing for Intel. Analysts and computer companies agree the biggest market that the 64-bit technology will open is the use of massive databases. That's because 32-bit systems can talk to relatively small amounts of memory--4 gigabytes--whereas 64-bit systems can keep vast amounts of information at hand. 64-bit vs. 32-bit chip? A 64-bit chip:Allows computers to incorporate vastly more memory than the 4-gigabyte limit imposed by 32-bit chips.Provides substantial performance improvement because information can be transferred in 64-bit, rather than 32-bit, parcels.Can run software such as complex databases that typically require huge amounts of memory and can manage higher-precision mathematical calculations. Customers who need to use large, fast databases today often purchase computers from Sun, IBM, Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard or SGI, all of which have a 64-bit version of Unix that runs on their own 64-bit chip. In the first three months of this year, $6.6 billion worth of these Unix servers were sold, according to market research firm International Data Corp. Intel is backing three operating systems for mainstream use on Itanium machines and the successors in the IA-64 family: Windows, Linux and a hybrid of three versions of Unix called Monterey-64, spearheaded by IBM and Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), among others. Boosting Linux on Itanium has been a novel experience for Intel because the Unix clone is produced by a loosely organized band of programmers. Intel has been helping by offering some programmers sneak peeks at the new architectures, a fact that will enable Linux for the first time to be ready when the new chips arrive, instead of trickling out months later. The earliest version of Linux for Itanium was released in February. TurboLinux, followed by Red Hat, released a complete prototype distribution of the heart of Linux along with other necessary components. VA Linux Systems has made test servers available for remote debugging. And last month, HP released software that allows people with today's 32-bit systems to test whether their 64-bit Itanium software works. The initial versions of 64-bit Windows were developed on Compaq's Alpha chips, but the effort has moved completely to Itanium chips, Stephenson said. Compaq abandoned plans for Windows on its 64-bit Alpha chips last year.
2004-02-03 - Microsoft picks new fight with Linux IBM   Microsoft is moving to a new phase in its competitive attack, arguing that the company is better than IBM and Linux when it comes to connecting different applications. The Redmond, Wash.-based software colossus had been contending, through a series of Get Up to Speed on... Open source Get the latest headlines andcompany-specific news in ourexpanded GUTS section. Microsoft-funded studies and "Get the Facts" advertisements, that Microsoft products have a lower "total cost of ownership" than Linux and other open-source software. Now Microsoft is trying to move the debate to the challenge of interoperability. Where the first target of the Get the Facts attack was Linux, the interoperability phase also puts IBM in the crosshairs. In an interview Tuesday, Martin Taylor, Microsoft's general manager for platform strategies, said he was happy to see Microsoft ahead of IBM among information technology buyers in a Jupiter Research study funded by Microsoft. "It clearly indicates Microsoft is doing better than perceived in the marketplace," Jupiter analyst Michael Gartenberg said. Taylor said Microsoft has moved its focus from total cost of ownership to interoperability. The next phase will be reliability, with security an ongoing subject, he said, adding that the priorities are based on customer queries. Interoperability is indeed a serious issue as technology such as the Internet, Web services and XML (Extensible Markup Language) becomes embedded into business transactions. Major computing companies are moving toward a future in which many different software applications interact, sending flurries of XML messages over the network. For example, one retailer may rely on another company to process credit card purchases, or a corporation might constantly update inventory and shipment information from suppliers and distributors. Taylor has spearheaded a series of studies that take a more "pragmatic" approach to criticizing competitors. The previous strategy--deriding Linux's open-source programming philosophy as "Pac-Man-like" or a cancer--backfired. The Microsoft-funded studies have proved controversial. After Microsoft touted a Forrester Research study that found development costs were lower for Windows than for Linux, the analyst firm changed its policy so that a company that funded a study was prohibited from publicizing it. In the latest study, Jupiter in December surveyed 800 information technology buyers working for U.S. companies with annual revenue of at least $10 million, asking about their opinions on interoperability. In the study, 72 percent viewed Microsoft favorably when it came to interoperability, more than any other company. Oracle was No. 2, with 68 percent viewing the company's technology favorably in regard to interoperability. IBM was third at 63 percent, followed by Sun Microsystems at 57 percent. Hewlett-Packard and Linux supporters such as Red Hat were tied for fifth place with 55 percent viewing them favorably. However, Stephen O'Grady of analyst firm RedMonk questioned one aspect of the study--how many surveyed need interoperability. Of those surveyed, only 36 percent have an IT environment with technology from a mix of companies, whereas 37 percent have a Microsoft-only environment. "I haven't talked to anyone in months who's homogeneous," O'Grady said, meaning customers that use technology from only a single company. Jupiter stands by its results. "If somebody else took 800 of their own professionals, qualified in the same way, they're going to get pretty much the same results," Gartenberg said. "There are many organizations that consider themselves a fairly homogeneous environment, with a dominant platform they built upon." Microsoft funded the study, but didn't control the questions asked or other content, Gartenberg said. IBM criticized the study. "A vendor-financed report based on some questionable criteria adds little to the very important discussion about IT integration," said spokesman Steve Eisenstadt. And Red Hat spokeswoman Leigh Day defended Linux. "Because Red Hat Enterprise Linux is available across seven platforms, it's easily fit into a heterogeneous environment," she said. Red Hat's Linux, as well as SuSE Linux from Novell, works on Intel Xeon and Itanium processors, Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron, and four proprietary IBM server lines. The study found that Web services work--pioneered by IBM and Microsoft, but now advocated and standardized by many other companies--tops the list of technologies preferred for linking applications together. Fifty-five percent favored Web services standards, the survey found. Though much of XML and Web services technology is based on open standards that make interoperability easier, using XML doesn't guarantee openness. Much of Microsoft's interoperability push has been based on XML, and the software giant is also trying to lock up numerous XML-related technologies. The company has applied for numerous XML-related patents, some of which could be used to lock out competing applications, according to analysts. Or Microsoft could provide royalty-free access to XML-related innovations, as it recently decided to do with the proprietary XML dialect, or schemas, used by its Office 2003 software. Microsoft isn't interested in interoperating with some Linux technology. Reiterating a point he made at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo in January, Taylor said it's the open-source community's responsibility to make sure Linux can share files properly with Windows systems. He likened the situation to the mid-1990s, when Microsoft took on the job of reverse-engineering Novell's IPX/SPX communication technology so Windows machines could easily fit into Novell networks. In any case, the Jupiter study showed that IT buyers were more concerned with getting applications to communicate with each other, not the ease of sharing files or connecting computers with a network. Microsoft's Get the Facts campaign has had mixed success so far, O'Grady said. On the one hand, "the tactical success has been impressive, as it appears to have generated a substantial amount of interest and calls to Microsoft on the topic," O'Grady said. On the other hand, though, "I don't know that the...campaign has had the success in moving the argument to an unemotional level that they think it has," O'Grady said. "If anything, I think it's flared up the debate in some quarters."
2005-09-02 - Microsoft limits Longhorn's Itanium job duties Microsoft's Longhorn Server version of Windows will support Intel's Itanium processor, but only for a limited number of higher-end jobs, the software company said Friday. Intel in recent years has positioned Itanium chiefly as a processor for powerful multiprocessor servers, a prestigious market, but one much smaller than originally envisioned. Microsoft's move essentially reinforces this big-iron positioning. "Longhorn Server for Itanium won't run all workloads," a Microsoft representative said in a statement. The operating system is designed for three specific types of higher-end tasks: databases, custom jobs and line-of-business applications such as accounting and customer relationship mananagment, or CRM. Among the tasks it won't be able to handle are "fax server, Windows Media Services, Windows SharePoint Services, file and print servers, and others," Microsoft said in a bulletin. Microsoft's move is the latest illustration of the less-ambitious role projected for Itanium. The processor family's debut was marred by delays, poor performance and software incompatibility with servers using x86 processors such as Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron. Many of those initial problems are now fixed, but in the meantime, x86 servers grew more powerful, and IBM ceased developing its own Itanium server. Itanium allies haven't given up and are still working on Itanium market development projects. The narrower role for Longhorn on Itanium dovetails with Microsoft's plans for an earlier server operating system, Windows Server 2003 R2, which is due out at the end of this year and won't be available for Itanium. The features coming with R2 are geared chiefly for tasks run by lower-end servers, Microsoft argues. Those features focus on identity and access management, branch office servers, and storage system setup and management. Novell's Suse Linux Enterprise Server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux also run on Itanium. And Hewlett-Packard, which began the development of Itanium and cooperated for years with Intel on the chip, offers its HP-UX version of Unix for Itanium, as well as its OpenVMS and NonStop operating systems.
2005-04-25 - Microsoft launches 64-bit Windows  After revving the engine for quite a while, Microsoft is hoping to take 64-bit computing into the fast lane. The software maker, which has been tooling around with the 64-bit version of Windows for the better part of two years, is announcing the general availability of the long-awaited product later on Monday. The company will start selling 64-bit editions of both Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Professional. The new Windows won't be showing up on retail shelves, though. Customers who buy a desktop or server with a 64-bit chip will have the option of getting the new operating system, while people who own an existing 64-bit machine will have the option of trading in their old 32-bit Windows for the 64-bit upgrade. Microsoft's announcement is welcome news, particularly for chipmaker AMD, which has had 64-bit server chips on the market for two years and 64-bit desktop processors for 18 months. The software maker issued a test version of 64-bit Windows in the fall of 2003, when AMD released its first Athlon 64 processors. A final version was planned for early last year, but encountered a number of delays. "With today's release of Microsoft's Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, customers can now fully realize the power of the AMD Opteron processor," AMD CEO Hector Ruiz said in a statement. Of course, while AMD has been waiting, rival Intel has come out with similar chips of its own. The so-called x64 versions of Windows support chips from Intel and AMD that have added 64-bit instructions to the existing Pentium and Athlon architectures. Microsoft already has a version of Windows for Intel's high-end 64-bit Itanium chip, which uses a completely distinct instructions set. Drivers wanted Now that Microsoft has finally finished its 64-bit work, the company is doing all it can to get others to follow suit. Having the hardware and software isn't the only thing that is needed. In order to effectively work in 64-bit environments, computer users also need updated drivers for their hardware add-ons, which are things like scanners and printers. That is the one area where Microsoft still needs help--a message Microsoft executives have stressed for some time and are likely to reiterate at this week's Windows Hardware Engineering Conference in Seattle. So far, about 16,000 drivers have been rewritten to support the new operating system. Already, PC makers are hopping on the bandwagon, particularly on the server side. Hewlett-Packard, for example, plans to announce support for the 64-bit version of Windows Server across its ProLiant line of servers. "It's not quite there on the client," said Greg Sullivan, a lead product manager in Microsoft's Windows unit. Sullivan said that for now, the desktop 64-bit Windows version is likely to appeal mainly to the hardest of the hard-core enthusiasts--people doing video rendering, or game development, for example. Dell said it will install the 64-bit operating system on its Precision workstation line and on its PowerEdge servers. Orders for the Dell Precision 470 and 670 workstations can be placed starting Monday, while the server OS will be available on Dell systems starting in June, the computer manufacturer said. While right now it is the game developers that are likely to run 64-bit Windows, the gamers themselves won't be far behind. "In the Longhorn time frame, we think it (64-bit computing) will be mainstream." Sullivan said. Microsoft has said that Longhorn--the next version of Windows--will come in both 32-bit and 64-bit flavors. Long and winding road Although the road to 64-bit Windows has taken longer than Microsoft once hoped, Windows Chief Jim Allchin said in a recent interview that the shift is now inevitable. Intel and AMD aren't charging significantly more for chips with the added abilities, nor is Microsoft charging more for its operating system. "I see it as preordained," Allchin said. By the end of the year, Allchin said it will be quite difficult to find a server with a 32-bit processor. Desktop PCs will move slower, but 64-bit PCs should make up a significant chunk of shipments by next year. When computing does make the leap, Allchin said the benefits will be significant, even if many of them are not yet apparent. The clearest impact of 64-bit computing is the ability to deal with more than 4GB of physical memory. However, only the most sophisticated applications and databases are bumping up against this limit today. Down the road, though, Allchin said whole new ways of computing will open up. Imagine, how fast searching might be if all of one's e-mail, for example, were loaded into memory. But Allchin said there are performance gains that many types of programs can today get if companies are willing to slightly rewrite their applications. He pointed to Cakewalk, a music program that got a 40 percent gain by moving to a 64-bit system. There are also ways that Microsoft can use the added bits to enhance security, he said. Specifically, Allchin said Microsoft will make better use of the no-execute chip feature, which helps prevent overflow errors. "It doesn't make things perfect," Allchin said. But, he added, "it is another way of preventing mischief from taking place."
2003-09-23 - Microsoft hops on the 64-bit bus   Microsoft on Tuesday said it had released a beta version of its Windows XP operating system for 64-bit PCs based on Advanced Micro Devices' new Athlon 64 processor. Dubbed Windows XP 64-Bit Edition for 64-Bit Extended Systems, the operating system will run on PCs with the Athlon 64 chip and also workstations using AMD's Opteron chip, Microsoft said. Gates looks ahead to 64-bit eraBill Gates, chairman, Microsoft The announcement is a key vote of support for AMD, which is attempting to line up a number of software partners to support its new 64-bit chips--the kinds of partners it will need to support the chip in the company's attempt to reach the upper echelons of the PC market. The 64-bit measurement refers to the amount of memory that a chip can access via the PC's data bus at any one moment. News.context What's new: Microsoft issues a beta version of Windows XP for PCs running AMD's new 64-bit chips, with support for 32-bit applications as well. Bottom line: Tuesday's announcement is a vote of confidence for AMD's processor ambitions, which need the support of software makers. But the Microsoft OSes won't come as soon as the chipmaker had hoped. More stories on this topic One of the most notable aspects of the new operating system will be Windows on Windows 64, a feature that allows people who have current 32-bit applications to continue running those applications after upgrading to the 64-bit version of Windows XP. The feature is made possible by the construction of the AMD's 64-bit chips, which support both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. "We?ve heard from our customers that, until now, the inability to efficiently run 32-bit applications on 64-bit systems has been a major barrier to investing in 64-bit technologies," Chris Jones, vice president of Microsoft's Windows Client Division, said in a statement. However, Microsoft confirmed Tuesday that the final version of 64-bit Windows won't be available until the first quarter of next year. The test version, which Microsoft released this week, was supposed to have come out mid-year, with many analysts expecting a final version by the end of this year. The reason is that the company wanted to synchronize its release with a service pack for Windows Server 2003, which is also due out early next year, said Microsoft product manager Brian Marr. Although the 64-bit version is designed to run on desktop machines, it is actually built on the Windows Server 2003 kernel, he said. In an interview, Marr said Microsoft has not yet determined how much customers who buy 64-bit AMD systems now will have to pay for the new software. One of the chief benefits of moving from 32 bits to 64 bits is the ability to add more memory to a PC. Customers using the new chip and software will be able to use more than 4GB of memory--the current limit of 32-bit computers. While most performance PCs sold today come with between 512MB and 1GB of RAM, systems with between 4GB and 8GB will become more commonplace as 64-bit software works its way onto the desktop and as RAM module sizes gain more data storage capacity, AMD has said. Although Marr acknowledged that the immediate appeal of 64-bit desktop computers is mainly to gamers and those who create videos, he said that in a year or two such systems could allow office workers to have their computers translate international phone calls. Intel has not committed to a plan to bring 64-bit computing to the desktop. The company could create a desktop version of its Itanium processor, which runs 32-bit programs only through emulation, or it could follow AMD's approach, which adds 64-bit instructions to the existing Pentium-compatible architecture. Marr said AMD's tactic makes sense. "That particular architecture has the makings for something that can be widely adopted and used by a wide variety of customers," he said. The chipmaker is also working with game developers such as Epic and software makers that author video-editing software, the company has said.

2001-05-23 - Microsoft cues up test of high-end Windows Microsoft on Wednesday announced that a long-awaited high-end version of its Windows XP operating system, intended to compete with Unix, is entering customer testing. Microsoft announced two versions: 64-bit Windows Advanced Server Limited Edition for servers and Windows XP 64-Bit Edition for workstations. The 64-bit versions of Windows will be made available on a limited basis, bundled with systems using Intel's Itanium processor. Itanium, Intel's long-anticipated and much-delayed successor to the Pentium processor, will move computers to a 64-bit architecture from 32-bit. New 64-bit systems can accomplish roughly double the amount of work as 32-bit systems in a given amount of time. Major computer manufacturers including Compaq Computer, Dell Computer, Hewlett-Packard and IBM have shown off early versions of Itanium systems in the last couple of months. While both 64-bit operating systems are technically test, or beta, versions, Microsoft in an unusual move will provide product support for both, said Michael Stephenson, Windows 2002 Server product manager. Customers also will receive free upgrades to the final versions when they are available. For Microsoft, the early test version of 64-bit Windows is a milestone, as the company also prepares for the launch of 32-bit Windows XP. Both the 32-bit and 64-bit desktop versions of Windows XP will ship Oct. 25. Greg Sullivan, Windows XP product manager, made it clear that 64-bit computing is not for everyone. But for those who need the computing power required of the architecture, their choices are limited to fairly expensive alternatives. "We basically will take the economics of the PC model, the experience we have in mobilizing high-volume hardware manufacturers, software vendors and device manufacturers, and apply that to this very high-end technical computing space," he said. More importantly, it clears the way for the Redmond, Wash.-based company to cue up for testing its 64-bit applications, such as its SQL Server database. "We do have plans to make a 64-bit version of SQL Server available. A beta version will ship this summer, and a final release will happen shortly after we launch the Whistler server family," Stephenson said. The server operating system launch is slated for early 2002.Forrester Research analyst Carl Howe said Microsoft has done well to finally clarify uncertainties about its 64-bit Windows plans. "One of the challenges for Microsoft has been trying to stay on top of the ever slipping Itanium schedule, because frankly, a few months makes a huge difference in how they position this." At one point, Microsoft had considered releasing a 64-bit version of Windows 2000 Professional that would be available for just a few months preceding the Windows XP version. But Itanium's dimmed future as a production chip helped Microsoft back away from that strategy and go strictly for Windows XP, analysts say. The 64-bit Windows XP and Advanced Server betas are crucial for Intel's setting the stage for successor chip McKinley, said Gartner analyst Michael Silver. "Intel wants to get people on Itanium now and testing so that when 64-bit becomes a more useful platform, they're ready for it," he said. "They need to start to get developers working on 64-bit applications. This is where the real work starts." Itanium and computers containing it will compete against more expensive Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) servers and workstations running Unix. Those systems are sold by Sun Microsystems, IBM and other makers. The release of the 64-bit beta is as important for Microsoft as for Intel, said Guernsey Research analyst Chris LeTocq "From a revenue perspective it is probably insignificant, but from a credibility's standpoint it is important," he said. "Having a 64-bit OS out there and being able to sway with the big boys, that's significant." Stephenson said Microsoft has been working with Intel for about five years to deliver a 64-bit operating system. "We're still in the phase of working with (PC makers) to do early customer evaluations, and we're still working with software developers to get applications ready," he said. Microsoft has identified about 300 applications being developed for Intel 64-bit processors. Although Itanium has long been anticipated, its arrival may be muted, despite the availability of 64-bit Windows XP. Intel on Wednesday acknowledged that the chip, which initially will be used in PC workstations and servers, and telecommunications servers, is merely a way station to its successor, McKinley, due next year. "This is just a shakedown cruise to make sure 64-bit is ready for prime time," Howe said. "This is a far cry from what everybody expected--turning it into a development--but it's also fairly realistic. This is not for widespread adoption. This is not a system for which you should be planning to run Oracle this year." While Linux and other operating systems will also be available for Itanium, Intel is banking on Windows and its huge market share to drive sales, analysts say. "Intel really wants a Microsoft OS to run on Itanium," Silver said. With 64-bit versions of Linux also available, "Microsoft doesn't want to not be on the platform with Unix variants out there for Itanium." Beyond testing, real-world use may have to wait until 64-bit applications reach the market. The problem is a lack of applications, analysts say. "Right now, if it's an OS without apps, what good is it?" Silver asked. "Even though 32-bit apps run, it's not something you don't want to do." While Itanium will run 32-bit applications in emulation mode--a way of simulating older processors--testers report unsatisfactory performance. "You use this in 32-bit emulation and you're going to be underimpressed," Howe said. With the delivery of 64-bit Windows XP and Advanced Server, computer makers can finally start selling Itanium-based systems, which initially are expected to be used for more demanding applications. Dell on Tuesday launched its first Itanium server, the PowerEdge 7150, which will be available by August. Gartner predicts that initial 64-bit system adoption will be on servers. "We won't see it as mainstream on the desktop until 2006, 2007," Silver said. But for PC makers hoping to sell Itanium systems this year, the repositioning "is clearly going to be a disappointment for them," Howe said. "They were hoping it was going to rev up their sales. Saying it's a development is not the message they want their customers to hear."
2004-05-25 - Memory glitch delays IBM Power blade   A memory problem has triggered a three-month delay in IBM's JS20 server, a system at the center of three major strategies in Big Blue's server group, the company confirmed Monday. The JS20, which uses dual PowerPC 970 processors, already was delayed from a late 2003 launch to early March. But one customer testing early systems encountered a problem involving "memory robustness," said IBM spokesman Jim Larkin, and the server maker postponed general shipments until it can resolve the issue. The systems now are scheduled for June 11 availability, Larkin said. The problem "has been completely resolved to the satisfaction of IBM and the customer," he added. The JS20 embodies three major IBM server strategies. First, it uses a member of IBM's Power family processors, which the company aimed initially at Intel's Itanium and Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc, but which increasingly competes with Intel's widely used Xeon as well. Second, the JS20 runs Linux, an operating system that bridges some divides between IBM's four server lines. Linux is comparatively common on "x86" processors such as Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron, but IBM is trying to build a comparably vigorous Linux software community for the Power processors. Last, the JS20 is a blade server, a type of system that slides snugly alongside others in a chassis that provides shared components such as power supplies and networking switches. IBM believes that many of today's lower-end standalone servers eventually will be replaced by blade servers. The problem with the JS20 doesn't involve its processor, the PowerPC 970, Larkin said. IBM has had manufacturing problems with the chips, but said earlier in May that the quality is improving. However, shipments of Apple Computer's Xserve, which also uses the PowerPC 970, have been constrained by a shortage of chips from IBM. "Obviously we were not happy with the delivery we got," Timothy Cook, Apple's executive vice president of worldwide sales and operations, said in April, adding that the company hopes to have caught up with demand by the end of June.
2003-03-21 - McNealy Rattling cages is good for Sun SINGAPORE--Being controversial helps Sun Microsystems stand out in a highly commoditized technology market, CEO Scott McNealy says. "I can't worry about skepticism. If there's no controversy, and everybody buys into our ideas and follows them, there is no chance of making money," McNealy told reporters at a press briefing following his public address here Wednesday. "The question is whether we have a controversial and right strategy. If so, we'll make a lot of money," he said. During the public speech, McNealy gave his take on the future network and debatable developments that will constitute "the next big thing in technology"--all powered by Sun's products, of course. He put forward the company's bold N1 and "throughput computing" efforts under which new layers of software will be designed to better coordinate and utilize computing and storage power in corporate systems. In addition, McNealy envisioned a world where handheld devices and Java smart cards will provide users with secure mobility and ubiquitous access to the Internet, possibly rendering the present-day PC redundant. As an example, user identities can be stored in Java smart cards while their desktop information and applications are saved on the enterprise server. People only need to go to a 'dumb' client such as a Sun Ray workstation, slide their Java cards through and they will be able be retrieve their desktop, McNealy said. This way, people are not bound to their terminals, and in instances like an office move, no tedious reconfiguration is necessary. Unlike PCs, which house their own processors, Sun Ray desktops mostly rely on a central server to do most processing tasks. They are equipped with smart card readers for user authentication. While the concept of having an all-in-one card may seem far-fetched for most countries, McNealy feels it could be feasible in a small but technologically advanced state like Singapore. "This is probably the only place on the planet to be able to realize this Java card vision," he said. Describing Intel's Itanium chip as a "serious disaster from a very good company," McNealy confirmed plans for the launch of a new Sun microprocessor next year. Dubbed Niagara, the new processor will come with eight processor cores that can handle four instructions each, he said. McNealy left Singapore last night to continue the Australian and Indian leg of his Asian tour, where more gibes against rivals like Microsoft and Intel can be expected. CNET Asia's Winston Chai reported from Singapore.
2001-10-08 - MandrakeSoft updates Linux for Itanium MandrakeSoft on Monday released a third beta version of its Itanium edition of Linux, the French company said. Itanium is the first 64-bit processor from Intel, but the high-end product still has only early operating system support from Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Red Hat, SuSE and others. The new Mandrake version comes with support for XFS, ReiserFS and ext3, three "journaling" file systems that make rebooting faster. It also uses version 2.4.8 of the Linux kernel, the latest 2.2.1 version of the KDE desktop user interface and 2.2.1a of the Samba software for joining Windows networks.
2004-05-10 - Makers of white-box supercomputers hit their stride    Thunder, a supercomputer recently installed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is possibly the second-most powerful computing machine on the planet--and it was built by a company with about as many employees as a real estate office. California Digital, a 55-person company located on the outskirts of Silicon Valley, created Thunder from 1,024 four-processor Itanium 2 servers to perform a variety of tasks at the lab. Capable of churning 19.94 trillion operations per second, it would have ranked second in the Top 500 list of supercomputers published bi-annually by the University of Mannheim, the University of Tennessee and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, had it made the deadline. News.context What's new: Formerly the realm of monolithic machines full of proprietary hardware and software from the likes of IBM, the supercomputing market has been invaded by small companies that rely on standardized components, networks of clustered computers and the open-source Linux operating system. Bottom line: Though many of these cluster contracts still go to major players like Dell, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, small companies are undeniably winning many prestigious projects. Little-known firms such as Linux Networx, California Digital and Optimus are scoring deals with the Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos and U.S. Army research labs, among others. More stories on this topic The key to the setup, and many like it, is to use the Linux operating system to lash together a lot of comparatively cheap, off-the-shelf hardware to quickly create computers with enough power to simulate the potential effects of explosions or crunch data on galaxy formation. The machines can cost millions of dollars, but they're still about a third less expensive than traditional supercomputers of comparable power. "The tier-one vendors don't have as much of a handle on this market as other areas," said Douglas Bone, president of Fremont, Calif.-based California Digital, which has also installed large Linux clusters for several Fortune 500 companies. Other small companies are involved in the nascent field as well. Utah's Linux Networx, for instance, is building two supercomputing clusters based on Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron processor for the Los Alamos National Laboratory: A 2,816-processor cluster will be used to study nuclear stockpiling, while a smaller 512-processor cluster will be dedicated to smaller problems with lower security clearances. The company is also creating a cluster with 2,132 Intel Xeon processors for the U.S. Army Research Laboratory. Other companies in the market include Poway, Calif.-based ProMicro; Poland's Optimus; and Verari Systems, formerly called RackSaver. Component specialists such as Mellanox and SuperMicro are also participating. "They are getting serious traction," said Robert Pennington, interim director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. "There were a couple of small companies trying to do this about five years ago, but they were just testing it." The NCSA has had two major Linux clusters installed and is currently considering bids on another large cluster. Sophisticated, but affordable The turn away from monolithic machines stuffed with proprietary hardware and software built by companies such as IBM, Cray and NEC has come about through a combination of technological sophistication and appealing prices. While computers such as NEC's Earth Simulator are still preferred for some tasks, such as weather prediction, researchers have found that most applications can be run on clusters of two- and four-processor assemblies from Intel or Advanced Micro Devices running Linux. Get Up to Speed on... Open source Get the latest headlines andcompany-specific news in ourexpanded GUTS section. (Large clusters, including a much heralded one at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, have also been built out of Apple PCs running IBM chips. Srinidhi Varadarajan, the brains behind Virginia Tech's cluster, also serves as California Digital's chief technology officer.) Many of these cluster contracts still go to large computer makers. Dell and IBM installed the first two NCSA clusters, and Hewlett-Packard has also signed several contracts. But small companies are undeniably winning many prestigious projects. Increased familiarity at the labs with these types of systems has cut implementation times and costs. Lawrence Livermore, for example, has hired its own Linux kernel and compiler experts to speed the shift to clusters. "We're not buying a solution. We buy the pieces individually and act as the general contactor," said Mark Seager, assistant department head for advance technology at Lawrence Livermore. "By doing this, we are getting a huge price-performance boost, by a factor of two or three." Although the core servers are built around standardized components, heavy-duty technical expertise is required to jump into this market. Linux Networx helps customers decide how many processors and how much memory to install, as well as what sort of interconnect technology--InfiniBand, Gigabit Ethernet, Quadrics' QSNet, or Myricom's MyriNet--will be most appropriate. And it assembles and tests the servers and interconnects in its own factory before shipping them for easy reassembly at the customer site. Software also is a huge component of the contracts. "As the watermark of commodity, off-the-shelf technology rises, the area of our differentiation also moves up. More and more of the percentage of system value (is) from those things that go around the hardware," said Bernard Daines, founder and CEO of Linux Networx. Verari in April acquired MPI Software, a small company specializing in the Message Passing Interface software that lets different nodes in a cluster communicate. "There is a fair amount of sophistication needed to truly understand what is going on, on the software side of a cluster and to eliminate latency on the network," said Bone of California Digital. "There is no technical reason why someone could not figure out the intricacies of clusters, but it requires a methodological accumulation of expertise of low-latency interconnects, management tools and other things." Technical expertise aside, these smaller companies are also getting a boost from government policies designed to help the little guy. "As a government organization, we have to help small corporations," said Lawrence Livermore's Seager. "We feel this is something we should encourage. Being small isn't a killer as long as they are qualified." A short history of clusters The cluster paradigm--independent machines connected with a high-speed network--has been around for more than 15 years, according to Dave Turek, leader of IBM's "Deep Computing" team. "What's changed in recent years is that they can be assembled using Linux, Intel or AMD processors and conventional networks instead of exotic, rare or customized technology." Many say the turnover began in 1999 and 2000. At that time, mass-produced and relatively inexpensive Intel chips began to surpass RISC chips in performance, according to Intel executives, a gap that has continued to widen. Linux and Beowulf clustering technology, which allows Linux boxes to be tied together, have also become more widespread. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. Lawrence Livermore created its first Linux-Intel cluster in the late 1990s. The machine contained Pentium II chips, which limited memory bandwidth, but Seager said the lab knew the setup would evolve. The introduction of the Pentium 4 became a watershed moment for the lab by expanding bandwidth from 800 megabytes per second to 2.4 gigabytes per second, Seager said. These smaller companies to some degree followed the lead of what the labs were doing. "We were building these clusters by hand. They were offering to put these things together for us. They would do the assembly but not provide much support," said the NCSA's Pennington. California Digital was founded in 1994 and initially specialized in relatively generic Intel servers. In June 2001, it bought the hardware unit of VA Linux and refocused itself on the high-performance computing market. The Thunder project then came along after Lawrence Livermore researchers were impressed with manageability tools California Digital released to the open-source community. By chance, the company had just completed an Itanium 2 project for a large corporate client--"one of the biggest corporations in the world," Bone said--that required California Digital to build a cluster that could run 21 different applications, an unusually large amount. Breaking into this market isn't easy, though. "This is a very tight-knit community," said Jason Waxman, director of multiprocessor platform marketing at Intel. Not only do companies have to have technical sophistication, "they have to know what it takes to win a bid and deal with government contracts." "This is not a field where you can walk in off the street. You have to have some credibility," Pennington added. The tight-knit nature of the market also involves to some extent the secrecy of various computing projects. Waxman knows of a relatively new start-up formed by refugees from one of the classic supercomputer makers, but he said he couldn't reveal the name. California Digital's Bone said he couldn't reveal the names of any corporate customers. Pennington, meanwhile, refused to divulge the scope of NCSA's current proposal request. Despite these challenges, however, the growth opportunities for these companies seem strong. "In the future, we will be getting more Linux clusters," said Seager.

2007-01-29 - Mainframe firm claims IBM antitrust violation  A month after IBM sued Platform Solutions Inc. for breaching its contract and infringing patents, PSI has filed a countersuit that denies the charges and accuses Big Blue of abusing a monopoly in mainframe servers. PSI sells technology that lets Itanium-based machines run IBM's z/OS mainframe operating system and other software. IBM didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. "In an effort to eliminate consumer choice and destroy the only viable source of competition to its own mainframe computers, IBM is tying its mainframe computers to its mainframe operating systems by conditioning the sale of its operating systems upon the purchase or continued use of an IBM mainframe computer," PSI said in its suit. And in a statement, Christian Reilly, PSI's vice president of product management and marketing added, "What IBM is trying to do here would be the equivalent to a hypothetical situation in which Microsoft had monopoly power in the markets for both PCs and PC operating systems and then refused to license Windows to HP, Dell, or other PC manufacturers to maintain and sustain its monopoly position."

1999-12-09 - Linux-on-Itanium effort gets more backing  A coalition of firms aiming to make the Linux operating system work on Intel's upcoming Itanium chip is getting bigger, with the addition of the four biggest Linux sellers, sources said. Leading Linux seller Red Hat won a place in the coalition, dubbed Trillian, when it acquired software development toolmaker Cygnus Solutions in November. Soon it will be joined by Caldera Systems, TurboLinux and SuSE, the three other largest sellers of the Unix-like operating system, sources familiar with the plan said. The Trillian project is a big factor in the future success of Linux, as companies try to push the operating system to the loftier position occupied by the closely related Unix operating system. Though Linux runs on several 64-bit chips, such as the UltraSparc from Sun Microsystems, the Alpha from Compaq and the PA-RISC from Hewlett-Packard, the Linux stronghold today is on 32-bit chips from Intel. The Linux operating system is particularly popular in servers and many see it as competing both with Windows and Unix. It was developed by Linus Torvalds and countless other programmers and has made its way into the product lines of the world's biggest computing companies. The Itanium is Intel's first 64-bit processor in its IA-64 family and the spearhead of its effort to take on the high-end chips from Sun Microsystems and others. Moving to a 64-bit architecture means the computer can deal with much larger amounts of memory and much larger databases, two important features for big businesses. Trillian members currently are chiefly hardware companies: Intel, VA Linux Systems, SGI, HP and IBM. The other two members are the European Laboratory for Particle Physics and Cygnus, which writes the software that translates programs written by people into instructions a computer can understand. Adding the software companies means the effort will be broadened to include the companies who actually will sell products based on Trillian. The development of Trillian currently is happening behind closed doors, a contrast to the usual methods of open-source programming. But the results of the effort will be shared midway through the first quarter of 2000--likely February--when Intel will release the participating companies from their nondisclosure agreements, said Ron Curry, leader of IA-64 marketing at Intel. Intel wants to see as many operating systems as possible succeed on its IA-64 chip. The company has invested in Red Hat, TurboLinux and SuSE. Caldera Systems confirmed its participation in the Trillian project. "We've already allocated resources. We're excited to be on this project," said Caldera Systems' Benoy Tamang. "It's necessary in order for us to maintain our own momentum and keep up with the new archtitecture. We believe strongly that the Merced [the code name for Itanium] version of Linux will be just critical." Intel versions of Caldera Systems software account for more than 90 percent of revenues, Tamang said. Intel declined to comment on the new partners. SuSE also confirmed its participation in Trillian. "All the primary Linux distributors have agreements in place with Intel to get the early release of the chips so we can have distributions ready in time for the primary launch," said Marc Torres, president of the U.S. branch of SuSE, which is based in Germany. Linux, which already runs on many different chips, is relatively easy to transfer from one type to another because the chip-specific sections are isolated in a separate section and the bulk of the software doesn't have to be changed, Torres said. TurboLinux chief executive Cliff Miller declined to comment on the specifics of the Trillian project and Red Hat representatives were not immediately available for comment. "We work very closely with Intel on several things, but we're unfortunately not able to talk about the Trillian project," Miller said in an interview. However, he said Trillian and the IA-64 chips will increase the Linux muscle. "Right now if you want 64-bit power, you go to other hardware platforms, which tend not to be commodity hardware," he said. Though versions of Unix from HP, Sun and IBM will be available on IA-64, Miller predicted that Linux would lead the way. "With a company like Intel behind getting these commodity boxes with 64-bit processing power, you're going to see some pretty fierce competition in the server market. I think you'll see Linux really leading that drive on the Intel platform for these servers," Miller said. Intel has begun shipping hundreds of prototype Itanium computers and chips to hardware companies, the company said.
2000-05-26 - Linux programmers get a taste of the future    Linux programmers wanting a glimpse of things to come will be able to try out three machines at VA Linux Systems with Intel's upcoming Itanium chips, the Linux hardware maker will announce tomorrow. The three four-processor servers fulfill a promise made by Intel chairman Andy Grove in August that Linux programmers would be able to write software for the new Itanium chips even if they lacked their own machines. The machines will be accessible over the Internet. The Itanium chip, due to arrive in computers later this year, is a totally new design, the first in Intel's "IA-64" family that the chipmaker hopes will carry it into the most serious computers as well as today's beefed-up desktop machines. Eric Sindelar, IA-64 product manager at VA, will select the projects for the machines to ensure that the machines are put to serious work. "The goal is that everybody who submits a viable proposal gets on," Sindelar said. Intel has been going through contortions to meet the unusual needs of the open-source community, the global collection of programmers who produce the Linux operating system. These people don't fit easily into the secretive preparations for past product launches. Intel has to be accommodating, though. It has declared that Linux is one of three operating systems that will be a major force on Itanium. The other two are Windows and a version of Unix called "Monterey" being developed by IBM and Santa Cruz Operation. Intel isn't the only company working to help Linux programmers convert their software for Itanium. Sources have said that Hewlett-Packard will release software that allows an ordinary Intel computer to act like an IA-64 machine. And SGI has released its own programming tools for Linux. Intel has a vested interest in seeing Linux succeed. In addition to the chipmaker's investments in TurboLinux, Red Hat, SuSE, Cobalt Networks, eSoft and other Linux companies, Linux gives Intel an operating system that's not controlled by companies with competing hardware such as Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer, IBM or Sun Microsystems. To get access to the system, people must sign a nondisclosure agreement that requires them not to release information about how fast the systems perform, Sindelar said. The three Itanium systems use TurboLinux' version of Linux for Itanium. Sindelar said the company expects to upgrade the Itanium systems and add new ones in the future. VA is one of the members of the project to bring Linux to the IA-64 design. The effort formerly was known as "Trillian," but the group dropped it when Trillium Digital Systems complained that the similarity between the two names was causing confusion.
2006-08-11 - Linux powers unusual multicore machine A start-up called Movidis believes a 16-core chip originally designed for networking gear will be a ticket to success in the Linux server market. Movidis is announcing two new servers using the chip in conjunction with next week's LinuxWorld Conference and Expo in San Francisco. The Revolution x16 models each use a single 500MHz or 600MHz Cavium Networks Octeon CN3860 chip, said Ken Goldsholl, the company's co-founder and chief technology officer. Sixteen cores is a lot compared with current processors, and multiple cores boost servers by farming different tasks to different parts of the chip. Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc T1 "Niagara" chip has eight cores, while mainstream x86 chips from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices will move from today's dual-core designs to quad-core models within the next year. But Movidis systems have a major difference from mainstream servers: Their chips use MIPS processor cores, an architecture originally designed by Silicon Graphics. MIPS chips can't run software for major server processors of the x86, Sparc, Power or Itanium ilk. "I do believe people will take a chance with a different architecture to get other things they need," Goldsholl said. Another company that tried MIPS servers, Cobalt Networks, dropped the design in favor of x86 chips, and SGI is moving to Intel processors. With open-source software, though, new versions can be compiled for the chip, and the version of Debian Linux that Cavium supplies with the chip works with the Revolution x16 servers with only minor modifications, Goldsholl said. The company also includes higher-level software such as the Apache Web server and the MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, and supports it all. Costs for the system range from $3,000 for a 1.75-inch think model with no drives to $12,000 for the 3.5-inch model with the maximum of eight drives, he said. The Octeon chips consume only 30 watts of power. The overall systems have networking acceleration, eight gigabit Ethernet ports, and hardware-based encryption abilities. Like Sun's X4500 "Thumper" system, Movidis' products had their genesis as a video-streaming server. But "it was very hard to break into video-on-demand," Goldsholl said. Cable TV companies were "very reluctant to buy from a brand-new small company." He thinks he'll get farther with the general-purpose server market.
2003-08-05 - Linux on Itanium passes milestone  Special Coverage It's a LinuxWorld Read CNET News.com's complete coverage from the Linux gathering. The Itanium version of Linux crossed an important threshold Monday, developers said: It now can be built from the standard software maintained by Linux leader Linus Torvalds rather than requiring special patches. "As of this morning, Linus' current (kernel) builds and works out of the box for ia64!" Linux-Itanium leader David Mosberger, a Hewlett-Packard programmer, said in a mailing list message. The version uses Torvalds' 2.5 development version of the kernel, or heart, of Linux, which in coming months is expected to become the 2.6 version, which will be sound enough for real-world use. IA-64 is the former name for the set of instructions the Itanium processor can understand. The fact that those instructions are different from Intel's widely used Pentium and Xeon processors means that building an Itanium version of Linux--or any other software--has its challenges. Itanium is Intel's effort to move its success in lower-end servers to high-end machines as well that today use processors such as Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc or IBM's Power4. But Torvalds has frowned upon Itanium. "I really dislike IA-64. I think it's a losing strategy," Torvalds said in an October speech. "My personal hope is that IA-64 withers and dies because there's no point. It performs badly; it's expensive; it's an all-new instruction set...I find AMD's approach a lot more interesting." Companies such as Red Hat and SuSE Linux that sell Itanium versions of Linux currently do so with several customizations. Mosberger still recommends using those customized versions of Linux for better performance and stability. One high-profile Linux programmer working on Linux support for UltraSparc said in a follow-up note on the same mailing list that based on his experience, programmers shouldn't be so ebullient. "I hate to rain on your parade, but for a platform that has so many companies paying people full time to maintain under Linux, having it take this long is a big disappointment for me," wrote David Miller, a Red Hat programmer. "The fact that there are still 'external patches for performance' is even more disheartening." Fellow Red Hat programmer Alan Cox took a more conciliatory tone. The Itanium version of Linux initially was "hideously divergent" from regular Linux, he said. "It may be that ia64 should have aimed in a different direction from day one, but having finally ended up in the right place is a milestone." Mosberger said he hopes programmers now will build new versions of Linux daily off Torvalds' kernel so new bugs can be stamped out quickly.
2000-05-17 - Linux makes inroads into high-end computers    Parallel actions by Hewlett-Packard, SGI and Red Hat are combining to put major muscle into the development of Linux for Intel's future flagship Itanium chip. Gartner analyst George Weiss says Linux technology and the market itself are not mature enough for a significant run at the high end. see commentary   Next week, Hewlett-Packard and Intel are expected to release programming tools that will enable people to create and run software designed for the new chip, sources familiar with the companies' plans said. Though some of these tools exist already, the key new feature will be an HP product that lets people try out Itanium software without having to wait for one of the relatively rare prototype machines. Intel and HP representatives declined to comment on the plan. Meanwhile, SGI--a maker of high-end computers that is banking much of its future on Linux and Intel chips--released its own tools Monday to help write software for Itanium computers. Members of the Trillian team creating Linux for Itanium have been eagerly awaiting these critical tools, called "compilers," which translate programming code into instructions a computer chip can understand. While HP has the most experience with the details of the IA-64 architecture, SGI is good with compiler expertise in other areas. "They have had historically very good compilers, and they have very good compiler people," said MicroDesign Resources analyst Keith Diefendorff said. The release of the HP emulation software will be accompanied by compilers developed by Cygnus and supporting software called libraries from Intel. Red Hat has caught up to rival TurboLinux by releasing its test version of Linux for the Itanium chip. TurboLinux released its first version, a very raw prototype, two months ago. The moves are critical for Linux if it's going to meet the expectations Intel and others have for the upstart operating system, still too new to be suitable for most high-end applications. Consequently, Linux currently is most popular in low-end servers based on 32-bit Intel chips, but Itanium and its successors in Intel's "IA-64" family offer a path that could lead Linux into higher-end computers. But developing software for the new chip is difficult right now because there are so few Itanium prototype computers to go around. Intel has shipped more than 3,000 so far, but the systems are in high demand and aren't available to the vast majority of Linux programmers. The three announcements illustrate the cooperative nature of the Linux movement: All the companies involved, as well as others, can take advantage of the software its competitors are releasing. By comparison, Microsoft and Sun are working separately to develop Itanium versions of their own operating systems. Linux, a clone of Unix developed by a host of "open-source" programmers who share software, competes with Windows and versions of Unix from Sun and others. To accommodate the Linux movement, Intel has had to curtail its usually secretive methods, sharing more chip information than is typical for an unreleased product. The goal is that Itanium versions of Linux will be available at the same time Itanium systems ship later this year. Linux dovetails with Intel's philosophy of bringing high-end technology into mainstream computers. Intel hopes the Itanium chip and its successors will bring Intel technology into expensive, high-power computers that previously were the domain of Sun, Compaq, IBM and SGI, each of which have 64-bit processors. The Itanium chip, Intel's first 64-bit processor, will be able to manage vastly larger databases than 32-bit chips and will be much faster at mathematical calculations. HP, the original inventor of the design underlying the IA-64 chips, has its own compilers but has yet to release them. "In my talking to HP, my feeling is they believe their value-add in this whole IA-64 proposition is their compiler," Diefendorff said. More surprising to Diefendorff was the fact that SGI chose to release its compiler. Likely reasons for the move include an attempt to win the attention, respect and goodwill of the Linux community and to foster development of software that will run on the type of computers SGI is good at building, such as its next-generation SN-1. SGI released its compilers as open-source software under the General Public License license, which allows other programmers--including SGI competitors--to see how SGI achieved its reputation for strong compiler abilities. In addition, the SGI compilers may legally be fused with compilers from Red Hat's Cygnus team or modified by a user. Microsoft is attached to the IA-64 architecture for some of the same reasons as Linux companies are: a way to penetrate untapped high-end markets. Microsoft's new Windows 2000 operating system is helping to undo the company's reputation for crash-prone software, but at the same time, the number of chips Windows runs on has dropped from four in the 1990s to one today. Intel favors three operating systems for IA-64 computers: Linux, Windows and a version of Unix called Monterey-64 being jointly developed by IBM and Santa Cruz Operation. IBM has its own plans for using Linux in high-end machines. The company's work developing Linux for its mainframe S/390 computers has now become an actual product. TurboLinux and SuSE, two of the four major sellers of Linux, will distribute Linux for the S/390 in partnership with IBM's global services, IBM said today. The new version will allow Linux software to be used on these very expensive but very reliable servers, opening them to a wider range of uses. Sun, though its Solaris operating system is more mature than Linux, can only dream of the attention Intel is lavishing on Linux. Intel and Sun are feuding over how much support Intel will give Sun in developing Solaris for IA-64. At the root of the disagreement is the fact that Sun prefers to sell computers based on its own UltraSparc chips.
2004-08-02 - Linux fervor on display at trade show  The growing normalcy of Linux in the corporate computing realm will be on display this week at a show devoted to the open-source operating system. Linus Torvalds launched Linux as a student project nearly 13 years ago, and by the late 1990s the software had attracted support from the computing industry. Now Linux is a staple of the information technology diet and a component of computing company strategies to get an edge over their competitors. At the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo in San Francisco, some of those strategies will be on display. Among server sellers, IBM will tout its efforts to build a new ecosystem of programmers and software packages on its Power processors. Hewlett-Packard will boast of its efforts to use Linux to woo customers from rival Sun Microsystems. And Sun will use Linux to showcase its new software and storage directions. Among software companies, No. 2 Linux seller Novell will launch its version 9 of its flagship product, while No. 1 Red Hat will highlight its expansion into Java server software. And Veritas will show off an upgrade that raises its Linux storage software to the same level as its Unix products. A mainstream choice Despite campaigns by rivals such as the SCO Group and Microsoft, Linux has become widely used. According to a June study by Forrester Research of 129 companies with annual revenue exceeding $500 million, 24 percent use Linux on 10 or more Intel-based servers today and 44 percent expect to do so three years from now. That's still a far cry from the 88 percent that use Windows, but it's making gains on the most popular Unix, Sun's Solaris, at 43 percent. IDC's worldwide market share shows that Windows outshipped Linux in 2003 for server operating systems, with 15 percent of the 5.6 million copies sold compared with Linux's 6.8 percent and Unix's 5 percent. But on desktop computers, Linux moved up, surpassing Apple Computer's Mac OS, said researcher Dan Kusnetzky. Linux is still not a mainstream product for desktop machines, though, he said. And Linux skills are in demand. Of the 49,000 or so jobs open at online recruiting company Dice, about 2,200 require or desire Linux skills, said Chief Executive Scot Melland. That's nearly triple the number from 12 months ago, he said. "Linux skills are one of the fastest-growing skill sets on our site." New moves There's little doubt that Linux advocates hope those numbers will increase even more. IBM, for example, wants to foster Linux advancements around its Power processor--not a common foundation for Linux compared with Intel or Advanced Micro Devices chips. At LinuxWorld, Big Blue plans to announce that schools such as the University of Portland are participating in a program to try Power-based servers and Linux; that new software companies such as StoneSoft, Acucorp, Congnos and HansaWorld are supporting the combination; and that programs will be forthcoming to encourage more such partnerships. Among the partnership programs is one in which IBM will give a business partner $5,000 in joint marketing funds for a product that involves Linux. The amount rises to $7,500 for a program involving the Power version of Linux and $10,000 if another business partner is also included in a three-way partnership called a "Valuenet." IBM set up 50 Linux Valuenets in 2003 and expects to exceed its goal of 275 this year, said Scott Handy, vice president of Linux strategy IBM. The number of Linux applications running on Power processors has doubled from 300 to 600 so far this year, he added. Rival HP has its own partnership plans. First, it will make in-house Linux training, software and information programs available to business partners, and second, it will try to coax into the Linux camp software companies that support Sun's Solaris version of Unix. "We'll identify key Solaris ISVs (independent software vendors) that have not yet ported their applications to Linux and target those folks," said Jeffrey Wade, HP's Linux marketing communications manager. And where IBM is pushing Linux on Power, HP advocates use of Intel's Itanium on the Integrity server line. Based on customer demand, HP accelerated its support for Linux on servers with eight or more Itanium chips, including its top-end Superdome servers, Wade said. The support, which had been scheduled to arrive half a year from now, will begin with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and extend to Novell's SuSE Linux Enterprise Server a quarter later. Sun warms to Linux Sun no longer is shunning Linux, though the company's chief operating officer, Jonathan Schwartz, still shows a strong preference for Sun's own Solaris. Nevertheless, Sun will announce at the show that some software previously available only for Solaris soon will work on Red Hat and Novell's Linux. That software is version 3 of Sun Ray Server, the software that runs on a server connected to bare-bones "thin client" desktop computers called Sun Rays. Sun Ray Server runs desktop software; currently one Sun UltraSparc-based running Solaris server is enough for about 20 desktop computers. The Linux version of the Sun Ray Server, due in the fourth quarter of 2004, will support at least the same number of Sun Rays, while adding the ability to run Linux desktop software not available on Solaris, said Benjamin Baer, a group product marketing in Sun's desktop software group. In addition, Sun will make its programming tools, called Sun Studio 9, available on Linux, said John Fanelli, senior director of marketing for Sun's Network Systems Group. Solaris is very important to Sun, but outsiders shouldn't doubt Sun's Linux commitment, Fanelli said. "The question of whether or not we're committed to supporting Linux is dwarfed by the number of product offerings Sun has today delivered into the Linux community," he said, mentioning multiple servers, the OpenOffice desktop software suite and Sun's Java Enterprise System server software. Software companies also are on board. Veritas, which is used mostly in Unix environments, is elevating the Linux version of its Storage Foundation products while lowering the price, said Ranajit Nevatia, director of the company's Linux strategy. For example, with a new clustering capability, a group of Linux computers can share access to the same file system, a crucial move in the growing trend toward databases spread over multiple computers instead of a single larger machine. In addition, Veritas will trumpet a "Linux in minutes" strategy coming with Storage Foundation 4, available now for Solaris and on Sept. 6 for Linux and IBM's AIX version of Unix. Data is stored identically on all three platforms, making it possible to move quickly information from one system from another. Later versions in 2005 will support the HP-UX version of Unix on HP's on Itanium and PA-RISC servers, he added.
1999-12-31 - Linux explodes onto the scene  In the 12 months of 1999, Linux rose from obscurity to overexposure. The year began with a bang for the upstart operating system. In January, IBM, Compaq Computer, Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard started selling systems designed for use with Linux. And the pace didn't let up. By the end of the year, four successful Linux-related initial public offerings raised hundreds of millions of dollars, at least three executives became paper billionaires and the operating system had grown from a counterculture hobby into a corporate mainstay. Linux is a modern-day clone of the Unix operating system born decades ago. It began as a project on Linus Torvalds' computer in 1991 and since then has grown to the point where the biggest computing companies typically either include it in their own product lines or take it seriously as a competitor. Red Hat, the seller of Linux instrumental in fueling this growth, embodies the history of Linux in 1999. Red Hat set the stage in 1998, securing investments from Intel and Netscape. Red Hat then led the first wave of Linux adoption, providing the technical support and a stable point of contact the computing heavyweights needed. In the spring, Red Hat then cemented the legitimacy of Linux by soliciting investments from IBM, Novell, Oracle, Compaq, SAP and Dell. For Matthew Szulik, who took over as Red Hat CEO in November, this was the single biggest event in 1999--bigger even than Red Hat's IPO in August. When the year began, Red Hat had 40 employees. Now, with the acquisition of Cygnus Solutions, Red Hat has grown tenfold to about 410, Szulik said. And some of those employees are crucial. Red Hat snapped up Alan Cox, Stephen Tweedie, David Miller and other programmers at the heart of Linux development. "We were fortunate to have folks like Alan and Stephen choosing to join us way back before it became fashionable, before there was a true value established for the Red Hat stock," Szulik said. Red Hat's IPO raised $84 million, providing serious capital for expansion and further development of Linux. It was followed by Cobalt Networks, Andover.Net and the biggest of them all, VA Linux Systems, which set a record when its stock closed at 698 percent above the IPO price in the first day of trading. None of these companies are making profits as yet. Their strategy is similar to that of the Internet companies that are more famously lacking in profitability: Stake a claim, hold an IPO to gain an unbeatable lead over competitors, then reap the profits at some undetermined point in the future. And, like a number of Net companies, profits eventually will derive not from technological products but from the necessary trappings of technology: advertising or support. Red Hat reported a net loss of $5.2 million for the six-month period ending Aug. 31. VA Linux, which specializes in Linux-tuned hardware, lost $10 million for the quarter ended Oct. 29. Andover.Net lost $5.4 million for the year ended Sept. 30. And Cobalt lost $13 million in the nine months ended Oct. 31. Being unprofitable while paying for expansion is unavoidable. "We're competing against organizations that have been in business for 20-plus years," Szulik said. And he was cagey about when the company will start focusing on profits instead of just revenues. "Our emphasis is going to continue to be on growing the top line.... We will continue to make investments and scale our business and brand." Microsoft probably stands the most to lose from ascendance of Linux. Microsoft set up Windows NT as the server operating system that would take on Unix. But while Windows NT in 1999 benefited only from bug fixes and its successor was delayed, Internet companies revived interest in Unix. And though most agree Linux is still rough around the edges, few deny it has moved ahead rapidly. Linux benefited from upgrades that made it more business-friendly, then improvements aimed at desktop use and visions from Torvalds that the next frontier would come in gadgets. While Red Hat, TurboLinux, SuSE and VA Linux Systems aimed Linux at the server, Corel fulfilled its promise to begin selling a version aimed at the Microsoft desktop stronghold. It even has the potential to be used in the world's fastest supercomputer. The extent of this seriousness is visible in the efforts of the Trillian group, a consortium working to get Linux working on Intel's upcoming 64-bit chips. Where typically Linux has lagged other operating systems that usually were ready for a new chip arrival, the Trillian project, newly beefed up, aims to have a 64-bit Linux for Intel ready by the time the Itanium chip arrives in 2000. Microsoft has been ambivalent toward Linux. In March, a spokesman denied that Linux is a threat, and in April, Microsoft chief executive Bill Gates predicted Linux would have a limited impact. At the same time, however, Microsoft has established and augmented its efforts to study and counter Linux. Microsoft also tried to argue that Linux posed a competitive threat in arguments to a federal judge that Microsoft doesn't hold monopoly power. The judge was unconvinced, though, saying Linux doesn't yet compete in the desktop market where Microsoft is strongest. Linux companies, many of whom are motivated by the possibility of taking Microsoft down a peg, were delighted by the judge's finding that Microsoft is a monopoly. Meanwhile, Linux has been expanding its turf while Windows NT contracts. Since the Windows NT debut, Microsoft has abandoned plans to have it run on Mips, PowerPC, and Compaq Alpha chips, NT now has a future only on Intel processors. Linux has gone the other direction. It began on Intel chips and has expanded to all other major chips with corporate help. Compaq hopes Linux will boost Alpha sales. HP is quietly funding efforts to bring Linux to its own PA-RISC chips. Even Sun Microsystems, a tepid supporter of Linux, has begun selling Red Hat for its UltraSparc-based computers. Intel, though, is among the most aggressive boosters of Linux. It led the field with its investment in Red Hat, and now has invested in Red Hat competitors SuSE and TurboLinux. It invested in hardware makers too, VA Linux Systems in March and eSoft in November. Linux connections have been the Midas touch for companies such as Applix, K-tel and V-One and Corel. But will Linux popularity become too much of a good thing? LinuxOne, which filed its IPO plans in September when its first Linux product just entered beta testing, hopes not. Despite the fact that large sections of its Securities and Exchange Commission filings are identical to similar documents from Red Hat, that it has zero revenue, and that it has sparked continuing animosity from the Linux community, LinuxOne plans to go public as soon as January.

2002-10-05 - Linux company plans Windows move   SWsoft, whose Virtuozzo software lets several copies of Linux run simultaneously on the same Intel server, plans to expand its reach next year. The company will announce next week plans to improve its software so it works on Itanium, Intel's new high-end chip family that is able to support much larger amounts of memory than Pentium and Xeon products. What's more, SWsoft plans to work its software for the Windows market. The South San Francisco, Calif.-based SWsoft expects to release its Itanium product in the first or second quarter of 2003, said Craig Oda, vice president of business development. The Windows version is due in the first half of 2003. SWsoft has an early-access agreement with Intel that allows the company to test new technology. The company also is working to formalize a marketing agreement, spokesman Alex Plant said. Similar to established competitors VMware and newcomer Connectix, SWsoft is trying to tap the trend of "server consolidation," in which jobs previously handled by several separate servers are rolled into a single physical machine, divided into separate partitions. It's an idea that's deeply embedded into mainframe computers, maturing in Unix servers, but still quite new with Intel servers. Servers are heavy-duty computers that handle round-the-clock tasks such as routing e-mail or housing inventory databases. Servers using Intel processors typically use the Linux or Windows operating systems and run less demanding tasks. SWsoft bills its software in particular for running Web servers, machines that host Web sites. While Linux running the Apache Web server is commonly used to house Web sites, many customers also use Microsoft Windows and its Web server, Internet Information Server. "Having a Windows product significantly increases the size of the market you can address," said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. "Apache and IIS are battling it out in terms of market share." There are technical challenges for SWsoft moving from Linux to Windows. Linux is an open-source project, meaning programmers can examine its code core. Windows is not so transparent. "I would think that would make the task significantly more difficult," Haff said. Oda said that Microsoft publicizes interfaces for the heart of Windows, though. "You can plug into it at a deep level," he said. SWsoft's Itanium push has only modest appeal, Haff said, given that Itanium adoption still is slow and that few look to the high-end processor for lower-end jobs such as basic Web hosting. SWsoft's approach doesn't actually run several copies of Linux on the same server. It runs one, but the company's software makes it available to users as several independent copies, each of which can be customized and restarted independently. The approach has some advantages and disadvantages, compared with VMware's software which runs actual independent "virtual machines." One advantage is there's no management layer that serves to abstract the actual hardware from the virtual machines, an approach that means greater efficiency and therefore better performance. A disadvantage, though, is that if the core operating system crashes, "the entire house of cards is going to come tumbling down," Haff said. Virtual machine technology of this type is difficult, particularly for servers whose owners are intolerant of crashes. VMware, which got its start with workstations, has seen its server efforts boosted by its partnership with IBM, which is seeking to beef up its Intel servers. SWsoft customers include Stanford University and Web hosting site Hostmania.
2002-06-28 - Linux company backs AMD chips  MandrakeSoft will sell a version of its Linux operating system that supports Advanced Micro Devices' coming 64-bit Athlon and Opteron processors, MandrakeSoft said Thursday. AMD's 64-bit chips are an extension to current 32-bit models such as Intel's Pentium or AMD's current Athlon products, but the design competes with a very different approach Intel is taking with its 64-bit Itanium family. Mandrake is working to port its product to the 64-bit processors, and the software will be able to run both 32-bit and 64-bit Linux programs, the company said. The new Mandrake Linux 9 for 64-bit AMD processors is expected to go on sale by the beginning of 2003.
2000-12-21 - Linux companies beat Microsoft in Itanium support  A version of Microsoft Windows for Intel's upcoming high-end Itanium chip won't be available when the chip arrives, but rival operating system Linux will. Itanium is scheduled to ship in the first half of 2001, but a new version of Windows tailored for the chip won't arrive until the second half, Intel and Microsoft representatives said. Meanwhile, compatible production versions of Linux from Red Hat, Turbolinux and Caldera Systems are scheduled to debut at the same time as the chip itself, the Linux companies said. The implications for corporate reputations are probably greater than the financial effects of the Windows lag, however. Itanium, its operating systems, and applications such as databases all are considered evaluation versions not yet ready for production use. "Maybe from a marketing standpoint it sounds very good to say (Microsoft has) the same functions as the big boys. Except not too many people are really going to be able to use it," said Robert Frances Group analyst Cal Braunstein. Corporate customers already are having a difficult time justifying the cost of moving to Windows 2000, a minor step compared with the switch to a totally new chip. The slipped Windows schedule contradicts the words of Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer, who told CNET News.com in a September interview that Windows would ship at the same time as the chip. "We'll have a release that's very solid," Ballmer said, adding, "I suspect we'll do some stuff even after that to put a final shine on it." He also said the initial versions would be sent only to computer manufacturers, while a retail release would wait until Whistler, the successor to Windows 2000. Itanium, though arriving later and slower than expected, is still a critical chip for Intel's future. The new CPU is intended to spearhead Intel's attempt to convert its dominance in desktop computers and low-end servers into success in high-end systems built with CPUs from Sun Microsystems, IBM, SGI and Compaq Computer. Itanium will be Intel's first 64-bit CPU, a feature that will allow computers running on it to contain vast databases in memory and speed some mathematical calculations. Competing chips from Compaq and others have been 64-bit for years. To take advantage of Itanium, though, software must be rebuilt not only for the 64-bit architecture but also for the new language the chips speak. While Itanium chips will come with circuitry that enables them to run software written for current 32-bit Intel chips, the real benefits of the chip come only when the software speaks Itanium's native tongue. The new chip hasn't been easy for Intel. Hewlett-Packard, which invented the underlying architecture of Itanium, originally expected the chip to debut in the mid- to late-1990s, according Dick Lampman, leader of the project. Intel hoped to release the chip in 1999 but has delayed it twice since then. And even the most recent delay to the first half of 2001 hasn't been final. Rick Rudd, product manager for IBM's line of IntelliStation workstations, said Tuesday he expected Itanium computers to debut in late March, but sources familiar with Intel's recent plans say the plan is for a May release. Regardless, that's sooner than Windows for Itanium will arrive. The release of 64-bit versions of Windows will come in the second half of 2001, at the same time as the release of Whistler, a spokeswoman said. The release of Whistler and accompanying 64-bit Windows for Itanium will be broken into two stages, one for desktop versions and a later one for server versions, the spokeswoman said. Both stages will be in the second half of 2001. Linux companies, naturally, see a chance to attack their biggest rival. Linux has a lead over Windows because its collaborative programming model is open to anyone and is more flexible than Microsoft's proprietary methods, said Craig Oda, vice president of alliances and product marketing at Turbolinux. Linux has been running for years on 64-bit chips, notably Compaq's Alpha, he added. Turbolinux is shipping a developer's release of Linux for Itanium already and will ship a production version when the new systems arrive, Oda said. Red Hat spokeswoman Melissa London and Caldera Systems spokeswoman Nancy Pomeroy said their companies' versions will be available when Itanium ships as well. Microsoft will also have test versions of 64-bit Windows available at that time, the Microsoft spokeswoman said.
2006-12-09 - Lampman to leave HP Labs next year Dick Lampman, head of HP Labs, will retire in 2007 after a 35-year career at the company, Hewlett-Packard announced Friday. Lampman has been in charge of HP's advanced research group since 1999. He has been part of HP Labs in various capacities since 1981, after joining the company in 1971, HP said in a press release. Dick Lampman The highest-profile--or perhaps most notorious--project born from Lampman's efforts was the Itanium processor, once envisioned as a powerful path to 64-bit computing but now mostly relevant as a replacement for the PA-RISC and Alpha processors used in HP's high-end servers. HP co-developed Itanium with Intel, but it has since handed off virtually all the future design and development to the chip specialist. Lampman also made an integral contribution to HP's work to define utility computing, a company representative said. This project was brought to light through the company's Adaptive Enterprise campaign. Lampman also oversaw much of HP's work in recent years on nanotechnology and advanced transistor research. He will remain at his post while a replacement is found and will remain for a short while after a hiring to help with the transition, the HP representative said. When Lampman joined HP Labs, it was considered the destination of choice for smart, enterprising engineers in Northern California. But those days have passed, as companies like Google have emerged, and HP Labs, which turned 40 years old this year, doesn't have quite the same stature it once held within the technology community.

2001-12-21 - Itanium's rocky road to stardom    Intel's Itanium processor is a brilliant piece of engineering. There's also a remote possibility that it could wind up as the world's next Dymaxion. The Dymaxion was a three-wheeled car invented by R. Buckminster Fuller, the technological visionary who also promoted the geodesic dome and sixties-style furniture. The Dymaxion could turn tighter than conventional cars, had a rear engine and a steering tail fin. It crashed on its public debut in 1933. In a similar vein, Itanium stands on the cusp of greatness, which, unfortunately, is located near the banana peel of disaster. The chip features an architecture that's entirely different from that found in current Intel processors. It gets rid of old clutter, and proponents tout its high performance at low cost. But are PC makers and corporate customers ready to switch? Itanium, a 64-bit processor co-designed by Intel and Hewlett-Packard, will run in servers and supercomputers containing anywhere from four to over 1,000 processors. Ideally, the chip will provide performance increases and bring PC-like economics to a market where prices typically start at $100,000. Despite massive investments in R&D and industry evangelism by Intel, however, all is not working according to plan. Originally due in the mid- to late 90s, a series of delays pushed the release of the first version of the chip, code-named Merced, to May 2001. And partly because of the delays and partly because of performance, Merced became a test vehicle for McKinley, coming out over the first half of 2002. While McKinley is expected to outperform and outsell the first version of Itanium, Intel faces another problem: inertia. Few applications exist for the chip and computer makers say demand will take off only gradually. The issue centers on the chip's architecture. Intel chips have been based around the X86 instruction set, which is essentially the language of a chip. But Itanium uses the EPIC instruction set. The only two companies that have been able to successfully switch instruction sets are IBM, with the Power chip, and Digital, with the fading Alpha. For that reason, most companies merely continue to enhance their first versions. Intel also experienced these sorts of difficulties before. In the early 1980's, the company's top designers were working on a 32-bit successor to the 16-bit 286 chip, code-named Sierra. Sierra would have featured an entirely new instruction set. The "B" team was given the assignment to come out with a 32-bit chip with the X86 instruction set but Sierra never saw the light of day. Pat Gelsinger, leader of that B team, is now the company's chief technology officer. What might Intel do in this situation? How about coming out with a 64-bit chip that used the X86 instruction set? Such a chip would be compatible with existing software, and therefore easy for manufacturers and customers to adopt. It would also be easy to pull off. In fact, early on, Intel contemplated this option, according to sources. Such a project would also effectively kill the appeal of Hammer, a 64-bit chip from Advanced Micro Devices that uses the X86 instruction set. "My biggest fear is that Intel will come out with a 32-bit processor with 64-bit extensions because it is the right thing to do," said AMD CEO Jerry Sanders in November. "The Itanium, it turns out, is a niche product. We are going to have a role in the industry because we better fulfill Microsoft's needs." Some quarters within the industry are intrigued by the two-way idea. But while it's technologically feasible, Intel would find a move in this direction to be financially and intellectually gut wrenching. It would also end so many careers inside Intel that it's difficult to envision this ever coming to pass. Difficult, but not impossible. In 1996, the company declared that future chips would be paired with memory based on designs from Rambus. PC makers, analysts and others were convinced that Intel's steadfast resolve would ensure that Rambus would become the gold standard for memory. Memory makers, however, began to complain about the high costs of investing in manufacturing capabilities for Rambus. Prices failed to drop as expected, and delays piled up. DDR DRAM, an alternative almost given up for dead in 1998 and 1999, suddenly became a lot more appealing. By July 2000, Intel declared it would pair its chips with other memory, thus pushing Rambus to the fringes. As for the future? For the record, an Intel representative denied that any project is under way for a 64-bit X86 chip and that the company stands 100 percent behind Itanium. "I expect at some point in the future they will do sort of expansion on the 32-bit," said microprocessor analyst Kevin Krewell. But it won't be an easy decision, not after Intel's investment of hundreds of millions into the program. "They are going to keep pushing that rock up the hill until they can't. Then they will fall back. "
2005-01-05 - Itanium--one step forward one back Intel allies Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft have some good and bad news for the chipmaker's Itanium 2 processor family. Hewlett-Packard is due to bring the fastest Itanium 2 processor so far to its higher-end server models on Jan. 18, sources familiar with the products said. But at the same time, Microsoft has scrapped its version of Windows for workstations using the high-end chip. Microsoft will continue to sell Itanium versions of Windows for servers, a representative said, but for the powerful desktop computers known as workstations, the company is concentrating its energies on its "x64" operating system--the one that takes advantage of 64-bit memory extensions in Intel's Xeon and Pentium and in Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron and Athlon processors. Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is due to ship in the first half of the year. The move isn't a major surprise: Itanium co-inventor Hewlett-Packard was the sole computer maker selling Itanium-based workstations, and it discontinued the product line in 2004. But it is a setback for the processor family, which is technologically well-suited to workstation tasks such as chip design, digital animation or aerodynamics analysis. The basic problem is that 64-bit x86 chips such as Xeon and Opteron are cheaper, said Pund-IT analyst Charles King. "Intel's plan is to reach price parity between Itanium and Xeon by 2007. This is one of those situations where this particular piece of the market doesn't have two years to wait," King said. Intel spokeswoman Erica Fields wouldn't say whether the company would have preferred that Itanium remain viable for workstations, but she did say Xeon is well-suited to the market. "Itanium just wasn't a strong play in the workstation market," Fields said. "Itanium is really focused on the high-end server market." Microsoft has several server software products in the works for Itanium. Among them are the Visual Studio 2005 programming tools, the .Net Framework 2005 foundation for server programs, and the SQL Server 2005 database software, the company said in a statement. HP initiated the Itanium project in 1988 in great secrecy. The company believed that the general design of today's high-end processors, called reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, would run out of steam. Over the last 10 years, HP has been gradually transferring the project to Intel. However, product delays and difficulties bringing software to the processor family have hampered its debut, and competing chip families such as IBM's Power and Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc haven't been swept aside. HP remains firmly committed to Itanium servers, though, pledging a three-year, $3 billion commitment in research and marketing for its Integrity server line. One part of that commitment will appear Jan. 18 when HP brings new top-end Itanium processors to midrange Integrity servers with eight or 16 processor sockets and to its high-end Integrity Superdome line with 32 or 64 sockets. (HP can fit as many as 128 Itanium processors in a Superdome by use of a technology called mx2 that lets a special package of two Itanium 2 processors fit into a single socket.) The systems will be available with the newest Itanium 2, which comes with 9MB of high-speed cache memory instead of the earlier 6MB version, sources said. Intel announced the chip in November. An HP representative declined to confirm or deny the server plans. Several server makers sell Itanium machines, including Silicon Graphics, Unisys, IBM, Dell, NEC and Fujitsu. But HP has the strongest dependency on Itanium, which is vital to simplifying the company's high-end server plans. HP is phasing out its PA-RISC chips that power servers using its HP-UX version of Unix. A single Itanium server can run not just HP-UX and Windows, but also Linux, and soon, HP's rarely used but highly regarded OpenVMS operating system that currently runs on another chip family headed for extinction, Alpha. Finally, HP is moving its super-high-end NonStop line from MIPS processors to Itanium. But Itanium failed to meet Intel's 2004 shipment goals. The chipmaker shipped more than 100,000 in 2003 but didn't successfully double that in 2004. "What seems to me to have been happening over the last 18 months is the increasing trend of retrenching Itanium into a smaller, higher-end section of the market," King said. "The smaller the market, the longer it's going to take to recoup all those investment dollars they put into Itanium in the first place."
2002-10-01 - Itanium-Linux group drafts new members Two new members have joined the Gelato Federation, a group sponsored by Hewlett-Packard to improve research software for computers using Intel's Itanium processor and the Linux operating system. One new member is CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, a longtime tester of Itanium Linux systems. The other is National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), which conducts research on issues such as global warming. HP helped Intel develop the Itanium family and has a strong vested interest in its success. The chip is the foundation for all HP's future high-end computer systems. Other Gelato members include the BioInformatics Institute in Singapore, Groupe ESIEE in France, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in Illinois, Tsinghua University in China, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of New South Wales in Australia and the University of Waterloo in Canada.
2002-01-30 - Itanium to take on Alpha influence Compaq Computer's Alpha chip may be heading toward the periphery of the market, but its influence will live on in versions of Intel's Itanium chip coming out in 2004 and beyond. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel is readying two new versions of its Itanium chip--code-named Montecito and Chivano--that will incorporate concepts from the Alpha architecture, according to sources. Montecito will likely come out in 2004, while Chivano will probably appear in 2005 or 2006. The Alpha influence in these chips comes as a result of a deal last June between Intel and Compaq under which Intel acquired a license for the intellectual property for Alpha and hired more than 100 engineers from the Alpha team. The deal helped pave the way for the Compaq-HP merger, according to some analysts. With the agreement, Compaq said it would begin to fade out the line gradually. Intel declined to comment, citing a policy to not discuss unannounced products. Alpha in some ways has been the noble experiment of the processor world. While highly regarded for its performance and underlying technology, the chip--and servers containing it--never achieved a strong position in the market. Instead, Alpha servers were consistently outsold by Unix servers containing chips from Sun Microsystems and IBM. Digital Equipment designed the chip, but the Alpha family was transferred to Compaq in 1998 when Compaq acquired Digital. "Alpha is one of the quintessential examples of a great technology failing to get its fair share of the market," said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64, who analogized it to Sony's Betamax. "In the long haul, it makes Itanium more attractive by injecting that technological talent." Itanium is the line of server processors from Intel. Unlike conventional Pentium chips, which digest data in 32-bit chunks, Itanium handles data in 64-bit chunks and can manage far more memory at once. As a result, it can be used in computers to run large databases. The chip, however, was delayed for years and has sold sparingly since it was released in May 2001. The extent of the Alpha influence on the planned chips is unclear. Montecito and Chivano could both include architectural features embodied in current Alpha processors, according to some sources. More likely, the two chips could merely reflect some of the technological themes or ideas that appear in Alpha. Adopting Alpha Either way, sources say the two chips will bear some sort of Alpha stamp. Intel executives have already said that the newly hired Alpha engineers will help Intel in developing compilers, software that helps navigate the chasm between the machine code of a chip and abstract software code. The chips will appear in high-end servers. Montecito is positioned to be a successor to Madison, which itself is a successor to McKinley, a new version of Itanium coming out toward the middle of the year. Madison is expected to come out in 2003 and run between 1.2GHz and 1.6GHz, according to sources. Like Madison, Montecito will be made using the 130-nanometer manufacturing process, the process currently used for Intel's fastest notebook and desktop chips. McKinley will come out on the 180-nanometer process. Montecito will likely contain new features that aren't in the cards for Madison. For instance, Intel has said it will incorporate hyperthreading, a technology emerging on Xeon chips in a few weeks that can enhance performance. Hyperthreading allows software programs to use different parts of the chip at once, hence speeding up the amount of time it takes to accomplish a given set of tasks. Alpha engineers planned to incorporate a variant of hyperthreading into Alpha, Brookwood noted. "Fundamentally, once somebody comes up with a performance-enhancing feature in one architecture, it becomes relatively straightforward to move it to other architectures," Brookwood said. While it remains unclear, Chivano could come out on the 95-nanometer process, as Intel is expected to start coming out with processors sporting 95-nanometer circuits in 2005. Chips made on the 95-nanometer process will be smaller and faster than 130-nanometer chips--just as 130-nanometer chips are smaller than their 180-nanometer kin. If Chivano in fact comes out on the 95-nanometer process, it could contain a number of new features. Intel has said it will likely come out with a version of Itanium with two processor cores, or two fully functional chips on one piece of silicon. Researchers at the company have also said that it won't be economically practical to come out with dual-core chips, such as IBM's Power 4, until the 95-nanometer manufacturing era. Hyperthreading may also not make its debut in the Itanium line until Chivano, one source speculated. Ironically, Digital sued Intel in 1997, claiming the company had infringed its intellectual property with regard to Alpha. The two giants settled the case early on. As part of the settlement, Intel acquired Digital's Hudson, Mass., fabrication facility where Alpha was made at the time and the intellectual property to the StrongArm chip line. Alpha engineers have also been behind some of Intel's toughest competitors. Dirk Meyer and Fred Weber, the two chief technologists behind Advanced Micro Devices' Athlon and upcoming Hammer chips, are Alpha alumni.
2001-05-22 - Itanium to largely skip telecom market Itanium-based servers for the telecommunications market will be largely symbolic until the arrival of the chip's successor. Despite multiple delays and the stringent requirements of much of its target market, Intel still says its Itanium processor launch this year will be one of the biggest introductions of its kind. But a senior executive admitted that telecommunications companies and other businesses won't be tempted to switch their existing 64-bit systems over to IA-64 until next year. The chip giant is in the midst of launching the first IA-64 chip, Itanium, for workstations and servers--and now for telecommunications servers. But Gordon Graylisch, Intel's director of e-business and communications solutions, admitted on Friday that for telecom users, Itanium will mainly be used as a development technology for IA-64 while companies wait for Itanium's successor, McKinley, next year. "With McKinley people will start taking existing environments and moving them over," said Graylisch. He said Itanium will mainly be bought by companies that happen to be in the market for new servers and workstations and are interested in the new technology. "But I don't see that as particularly limiting for Itanium," he said. Intel is entering unfamiliar territory with its move into servers for the telecommunications industry. Such servers face far more strict reliability requirements, which will make it even more difficult for Intel to sell the brand-new and untested Itanium processor. The market is now dominated by the likes of Sun Microsystems, which is also a major player in the high-end servers Intel originally designed IA-64 to run. Intel's main selling point is the notion that IA-64 will be one of the few platforms that will be running high-end servers and that it could eventually also become the standard for lower-end servers, desktop PCs, and even mobile and embedded devices. Because of Intel's massive manufacturing base, Itanium is also far less expensive than its competitors. Graylisch said Itanium's release will be "small by PC standards," but it will be "one of the strongest introductions from anybody." Industry analysts believe that Itanium's multiple delays have partly damaged its attractiveness by giving it a short shelf life before it is replaced. "The first version will get a very respectable rollout, and people will be deploying around that," Graylisch said. "McKinley makes it an absolute no-brainer." Staff writer Matthew Broersma reported from London.
2001-05-11 - Itanium to arrive at last  It's been a long, strange trip, but the first servers and workstations containing Intel's Itanium chip will start to hit the market in a few weeks at prices a bit lower than expected. Intel will release the long-awaited--and oft-delayed--chip at the end of May, according to sources, and most computer companies plan to come out with their products around the same time. IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Dell Computer and other large computer manufacturers will soon unveil two-, four- and even 16-processor computers containing the 64-bit Itanium chip for the first time. The chip, and computers containing it, will compete against more expensive Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) servers and workstations from Sun Microsystems, IBM and HP. Along with processors running at 800MHz and 733MHz, the Itanium boxes will tout such features as 32GB of memory--enough to store entire Web sites--and fairly large hard drives. While it's unclear how well these computers will perform in benchmark performance tests against the established RISC aristocracy, it appears that some Itanium computers could cost slightly less than earlier anticipated. Last year, initial price lists indicated that the chip would range in cost from $4,227 for an 800MHz Itanium with 4MB of performance-enhancing tertiary cache to over $3,500 for a 733MHz Itanium with 2MB of tertiary cache. While the 4MB version will cost the same, the lower-end models will cost less. For workstations, Itaniums running at 733MHz and containing 2MB of cache memory will sell for between $1,000 and $2,000, or in the range of Intel's current Xeon chips. Judging by Intel's pricing history, the 800MHz Itanium with 2MB cache will likely have a similar price. As a result, workstations will cost more than traditional Intel boxes "but somewhat less than a comparable RISC workstation," said Rick Rudd, product line manager for the Intellistation workstation line at IBM. Still, there won't be lot Meta Group says Intel's 64-bit Itanium chip is a major competitive threat to high-end RISC/Unix workstations and servers--but this threat will take some time to develop. see commentary  of Itanium computers to choose from. A series of glitches have pushed back the chip from mid-1999 until now, and that's on top of a fairly long development period. Consequently, most companies are now concentrating on building computers for McKinley, a second, more powerful version of Itanium, which will start appearing in pilot projects at the end of the year. "Every vendor's plans have changed considerably. We had much more aggressive plans 18 months ago," said Jay Bretzmann, product marketing manager for IBM's X series of servers. "It makes a lot more sense to shift development and focus to McKinley." Software applications are also limited. "The 64-bit platform will really hit its stride next year," Rudd said. Product selection, therefore, will be comparatively limited. Compaq, for instance, will come out with Itanium servers this year, according to sources at that company, but hold off on workstations until 2002. HP will come out with two servers, a four-processor server and a 16-way box codeveloped with NEC, as well as at least one workstation. "Our expectation is that this (release of Itanium-based products) will be for early adopters," said Mark Hudson, worldwide marketing manager in the business systems and technology organization at HP. "They will be (priced) significantly higher than typical (Intel) servers but less than a RISC offering," Hudson added. Despite the relatively limited introduction, the Itanium presence will grow as the year goes on. At the end of 2002, HP will start putting Itanium into "Superdome," its 32-processor RISC machine. Superdome pricing starts at a lofty $1 million. Eventually, HP's Intel-based server line and the server line containing its PA-RISC chip will merge, Hudson said. At that point, HP will primarily be marketing one server family, and the main decision for the customer will be which operating system to select. IBM will come out with a single two-processor workstation and one four-processor server. The company's Itanium Intellistation will contain two 800MHz Itaniums with 2MB of cache, up to 16GB of memory and an 18.2GB or 36.2GB hard drive. IBM's Itanium server, by contrast, will contain four processors and 32GB of memory. The size of the memory banks and the huge performance boost they offer remain one of the key features of Itanium systems. "You can load up all of the Web pages on a site and never go to disk," Bretzmann said. Meanwhile, Dell is expected to come out with both servers and workstations, and Gateway will release a server. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the launch, but executives are clearly relieved the chip is finally coming out. "This is the quarter many of us have waited five or six years for," said Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel Architecture Group. Staff writer John Spooner contributed to this report.
2001-07-19 - Itanium Sun Microsystems' worst nightmare  Intel announced its Itanium processor on May 29, seven years (almost to the day) after first announcing a partnership with Hewlett-Packard to develop a family of high-end microprocessors. Although it doesn't blow the doors off the competition--as Intel had initially hoped (and hyped)--Itanium is a solid product, best viewed as the first in a long line of processors that will eventually dominate the high end of computing, pushing aside current competitors such as IBM's Power family and Sun's SPARC processors. Ever since Itanium was first revealed, there has been much controversy about its likely performance. The chip's unique architecture, which Intel and HP call EPIC, is based on VLIW technology that is fundamentally different from the RISC and CISC technology used by all other high-end processors. This technology is designed to achieve higher performance but relies heavily on the compiler (which creates Itanium code) to anticipate and plan for all possible program outcomes. Critics wondered if the compiler could be this efficient. With the Intel announcement comes the first official benchmarks on the long-awaited processor. These measurements, frankly, are a mixed bag. Itanium excels on some benchmarks and does poorly on others.Champ or chump? At least some of these shortfalls, however, do not reflect fundamental problems. Itanium does best on scientific applications with large data sets and lots of complex floating-point math. Groups such as CERN (the European particle-physics laboratory) and NCSA (National Computational Science Alliance) love what Itanium does on the most difficult computational problems in the world. On some of these problems, it significantly outperforms even the Alpha processor, widely regarded as the world's fastest chip. Itanium also does well on transaction processing and other high-end business applications. Based on preliminary TPC-C measurements, Itanium performs as well as the best available processors, including Alpha and IBM's Power. This performance is critical when running Oracle or similar database software. The chip does not do as well on general-purpose business code, such as simple Web serving. On SPECint, a popular benchmark, Itanium is 30 percent slower than the fastest processors, including Intel's own Pentium 4 and HP's PA-8700. On this type of code, Itanium is hampered by its small caches, a shortcoming which Intel plans to fix in a future version, and by the inability of the compiler to always predict what these programs will do. Intel has touted Itanium's compatibility with software that runs on its popular Xeon processors. In theory, Xeon customers can buy Itanium systems without needing to upgrade their software. In reality, customers will quickly discover that they have purchased a very slow machine. Intel won't even discuss Itanium's performance in "compatibility mode," but it is certainly slower than a Pentium 3 Xeon, much less Pentium 4. Because of these issues, I do not expect Itanium to be broadly deployed. There will be some end-user deployment in the scientific segment, but this is a low-volume segment. In the commercial segment, most businesses will purchase only a few Itanium systems for software development and testing. Broad deployment is likely to wait until the next-generation McKinley processor is available. McKinley, likely to be branded as Itanium II, is already being tested in Intel's labs and will appear in systems next year. Intel says this chip will deliver twice the performance of the original Itanium and have three times the memory speed. This big jump in performance comes from locating and uncorking several bottlenecks in the Itanium design that were not anticipated. Further performance improvements will come when McKinley is moved from a 0.18-micron process to the 0.13-micron process that Intel will begin producing later this year. The 0.13-micron McKinley, code-named Madison, will be three times faster than Itanium and is expected to appear in systems in early 2003. These rapid performance improvements will show the true value of Itanium's EPIC technology. McKinley and Madison should outperform all competitors on most benchmarks, even the troublesome SPECint. On scientific and transaction-processing code, the next-generation Itanium chips will be head and shoulders above the competition. While these chips are cleaning up the high end, Intel also plans to address lower-cost servers and workstations. The initial Itanium already has a low-cost version at a price of $1,177, low enough for some workstations. The company is developing a part code-named Deerfield that should allow pricing well below $1,000, making it suitable for even low-cost workstations and servers. This chip should appear in systems by early 2003, about the same time as Madison. Once Madison and Deerfield are in place, the Itanium line will be poised to entirely displace the current Xeon family. Thus, while Itanium will likely contribute only a few hundred million dollars to this year's top line, Itanium family revenues should exceed $6 billion by 2004. This will begin to help Intel recoup the estimated $1 billion-$2 billion that it has spent to develop Itanium. Most server vendors have adopted a two-track strategy, offering customers a choice of their proprietary architecture or the new Itanium platform. Itanium systems will be available from more than 20 vendors this year, using popular operating systems such as Windows XP, Linux and AIX. With this approach, Itanium sales should offset any cannibalization of the proprietary RISC customer base. In the Itanium space, server vendors will differentiate on the basis of system performance, availability, support and similar factors. The big loser in this transition is Sun, the only major server vendor that continues to use a single-track strategy, offering only its proprietary SPARC platforms and its proprietary Solaris operating system. Even if Sun can match the performance of the Itanium family with its SPARC processors, it won't be able to match the system-level features of 20 Itanium OEMs. With Itanium, end users will have a choice of buying from many system vendors, all selling compatible systems. With SPARC, end users must buy from a single vendor. I believe this business model will restrict Sun's business, causing a significant loss of share within two to three years to Itanium supporters such as HP, IBM and Compaq Computer. The company may ultimately counter by offering its own Itanium systems, but at that point, Sun will be decidedly late to the party.

2003-11-03 - Itanium software upgrade hits bump A software package that lets Intel's Itanium processors run programs that are tailored to more mainstream Pentium and Xeon chips has had its launch date bumped back from this year. The software, an Intel package called the IA32 Execution Layer (IA32-EL for short), was scheduled to debut in Service Pack 1 for Microsoft's Windows Server 2003 operating system. However, the introduction of that update has been pushed back from 2003 to the second half of 2004, a Microsoft representative said Friday. Microsoft still expects to support IA32-EL when Service Pack 1 ships and plans to include the feature in all its versions of Windows for Itanium, the company said. Microsoft's schedule change means the software is likely to show up earlier in Linux. SuSE Linux plans to include it in SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 9.0, due to ship in the second quarter of 2004, according to the company's chief technology officer, Juergen Geck. However, the inclusion of the technology in SLES is contingent on Intel's revamping of the software so that it works on the coming 2.6 Linux kernel, Geck said. For example, that kernel dramatically changes how the operating system handles simultaneous tasks, or "threads." "The abstraction layer (IA32-EL) that Intel provides is very intrusive into the kernel and Glibc (a library of software routines used by Linux programs)," Geck said. "They have to port it to the new architecture...If Intel manages to make that transition smoothly, we expect to see it in SLES 9.0." Itanium is a 64-bit processor that can handle vastly larger amounts of data than can 32-bit Intel processors such as Xeon and Pentium. However, it uses a very different instruction language than do the Xeon and Pentium and can only run software that's written for those chips very slowly. IA32-EL translates the Xeon instructions into ones the Itanium can understand, and a 1.5GHz Itanium 2 will be able to run Xeon instructions at about the speed of a 1.4GHz Xeon, according to Intel. Real Xeons currently run at 3.2GHz and will likely operate faster than that by the time IA32-EL arrives. The schedule change could affect some people that need to run older software that hasn't been reworked for Itanium, but that's a comparatively small group, said Mercury Research analyst Dean McCarron. "The 32-bit execution layer is going to make Itanium run legacy code better. But if your intent is to run legacy code, you're not going to buy Itanium in the first place--you're going to buy Xeon," McCarron said. "It's not that big an impact." The Linux version of the IA32-EL software includes a combination of open-source components and proprietary components, Intel spokesman Scott McLaughlin said. (The core of Linux, called the kernel, must be open-source but sometimes includes links to proprietary modules. For example, graphics chipmaker Nvidia supplies proprietary software Linux can use.) Red Hat, the dominant seller of Linux, plans to make IA32-EL available to Red Hat Enterprise Linux customers in 2004, Intel said. Red Hat declined to comment beyond saying the company continues to work with Intel on the technology.
2005-11-14 - Itanium sinks again in supercomputers  Intel's Itanium can't seem to get a firm toehold anywhere. The Itanium chip family, which Intel has relegated to high-end servers, has rapidly declined on the Top500 Supercomputer list. In November 2004 the list had 84 computers with Itanium 2 processors. In June 2005, the number shrunk to 79. Now only 46 computers contain Itanium 2 chips, according to the latest list, released Monday. Meanwhile, the number of supercomputers using Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron chips has increased. A total of 55 Opteron-based computers made the list, up from 25 in June. (Opterons were found in just 29 computers on the November 2004 list.) The number of supercomputers using Intel's 64-bit Xeon chips grew slightly to 81 on the lastest list, from 79 in June. The chips only came to the market a year ago. Although the list is fluid and changes considerably every few months, Itanium's dip on the list is bad news for Intel. The decline could reinforce the gloom that surrounds the chip and be seen as a harbinger that computer architects are losing interest in it. An Intel representative cautioned about reading too much into the numbers. A new, albeit delayed, version of Itanium 2, code-named Montecito, is coming soon, which could reinvigorate Itanium's position. "Overall Intel's presence on the list remains strong. We remain the predominant processor provider on the list," the representative said. The company's processors run 333 of the top 500 machines. "It is more symbolic than anything else, but the top 500 does give you an insight into where the mainstream architecture is going," said Gordon Haff, an analyst at the Illuminata research firm. "When there so many questions raised around Itanium, there is more of a tendency to take a glass-is-half-empty point of view." The decline of Itanium can be chalked up to a few factors, Haff stated. Silicon Graphics, a major backer of Itanium, is having difficulties. And Hewlett-Packard, which helped design Itanium, has been shifting its weight to Opteron; in fact, many of the new Opteron systems on the list come from HP. Itanium hasn't had a strong fit with how researchers are building supercomputers, Haff said. The chip is best suited for heavyweight clusters, which consist of servers containing 4, 8, 16 or more processors each. However, system architects now prefer to build large clusters from more lightweight servers with one to two processors connected to each other over high speed links. The Itanium saga can be seen as a tale of soaring ambition vs. commercial practicality. In the late '80s, Intel and HP outlined plans for Itanium, in part to correct some of the limitations of the x86 chip architecture, which was the basis for Intel's chips at the time. The new Itanium chip would also allow Intel to get into the market for server chips. By the mid-'90s, however, Intel improved the performance of its x86 chips themselves; in fact, the company enhanced the older chips enough to start selling them to server makers. In a few years, the company's market share of server chips went from under 3 percent to over 80 percent. And, during that time, Itanium suffered delays. The first version suffered from performance problems. Subsequent versions improved on performance, but customers and developers remained lukewarm about taking on the task of converting their software applications to run on Itanium. By 2003, Itanium prospects began improving. In June of that year, 19 of the top 500 supercomputers ran on Itanium, a figure that jumped to 32 by November. But then AMD introduced its Opteron chip, which weakened one of Itanium's big advantages--running 64-bit software and enabling computers to contain tremendous amounts of memory. Opteron runs 32-bit software, found on desktops, as well as 64-bit software. Intel followed with its 64-bit Xeon chip. Over the years, Intel began to circumscribe Itanium's potential market. The company planned to sell the chip for a wide variety of servers and workstations. Then Dell and HP dropped Itanium workstations, so Intel stopped plugging it for those tasks. At the same time, Itanium went from being a server chip to only a high-end server chip. Sales remained low. "With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, there would not be an Itanium today," Haff said.
2002-08-29 - Itanium seen trailing rivals in 2007   Sales of servers based around Intel's Itanium chips will grow, but they will still lag behind today's established leaders five years from now, according to research firm Gartner. By 2007, yearly revenue from servers running Itanium processors, a 64-bit family of chips for high-end servers that typically run four or more processors, will come to approximately $4 billion, according to Gartner analyst Jeff Hewitt. By contrast, servers running UltraSparc, the competing chip family from Sun Microsystems, will account for $6.6 billion. Revenue from IBM machines using the Power processor will total $8.6 billion, Hewitt said. Although it may be third in 64-bit servers, Intel is expected to wield increasing influence through the sale of its processors for smaller machines. The rising popularity of its 32-bit server chips, which are essentially beefed up versions of the processors found in desktops and notebooks, will account for $27 billion in sales in 2007, Hewitt projects. The projections underscore current shifts in the server world. IBM, which has latched onto Linux and unveiled an ambitious processor strategy for its server and mainframe line, continues to inch up in terms of market share. The company accounted for 29.6 percent of worldwide server revenue in the second quarter, making it the largest company in terms of revenue, Gartner said. Servers containing AIX, IBM's version of Unix, will likely pass sales of servers from Hewlett-Packard running HP-UX by late this year or early next year, Hewitt said. Sun, meanwhile, has recovered to some degree from the extreme dip it experienced in 2001. Itanium, though, has yet to completely find its footing. Only 722 servers containing Itanium or Itanium 2 processors were shipped in the second quarter. "That's about $17 million in business," Hewitt said, a small portion of the overall market. Last year, 2,716 Itanium servers were shipped, but the total figure included two 1,000-server clusters, Hewitt said. Looking for a spark Part of Itanium's gradual growth can be attributed to the glacial nature of the market. Customers are loath to try out new big-iron machines, especially now with tightening IT budgets, several analysts and executives have said. "I don't think there will be any significant volume until Madison and Deerfield next year," said Kevin Krewell, senior editor of Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. Madison and Deerfield are code names for future versions of Itanium set to arrive in 2003. In earlier years, McKinley, the code name of the chip that became Itanium 2, was expected to kick off volume sales. An Intel spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures or projections for Itanium sales, but acknowledged that gaining acceptance will be a long process. "We're happy with the ramp we've got going," she said. "It is a slow and steady gain." At the same time, Itanium has been subject to the political forces of the hardware market. HP, the co-developer of the chip and one of its biggest boosters, is still grappling with its just-completed merger with Compaq Computer. Dell Computer, which is quick to adopt Intel chips, has scaled back its overall Itanium efforts and has not committed to new Itanium 2 products. "Dell is the linchpin of this thing," Krewell said. Despite its sheepishness about Itanium, Dell will be crucial to Intel's push in the low end of the server market. Dell barely gained market share, in terms of revenue, in the second quarter. Yet the figure is slightly deceiving, Hewitt said, as smaller servers continue to gain popularity at the expense of the larger, more complex machines. "When you look at the broad picture, Dell continues to chip away," he said.
2001-05-30 - Itanium scores high in performance tests   Even though Intel's new Itanium chip arrived years late, some of its performance numbers have drawn qualified praise from industry analysts. Two key chip speed measurements using standards set by testing organization Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) show the 800MHz Itanium in some cases neck-in-neck with Sun Microsystems' newest UltraSparc III chip and in some cases soundly beating it. Sun is Intel's chief competitor when it comes to trying to win a place for Itanium, a chip Intel announced Tuesday. One measurement of "floating-point" mathematical calculations shows Itanium soundly beating UltraSparc III--even the delayed 900MHz version due to arrive shortly. But when it comes to more ordinary "integer" operations, Itanium is behind Sun's chip and even Intel's own Xeon server chip. "The SpecFP (floating-point) number was just phenomenal, but the SpecInt (integer) number was very weak," said MicroDesign Resources analyst Kevin Krewell. "Intel has not been able to provide a very good reason why that number was so weak." "We feel (integer performance) is competitive today with UltraSparc III, and we expect it to get better with McKinley," the second-generation Itanium model due in the first half of 2002, said Intel spokesman Seth Walker, who said Itanium shines on higher-level benchmarks such as database performance or data encryption. Itanium is the first of a new high-end line of chips from Intel that speak a totally different language from the existing low-end Celeron, mid-range Pentium and high-end Xeon lines. The existing products are 32-bit chips, but the Itanium is a 64-bit model, the key difference between the two being the ability to accommodate vast amounts of memory. Itanium vs. Sun Two key chip measurements from testing company Standard Performance Evaluation show that Intel's new 800MHz Itanium server chip is neck and neck with Sun's newest UltraSparc III chip and, in some cases, Itanium is soundly beating it. SpecInt: Measures relative speed in computing processes such as compressing a file, word processing or compiling software. Higher numbers mean greater performance. Sun UltraSparc III, 750MHz: 395 Sun UltraSparc III, 900MHz: 467 Intel Itanium, 800MHz: 404 SpecFP: Measures mathematical processes such as drawing 3D images or simulating nuclear physics. Sun UltraSparc III, 750MHz: 421 Sun UltraSparc III, 900 MHz: 482 Intel Itanium, 800MHz: 711 Sources: Intel, Standard Performance Evaluation Itanium, delayed several times from its planned arrival in the 1990s, was spawned by a collaboration between Hewlett-Packard and Intel. The chip is a key element of Intel's strategy to bring to top-end servers and workstations its philosophy of high-volume manufacturing and support from multiple computer makers. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has been largely locked out of the market, which is dominated by 64-bit chips from Sun, IBM, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and SGI. Piper Jaffray analyst Ashok Kumar believes Intel ultimately will succeed. "Itanium itself is a solid product, but it doesn't blow the doors off the competition, as Intel had initially hoped (and hyped)," Kumar wrote in a report Wednesday. "But it is best viewed as the first step in a long line of processors that will eventually dominate the high end of computing, pushing aside current competitors such as IBM's Power family and Sun's Sparc processors." Itanium beats even Compaq's lauded Alpha chip, Terry Shannon, author of the Shannon Knows Compaq newsletter, said in a note Tuesday. But Shannon predicted Alphas running at higher clock speeds--1GHz chips are expected by mid-July--"will restore Alpha's performance leadership across the board." Itanium didn't convince Shannon that its design "will doom rival architectures to near-term obsolescence." Krewell predicted IBM's coming Power4 chip, due to arrive in servers this fall, also will keep the pressure on Itanium. But delays have hampered Itanium's prospects. "If this product had come out last year, it would have been a much more impressive part," Krewell said. More than just the numbers But raw performance is just one of a host of factors Itanium faces in the marketplace. Of greater concern has been the fact that software must be completely rewritten to take advantage of Itanium's performance. Although older software designed for the earlier 32-bit chips will run, Itanium performance on such tasks is dismal. The situation hasn't escaped Sun's notice. "We think that this announcement actually enhances our competitiveness because it highlights the transitions that customers and vendors need to go through with the Itanium," said said Nancy Weintraub, director of marketing for system products at Sun. Customers must recompile their software for the new chip and re-certify it for the new systems, she said, whereas Sun customers are guaranteed that software written for earlier UltraSparc chips will run unmodified on the UltraSparc III. Intel and its business partners have only just begun the laborious process of getting software ready for Itanium. The first version of Microsoft's Windows XP for Itanium workstations isn't expected until Oct. 25, and higher-level software such as databases likely will arrive even later. "We do not expect Itanium to be broadly deployed," Kumar said. Though some scientific users will buy the systems, "most businesses will purchase only a few Itanium systems for software development and testing." Intel is girding for a struggle with Sun and others that could go on for years, though. Broader use will come with the second-generation McKinley chip due in systems a year from now. And another successor, code-named Madison and due in early 2003, is expected to be three times faster than the first Itanium, Kumar said. Though introducing a totally new design is very hard on programmers and customers who must totally rewrite software, Sun and others will see their designs run out of steam and likely will have to take the drastic step Intel took when moving to the Itanium, Krewell said. "At some point in time, you've got to break the previous architecture and start from scratch," Krewell said. "I think the UltraSparc architecture is getting old." Intel has pushed its comparatively ancient 32-bit designs remarkably far, though, and Weintraub defended Sun's design. "We feel very strongly about the longevity of the Sparc chip," Weintraub said.
2001-12-11 - Itanium sales off to a slow start  It's going to be a long haul for Itanium, Intel's new server chip. Intel spent nearly 10 years and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop Itanium, but the first version of the chip has faced slow sales so far. In the third quarter--the first full quarter of Itanium sales--manufacturers sold just $13.7 million worth of servers containing the chip, which comes to less than 500 servers, according to market researcher IDC. By contrast, Gartner research shows that 2,601 Itanium servers were shipped in the third quarter, an increase over the three shipped in the second quarter. The discrepancy between the IDC and Gartner figures apparently comes from the fact that companies have shipped many Itanium servers for demonstration purposes. The Itanium's humble start, while not completely unexpected, underscores the immense challenges that lie ahead for Intel, allied computer manufacturers and software developers that are gunning to make Itanium the standard for complex computing in the next decade. Intel says it isn't disappointed with the sales numbers. "We're pleased with the acceptance of Itanium to date," a company representative said Tuesday, adding that sales should increase once Compaq Computer, one of largest server manufacturers, starts selling computers with the chip. Ambitious beginnings Itanium, one of the most ambitious launches in Intel's history, is designed to run large databases and complex applications such as those that simulate weather patterns and require expensive RISC/Unix servers from the likes of Sun Microsystems or IBM. Ideally for Intel, Itanium servers will become cheaper, more powerful and will contain wider array of software than they do now. The chip contains an entirely new architecture that processes data in 64-bit chunks, rather than 32 bits like standard Intel chips. As a result, computer makers must design entirely new computers for the chip, while software developers must spend time and effort to make their existing applications compatible. The problem is most of this work isn't complete yet, and as a result, sales of servers remain low. "This is going to be an incredibly long ramp," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. "We expected it to do a little better, but not a lot better." Added Hugh Jenkins, vice president of marketing in Compaq's industry standard server group: "It is going to take a couple of years for the operating systems and applications to be made available...and for customers to tune their own applications." Jenkins sees 2003 and 2004 as the "real prime time of 64-bit applications." Itanium has also been hurt by a slow economy and delays. Originally due in the mid- to late 1990s, the first version of the Itanium, code-named Merced, finally came out at the end of May. Partly because of the delays and partly because of performance issues, Merced has largely become a test vehicle for future versions of the Itanium. The next version, code-named McKinley, will be more powerful than Merced. McKinley is set to come out in test systems in the first part of next year and commercially toward the middle of 2002. Madison, an improved version of McKinley, is expected to arrive in 2003, along with a low-power budget version of the chip, code-named Deerfield. With McKinley, sales are expected to begin picking up. By the third quarter of next year, McCarron predicts that Intel could be selling a "couple hundred thousand (chips) a quarter." But the expense involved in making McKinley--along with other factors--could keep sales of the upcoming chip moderate too. Kevin Krewell, an analyst at MicroDesign Resources, predicted that the company will sell around 100,000 Itanium chips per quarter by the end of 2002. By contrast, the Pentium Pro, Intel's first server chip, was selling 500,000 units a quarter after four quarters. And its Xeon chip went from zero to 500,000 units in four quarters. These chips, though, had smaller price tags than Itanium. One of the reasons for McKinley's bigger price tag, Krewell said, is that it will cover nearly 440 square millimeters in area--or more than twice that of the Pentium 4. "One problem is that McKinley...is expensive to manufacture. It also means yields are lower," he said. "Not until you get into Madison and Deerfield in 2003 do you start talking about volume." The Intel representative, however, countered Krewell's assertions. Size is somewhat irrelevant when it comes to server chips, the representative said, because of the much higher cost of servers. McKinley will be larger than Merced, he said, but the additional space allows the chip to contain more cache memory and computing units. Competition at home? Ironically, one of Itanium's biggest competitors won't be Sun, but the Xeon line itself. Xeon already sells well and is compatible with existing software. Customers are also sold on Xeon. Glenn Bonner, chief information officer of Mirage Resorts, noted in an interview last month that Xeon-based machines can effectively handle most corporate computing tasks. A new version of Xeon for four- and eight-processor servers is coming in the first quarter. The chip will run at 1.5GHz and 1.6GHz, according to sources, and contain Hyper Threading, a new technology that can increase performance up to 30 percent by using internal computing elements of the chip more efficiently. "Unless there are applications that are really compelling on Itanium, Intel is making its job harder and harder" through the continual improvements to Xeon, said Tim Shetler, vice president of marketing at TimesTen, which develops databases.
2004-09-08 - Itanium not meeting Intel's goals  SAN FRANCISCO--In a rare admission, an Intel executive said Tuesday that the company's high-end Itanium chip family still isn't living up to popularity expectations. "Are we meeting the specific goals this year? Not to the aggressive levels we've set," Abhi Talwalkar, general manager of Intel's Enterprise Platform Group, said while answering questions after a speech at the Intel Developer Forum here. Eye on multicore computing and WiMaxPaul Otellini, president, Intel Intel once positioned Itanium as the chip that would become as dominant in the server market as the Pentium is among personal computers. But Intel's Xeon processor, which runs the same software as Pentium machines, still accounts for the majority of server shipments, and Intel in recent years has positioned Itanium only as a replacement for competitors' high-end chips, such as Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc and IBM's Power. Despite the admission, Talwalkar also said Itanium is strong and meeting its long-term goals. In large-scale servers, Itanium server revenue has been doubling or tripling, compared to year-earlier periods, while increasing tenfold for top-end machines with 16 or more processors. In addition, the number of dual- and four-processor Itanium-based server models has increased from 20 in 2002 to 70 this year, while the number of systems with eight or more Itanium processors has increased from five to 20 during the same period, he said. To try to boost sales, Intel is promoting pilot programs to let potential customers test Itanium servers in the hope that they'll then commit to the technology, Talwalkar said in interview. Slow start notwithstanding, Intel remains committed to Itanium. Earlier Tuesday, Talwalkar demonstrated a four-processor server that uses the next-generation Montecito model in the Itanium family, due out in 2005. special coverage Intel Developer Forum 2004 Dual-core chips are a highlight of the three-day gathering. For all stories from the event, plus video, click here. Montecito will arrive at the "tail end" of 2005 and reach "very high volume in 2006," Talwalkar said. Montecito, he said, will improve performance over the Itanium 2 9M version by a factor of 1.5 to 2; it will sport the "Pellston" technology that shuts down faulty communication lines to cache memory; and it will use the "Foxton" technology, which speeds up the processor 10 percent to 15 percent when it's running cool enough. And in his speech, Talwalkar showed a plan for a faster Montecito code-named Montvale, due to arrive by the end of 2006. In addition, there will be a low-voltage version of Montvale. There is a place for both Xeon and Itanium, he said. "We believe the dual-architecture approach is the best approach to meet the diverse needs" of corporate buyers, he said. But he also acknowledged the difficulty caused by the decision to upgrade Xeon with 64-bit extensions, a feature that lets it address more memory and which previously was one of the main advantages Itanium had over Xeon. "I would be remiss to say the impact was zero, but the impact was mostly noise and confusion," Talwalkar said of the decision, referred to as EM64T. "It set us back a few months, I think, with the general audience." Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice offered an interpretation of Talwalkar's words: "The EM64T thing knocked them for a loop," he said. "They should have expected that, but planning cycles and announcement cycles aren't always synchronized." Intel was forced to announce EM64T earlier than it hoped, because rival Advanced Micro Devices was stealing too much thunder with its own version of the technology, AMD64, which went on sale with the Opteron processor in 2003, Eunice said. "The AMD stuff was just getting too hot and too visible. Really good customers were getting too interested," Eunice said. The next Itanium The next addition to the Itanium family will be an Itanium 2 that runs faster by boosting on-board cache memory from the current 6MB to 9MB. It will arrive by the end of the year, Talwalkar said in a meeting with reporters--a little late, according to sources who said Intel had hoped to unveil it this week. Power consumption and its corresponding waste heat are another challenge. Coming technology such as demand-based switching--which slows down processors during brief lulls--will address some current power problems, Talwalkar said, but "it's not enough." However, he added, "we've got other things that are driving a significant shift (toward) far better performance-per-watt capability in the coming future." Intel deserves credit for being candid with customers even when the news doesn't reflect well on the company, Eunice said. "If you're telling people how it is, that's a benefit. These people depend on this technology," he said. Intel President Paul Otellini defended the Itanium program in a meeting with reporters Tuesday. "This part of the market is strategically important," he said, and building chips for high-performance machines lets Intel develop new features that later can be added to lower-cost processors. New chips revealed Intel also revealed code names and schedule details for several new processors, though conspicuously absent was a name for a dual-core Xeon. Among the schedule details: For multiprocessor Xeon servers--those with four or more processors--Intel announced a new model code-named Cranford, due out in the first half 2005. It will have less high-speed cache memory than the previously announced Potomac model coming at the same time, making it better for price-conscious buyers, Talwalkar said. Succeeding Cranford and Potomac in 2005 or 2006 will be Tulsa, the first dual-core Xeon for multiprocessor servers. Those three chips will be the first multiprocessor models to support EM64T, Talwalkar said. The next-generation multiprocessor Xeon, coming in 2006 or 2007, is code-named Whitefield. It will use the "Common Platform Architecture," a technology that lets Xeon and Itanium servers share the same socket, electrical communications, memory interface, chipsets and other components. Talwalkar described several lower-end Itanium models for dual-processor servers. As Itanium progresses from the imminent Itanium 2 9MB cache product to Montecito to Montvale to Tukwila, corresponding versions of those chips are planned for dual-processor servers. Those versions are code-named Fanwood, Millington, DP Montvale and Dimona, respectively, Talwalkar said, and all those chips also will be released in low-voltage versions. A dual-processor Xeon code-named Irwindale will debut in 2005. It's a new version of the current "Nocona" version of Xeon that boosts cache memory from 1MB to 2MB, he said. By 2006, Intel will begin offering a feature code-named Silvervale Technology (ST) that will make it easier to run multiple independent operating systems on Xeon or Itanium servers. The technology uses the same interface as the Vanderpool Technology (VT) that will bring a similar feature to PCs, meaning that software companies such as Microsoft or VMware supporting the technology won't have to write different versions of their products for ST and VT, Talwalkar said. Talwalkar also demonstrated a faster memory technology called FBD--short for "fully buffered DIMM" (double inline memory module)--that will debut "in the first part 2006" in dual-processor servers, he said. FBD, which grafts onto existing DDR2 (Double Data Rate 2) memory chips, transmits data to and from memory modules using a serial interface that can operate at higher speeds than the prevailing parallel method. Serial interfaces transmit streams of data at high speeds that are collected in a memory storage area called a buffer. By comparison, parallel interfaces transmit data in lockstep across several signal paths, but synchronization issues make it harder to improve. Serial technologies such as universal serial bus and serial ATA hard drives have been replacing parallel interfaces in PCs in recent years.
2007-11-01 - Itanium goes bump in the night Perhaps it was in observance of Halloween, but whatever the reason there was something a bit ghostly about Intel's October 31 announcement of its latest Itanium processor. You had to peer hard to catch even a glimpse of the Intel Itanium Processor 9100 announcement--formerly known under the "Montvale" code name. Neither Intel nor HP (which sells something like 90 percent of the Itaniums that go out Intel's doors) held briefings on the new processor iteration, and even simple press releases dribbled out belatedly. It's the sort of treatment usually reserved for announcements of new sales offices or CEO speeches at obscure conferences. I suppose that they could have made the announcement on a Saturday if they wanted to be even more wraithlike--but this was pretty close. To be sure, this was a fairly modest bump. Montvale barely edges its "Montecito" predecessor in frequency (1.66GHz vs. 1.6GHz, or about 4 percent). More important is the 667MHz front-side bus (FSB), which gives about 25 percent faster memory access. Reliability ("core-level lock-step") and power efficiency ("demand-based switching") tweaks round out the new features. Bigger changes await the future quad-core "Tukwila," due late 2008 or so; it will also sport an integrated memory controller and new serial interconnect. One almost gets the sense that Intel and HP hoped that if they soft-pedaled this announcement, no one would notice and therefore, the usual suspects wouldn't revel in the opportunity to engage in Itanium-mocking. Well, that didn't work.
2003-02-03 - Itanium gives OpenVMS new lease on life    Hewlett-Packard engineers on Friday got the OpenVMS operating system up and running on an Itanium-based computer, a crucial step to ensuring the venerable OS doesn't suffer the fate of many of its shorter-lived contemporaries. Booting OpenVMS on an HP i2000 Itanium server is a momentous event for the operating system, which just passed its 25-year anniversary. HP is moving all its server lines to Intel's Itanium chip, meaning that OpenVMS must make the switch or be left behind with HP's Alpha processor, the last generation of which is planned for 2004. "We're celebrating here," said Mark Gorham, vice president of OpenVMS at HP, who said the success was the culmination of 19 months of work at the OpenVMS lab in Nashua, N.H. While OpenVMS isn't widely used, it's popular with important customers such as hospitals, stock exchanges and telecommunications companies, which HP can't afford to alienate. If HP canceled the product, those customers likely would "blacklist" HP on the basis that the company isn't looking after its customers' interests, said IDC analyst Dan Kusnetzky. Friday's positive results with Itanium mean the company will be able to begin shipping developer kits to key software partners such as Oracle in June and sell OpenVMS Itanium servers one year after that, Gorham said. It's not the first time OpenVMS has had to grapple with major change. The operating system, one of the jewels in the crown of once-mighty Digital Equipment Corp. and originally called VMS, was designed hand-in-hand with Digital's VAX processors and computing hardware. Digital announced VMS in October 1977, and customers began using it in April 1978. But Digital wasn't able to sustain its strength as a company, and Compaq Computer acquired the firm in 1998. Then in 2002, HP acquired Compaq. The VMS customer base is a loyal one by all accounts, but that alone doesn't secure a future for an architecture. The HP 3000 line of computers, a contemporary of the original VAX machines and one with tremendous loyalty, still didn't have enough of a fan base to keep HP from announcing in 2001 its eventual demise. And transitions are hard to make for the users of an OS. Software must be rewritten, tested and often repurchased, Kusnetzky said. "The longtime VAX VMS users had to go through a very painful process to become Alpha VMS users. Will they make that transition again? This is a gamble HP is taking," Kusnetzky said. HP is confident those customers will be happy with OpenVMS' viability. Major software companies including Oracle, Computer Associates, BMC and BEA Systems have backed the Itanium version of OpenVMS. And about 85 percent of specialist software companies have expressed support, with more to come now that HP has proof OpenVMS will work on Itanium, Gorham said. HP provides programming tools so customers will be able to create an Alpha and Itanium version of their products off the same code base, Gorham said. And HP will sell Alpha-based systems for years to come. Gorham estimates that about 400,000 servers still run OpenVMS. It's in use at about 2,000 hospitals. Given those customers, and the fact that the OpenVMS business is profitable, it wasn't hard for HP to decide to keep it alive, Gorham said. But at least one analyst questioned that assertion, saying that profitable or not, it probably wasn't an easy decision for the company to support the operating system. "OpenVMS is a legacy play," a product that sells little outside the existing customer base, said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. "It was probably one of the closer calls HP had to make to answer the question what did it bring forward versus what it didn't." Cluster champ Solid technology helped sustain OpenVMS. One of its chief advantages is strong "clustering" capability, in which two or more systems are linked together so one can take over if another fails. "Even today, it's probably better at clustering than most environments out there," Haff said. "OpenVMS' cachet is rock-solid reliability." The quality of the clustering has meant customers could switch off a system, install new hardware and fire it back up again, all without the software skipping a beat, Haff said. "We think...somewhere between 90 percent and 95 percent" of OpenVMS customers use its clustering features, Gorham said. "It has been one of the signature areas." HP will support OpenVMS clusters built of both Alpha- and Itanium-based computers, an essential step to making the migration. One challenge for OpenVMS in the future is staving off ever-improving systems that have more mainstream use: Windows, Unix and Linux. When computers ship in higher volumes, component costs decrease, software companies are more interested, developers are easier to find and support is easier to come by. "Any time you design something that's general purpose," Haff said, "it will rarely be as good as the specialist. But over time in the computing industry, general purpose usually wins. General purpose usually becomes good enough." Where Unix edged in on the VMS turf once it became good enough, Linux now is edging in on Unix. And Digital engineers are helping that happen. Clustering programmers from Digital, including Brian Stevens and Tim Burke, moved to a start-up called Mission Critical Linux and now are working at top Linux seller Red Hat. That clustering work now is part of Red Hat Advanced Server, said Stevens, now vice president of operating systems at Red Hat. VMS was designed to support clustering from the ground up, but it's harder to retrofit such deep changes to an operating system, Haff said. Digital was gradually building clustering into its own version of Unix, improvements that eventually will make their way into HP's version, called HP-UX. HP agrees that it's foolhardy to try to deny mainstream computing trends. Indeed, its OpenVMS strategy is largely a move to embrace the mainstream technology as much as possible, a move that began when VMS was renamed OpenVMS after it acquired the ability to run some Unix software. More recently, OpenVMS was fitted with the ability to run Java programs. And for the latest technology, HP is bringing a version of the open-source Apache Software Foundation Web server software to OpenVMS, Gorham said. The move to Itanium will keep OpenVMS closer to mainstream hardware, as well. The Itanium move means HP's computer development cost will result in a single line of products that can run OpenVMS, Linux, Windows and HP-UX. (Separate Itanium hardware will run HP's fifth operating system, the ultra-high-end NonStop Kernel.) By mid-2004, HP plans to sell OpenVMS servers with two, four, eight and possibly 16 processors, Gorham said. It plans 32-processor and 64-processor versions by late 2004, and, if all goes well, 128-processor Superdome support in 2005. With the unified hardware foundation, HP believes it will be able to keep its OpenVMS competitive. "The strategy for HP is to take advantage as much as possible of the standardized world," Gorham said.
2003-04-10 - Itanium gets supercomputing software   Researchers at the National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure have built full Itanium support into software that can be used to assemble supercomputers out of clusters of Linux computers. Version 2.3.2 of the NPACI Rocks software, code-named Annapurna, is the first version to support Itanium, Intel's high-end processor, NPACI said in a statement Thursday. The software makes it easier to install the Linux operating system on numerous computers despite differences between each machine. There already was an Itanium version of the Rocks software, but it didn't include all the software components of the version for computers using Intel's Pentium and Xeon or Advanced Micro Devices' Athlon chips. The move will make it easier for Rocks users to add Itanium systems into clusters that use the other chips, according to Philip Papadopoulos, program director for the San Diego Supercomputing Center's (SDSC) grid and cluster computing group. Because Itanium understands a completely different set of instructions from lower-end Intel processors, software must be rebuilt for the newer chips. That barrier has hindered adoption of Itanium in broad business markets, but it's been less of a problem in the supercomputing niche, where customers often control their own software instead of relying on products such as Oracle's database or Computer Associates' management software. Indeed, Gartner analyst John Enck said in a March 26 report that Itanium systems are fine for supercomputing clusters and will expand this year to some mainstream markets. "Gartner believes (the Itanium processor family) is safe for high-performance computer clusters immediately and will be ready for mainstream database use on all operating systems by year-end 2003," Enck said. "Other application usage models will quickly follow." The NPACI Rocks software is being used at a host of academic and government sites, including Northwestern University, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Stanford University and the University of Macedonia. Rocks is an open-source program that's developed by the NPACI at the SDSC by the University of California at Berkeley, Singapore Computing systems and individual programmers. It's based on Red Hat Linux version 7.3. The program includes cluster software for tasks such as sending messages from one computer to another, monitoring each system's performance and scheduling jobs across the cluster.
2002-10-09 - Itanium gets Linux supercomputer boost Quadrics, which manufactures gear that links numerous Linux computers into a single supercomputer, has made its products compatible with systems built around Intel's Itanium 2 chip. The Bristol, England-based company now offers its network cards and software for Itanium 2 systems as well as for setups based on Intel's Xeon processor, the company said Wednesday. The added support for Xeon-based systems is a less dramatic shift since Xeons use the same software as the Pentium III chips Quadrics already supported. Quadrics and competitor Myricom make the equipment used to set up high-speed, fast-response connections for this newer breed of supercomputers. Previously, Quadrics' focus has largely been on Hewlett-Packard's Tru64 Unix servers using the Alpha processor, but customers are now seeking the better number-crunching abilities of Itanium and Xeon chips. The move is small victory in Intel's long-running campaign to build a complete set of computing technology around the high-end Itanium family, a dramatic departure from its mainstream Pentium, Xeon and Celeron processors. The Itanium family has been slow to catch on, in part because it requires that software be overhauled. Supercomputer customers are increasingly drawn to "cluster" supercomputers--those made up of separate, networked systems. Such setups are often less expensive than earlier designs but require more expertise to assemble and run. A cottage industry has sprung up to fill the gap, including Linux NetworX, Scyld Computing, Atipa, Quadrics and Myricom. At the same time, Hewlett-Packard, Dell Computer and IBM are trying to snatch a piece of the pie for themselves. Customers include pharmaceuticals companies poring through genetic information for new drugs, seismic research companies looking for oil and gas, universities trying to fund a variety of research projects and national laboratories simulating nuclear explosions. The Itanium family is a good match for supercomputers. The chips are well-suited to churn through mathematical calculations. And though there's not as much software for the processors, supercomputer customers often write their own programs and don't need the many software packages mainstream businesses rely on. Linux is far and away the most widely used operating system for the new breed of clustered supercomputers, though there are some instances of Windows clusters, such as one at the one at the Cornell Theory Center. In Quadrics' case, the company's software requires deep access to the operating system's heart, or kernel, something that's easy with the open-source General Public License (GPL) that governs Linux. "Currently we are not seeing a concerted effort to port to Windows," a company representative said. Quadrics' network cards plug into computers' PCI slots, but a second-generation product coming in the first half of 2003 will use the faster PCI-X data pathway. Rival Myricom already supports Itanium systems, running either Windows or Linux. "Myricom is our biggest competitor with a major share of the market," the Quadrics representative acknowledged, but Quadrics is trying to compete by offering management software for administering how jobs run on the cluster.
2001-11-14 - Itanium flunking Compaq server tests   Intel's Itanium processor is failing to pass Compaq Computer's stress tests, according to a Compaq representative, thus holding up the release of Compaq's Itanium servers. A Compaq representative said that the company has experienced "sightings" with Itanium, Intel's 64-bit processor for servers, in Compaq's internal testing of its ProLiant DL590/64. The representative would not go so far as to call the issue a flaw, but said the problem appeared to be caused by the processor. The problem crops up with servers running both the 733MHz and 800MHz version of the chip. Sightings are a broad computer industry term for equipment that fails to perform as expected in testing, but with no immediately apparent defects. Compaq has tested servers from other small manufacturers and found they too did not pass Compaq's rigorous tests--a normal prerequisite for commercial release. "In our opinion, it is an Intel Itanium issue," the representative said. Compaq and Intel are working to determine the root cause of the problem. An Intel representative confirmed the sightings but added that most such problems are not chip-related. Most sightings also do not rise to the level of a flaw. He also noted that Itanium servers from other manufacturers continue to ship. The problem is the latest stumble for Itanium, one of the most ambitious product launches in Intel's history. The chip, co-developed by Intel and Hewlett-Packard, is designed to power servers that will compete against machines from Sun Microsystems. Itanium, however, contains an entirely new architecture and instruction set that took years to complete and debug. Few chip companies have been able to successfully switch from one chip design to another easily. Most, including Intel, typically enhance the existing core product. Originally due in the mid- to late 90s, the chip only came out commercially in May 2001. Partly because of the delays and partly because of performance, most server manufacturers have barely marketed servers containing the first version of the chip and are concentrating on the next version, code-named McKinley, which comes out next year. Some computer executives have become increasingly critical of the chip. Because the chip is based on an entirely new design, very little software exists today that runs on the server--a situation exacerbated by the harsh economic climate. Customer interest for Itanium servers is "effectively zero," Joe Marengi, senior vice president and general manager, Dell Americas, said in an interview Tuesday at the Comdex Fall 2001 trade show. "The investment involved in the transition in huge. "I don't see the speed and benefit to what the processor brings to the equation," he added. Intel is also facing a potential competitive threat from AMD's Hammer processor for servers, coming out late next year. Hammer is effectively based on Intel's familiar X86 architecture but can also run 64-bit applications. While no major U.S. manufacturer has ever used an AMD processor in a server, some analysts have said that the potential performance, as well as comparative familiarity of the architecture, could make Hammer interesting to them.
2005-08-30 - Itanium allies to pool development efforts Many companies backing Intel's Itanium processor are planning to announce a new alliance in September to try to make it easier for customers to adopt systems using the high-end chip, CNET News.com has learned. The group, called the Itanium Solutions Alliance, has several plans to make Itanium more useful, said a source involved with the outfit. The alliance will sponsor porting events to help programmers bring their software to the processor, set up porting centers where such work can take place and create catalogs so customers in specific industries can find combinations of Itanium hardware and software for various tasks. In addition to Intel and Hewlett-Packard--the co-developer of Itanium and the top seller of Itanium servers--the alliance includes server makers NEC, SGI, Unisys, Hitachi, Fujitsu and Bull, and software makers Microsoft, Red Hat, Novell, Oracle, SAP and SAS, the source said. News.context What's new: A new alliance of server makers has been formed to ease customer adoption of Intel's Itanium processor. Bottom line: The move is the latest step in a years-long effort to get the processor to catch on. More stories on Itanium The alliance is a new step in a years-long effort to encourage broad Itanium use and is an indication of just how much effort its backers are willing to put into getting the processor to catch on. But some believe the effort is late. "It sure would have been nice to have this several years ago," Sageza Group analyst Clay Ryder said. "What happened here is Intel seriously underestimated the support the marketplace would have for an incompatible platform and believed 'if we (Intel) say it's industry standard, everybody will come.' Clearly that didn't happen." Intel and HP declined to comment for this report. However, Intel spokeswoman Erica Fields said the chipmaker has been working hard to attract hardware and software partners and now there are more than 5,000 software applications and five operating systems available for Itanium. There are plenty of companies selling and buying Itanium-related products, but not nearly the number Intel and HP projected when the chip was under development in the 1990s. Itanium's rocky past The chip's debut this decade was marred by delays, low initial performance and incompatibility with software for x86 processors such as Pentium and Xeon, which are vastly more widely used. In 2004, Intel missed Itanium shipment goals and HP scrapped its Itanium workstation. In 2005, IBM backed off plans to sell its own Itanium servers. In response to the troubles, Intel redefined Itanium as a chip chiefly intended for high-end multiprocessor servers, models that today usually use RISC (reduced instruction set computing) processors such as IBM's Power, Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc, Fujitsu's Sparc64 and HP's PA-RISC. In line with that high-end positioning, Microsoft's planned update to its Windows Server 2003 operating system--called R2--won't be available for Itanium. Microsoft's rationale for the move is that R2 is geared toward smaller servers. The Window Server 2003 successor due in 2007, code-named Longhorn Server, will support Itanium, however. Itanium hasn't yet reached heir-apparent status by most estimates. HP--the server maker that has pushed the chip most aggressively--sold $287 million in Itanium-based Unix servers in the second quarter of 2005, compared with $778 million in the PA-RISC-based Unix servers they're intended to replace, according to Gartner figures. But Intel has convinced Unisys, NEC, SGI, Fujitsu and Hitachi to join HP in designing mammoth Itanium systems and bringing them to the market. "The industry has lined up--all but one--with Itanium as the platform of choice for RISC replacement and mainframe platforms for the future," Pat Gelsinger, general manager of Intel's digital enterprise group, said last week at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. The lone holdout Gelsinger referred to is IBM, whose Power processor is the second horse in what Intel likes to call a two-horse race, but it should be noted that Sun also shuns Itanium in favor of high-end systems built around Sparc processors. Intel's Itanium plans still extend years into the future. Next up will be a model code-named Montecito, due to be released by the end of this year. It employs dual processing engines called cores, an approach already used by high-end server chips from Sun, HP and IBM. "Montecito will deliver a huge step up in performance, more than doubling the performance capabilities of today's Madison family of products," Gelsinger said last week. After Montecito comes a close relative called Montvale, in 2006. Then in 2007, Intel plans to introduce a four-core Itanium called Tukwila, a design that will be succeeded by another four-core chip, code-named Poulson. For years, one of Itanium's advantages over Xeon was a 64-bit architecture that permitted easy use of vast amounts of memory. Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron brought that feature to x86 processors in 2003, though, and Intel followed suit with 64-bit Xeons in 2004. The Xeons have the advantage because they run the vast amount of software already available for x86 processors such as Pentium. But efforts to expand the pool of available software should help Itanium's prospects, Ryder said. "Most people do not buy systems because of floating-point performance, (and) the war for basic processing capability is largely over. There's more than enough for most people," Ryder said. "They buy systems based on applications." Correction: This story included incorrect figures for Hewlett-Packard's Itanium server revenue in the second quarter of 2005. The company sold $287 million in Itanium-based Unix servers, compared with $778 million in PA-RISC-based Unix servers.
2006-03-11 - Itanium allies fund open-source compiler work  In the newest of a series of moves to try to impart momentum to Intel's Itanium processor, allies backing the chip are funding work to improve a key programming tool. Some of the $10 billion in five years that members of the Itanium Solutions Alliance are spending on Itanium market and technology development will go to Itanium-specific improvements to the GCC, or GNU Compiler Collection. The Gelato Federation, an organization dedicated to boosting Linux on Itanium computers, is overseeing the work, the allies said this week at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. Compilers translate human-written software into instructions a computer understands, and compilers are key to Itanium. One core principle behind the Itanium chip, codeveloped by Hewlett-Packard and Intel, is that compilers can sort instructions in advance so the chip can process several with each tick of its clock. Specifically, the work is geared to improve compiler details: superblock scheduling, instruction scheduling and speculation, and memory disambiguation. The ultimate goal is "to deliver a GCC compiler optimized to support Itanium solutions," the alliance and Gelato Federation said in a statement.
2005-12-07 - Itanium A cautionary tale  On June 8, 1994, Hewlett-Packard and Intel announced a bold collaboration to build a next-generation processor called Itanium, intended to remake the computing industry.Eleven years and billions of dollars later, Itanium serves instead as a cautionary tale of how complex, long-term development plans can go drastically wrong in a fast-moving industry. Despite years of marketing and product partnerships, Itanium remains a relative rarity among servers. In the third quarter of this year, 7,845 Itanium servers were sold, according to research by Gartner. That compares with 62,776 machines with Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc, 31,648 with IBM's Power, and 9,147 with HP's PA-RISC. But perhaps most significant, it compares with 1.7 million servers with x86 chips, based on an architecture Itanium was intended to replace."At the original launch, the claims from HP and Intel were essentially saying, 'If you're not with us, you're going to die. We're going to be the chip that runs everything,'" said Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice. "It so happens that promise has largely been achieved, but with x86." The saga illustrates the risks of such sweeping strategies. While grand plans offer the promise of major rewards, long development cycles mean many more chances to stumble or be overtaken by unanticipated events--such as x86's longevity. Itanium isn't a unique example; Microsoft's ambitious "Longhorn" version of Windows has been delayed and pared back several times, meaning that some technology the company hoped to release in the 1990s won't show up until 2006 or later. Itanium did vanquish two rival chip families: Compaq's Alpha and Silicon Graphics' MIPS. It also has respectable performance and is gradually replacing the PA-RISC family from HP, which sold 79 percent of all Itanium servers in the third quarter of 2005, according to Gartner figures. But the processor's long history has more notably been marked by a series of missteps that undermined its heir-apparent status. The latest problem cropped up in late October, when Intel announced that the release of the first dual-core Itanium, code-named Montecito, would be delayed from 2005 until mid-2006. Earlier problems included other delays, poor initial performance and software incompatibility with the processors it was designed to replace. Moreover, throughout Itanium's inglorious debut, Intel was dramatically improving x86 chips, and IBM, Sun and Advanced Micro Devices poured more resources into their rival chips. The future looks unlikely to get better, said Kevin Krewell, editor-in-chief of industry newsletter Microprocessor Report. "It's not promising. It has a space that will be there for a number of years, but it's been marginalized," Krewell said. "It's not hard to see that Itanium is not going to go much beyond the niche of replacing Alpha and PA-RISC." Billions investedIntel and HP are mum about how much money has been invested in the project. But some data points are clear. Albert Yu, general manager of Intel's microprocessor products group, was quoted in Electronic Engineering Times in 1994 as saying the joint development effort for Itanium would entail an investment of $400 million to $500 million over several years. But the project grew well beyond that price tag as it slipped and backers had to pump funding into a massive effort to get third parties to revamp software for the new chip family. Several analysts estimate the cost as multiple billions of dollars, and the spending hasn't stopped: In December 2004, HP pledged to spend a further $3 billion to fund Itanium-related software, hardware and marketing work. "The fact that they spent so much money to develop Itanium implies to me they expected an equally huge return on that investment," said Linley Group analyst Linley Gwennap, who followed Itanium closely for years for Microprocessor Report. Intel and HP acknowledge they've had challenges with Itanium but staunchly defend the effort. "I think it's doing very well," said Lisa Graff, general manager of Intel's high-end server group. She points to gains in Itanium's scaled-back mission of replacing Power, UltraSparc and other reduced instruction set computing (RISC) chips and observes that half of the world's 100 biggest companies use Itanium systems. "I think Itanium is still the architecture for the next 20 years," Graff said. "It's the newest architecture that has come out. It has the headroom. I think the RISC architectures will run out of steam." Rich Marcello, general manager of HP's Business Critical Server group, adds that more than 90 percent of the company's customers moving off PA-RISC systems are moving to Itanium. Dividing the market between two chip families is a solid strategy, he added. "The reality is you take $45 billion server market and break it in two," HP's x86-based ProLiant servers for the bottom $22.5 billion and Itanium-based Integrity servers for the other half, he said. But that divide is somewhat artificial. AMD has made a series of server-oriented improvements to its x86 Opteron chip, making it a better competitor both to Itanium and to Xeon, Intel's x86 server chip. AMD beat Intel to market with useful x86 server features such dual-processing cores, lower power consumption and a 64-bit design--the latter once one of the main advantages Itanium held over 32-bit x86 chips. In a few short years, AMD's features drew IBM, Sun and even HP to offer Opteron servers, and the chip continues to make strides. In third-quarter shipments of x86 servers, AMD accounted for 5 percent in 2004 but 10 percent in 2005, according to Gartner, while revenue jumped from 4 percent to 8 percent. In addition, some potential customers are put off by Intel's approach. The reason high-end x86 server start-up Fabric7 chose Opteron is that it easily works in systems with eight processor sockets, CEO Sharad Mehrotra said. "Intel doesn't want you to build greater than four-socket topologies of Xeon," he said. Intel's moves to keep Xeon competitive hurt Itanium. "Once AMD showed Intel what to do with x86--adding 64-bit support--that was the end of Itanium right there. When Intel announced it was going to do (64-bit x86 chips), it was obvious Itanium was irrelevant for anything but the high end of the market," said Peter Glaskowsky, an Envisioneering analyst and chief architect of start-up MemoryLogix. Back in the dayThe Itanium project began in December 1988 as a secret HP research project to create a successor to the company's own PA-RISC processor family, according to HP Labs' then-chief Dick Lampman. In 1993, HP approached Intel with the idea of collaborating, said Jerry Huck, HP's technical leader on the project. "Producing our own chips--there was not enough volume, and the economics were not in our favor," he said of the company's decision not to build its own processors. "Intel floated to the top of the list pretty quickly as somebody with the resources that would make this work." "Once AMD showed Intel what to do with x86--adding 64-bit support--that was the end of Itanium right there." When HP and Intel announced their partnership in 1994, Richard Sevcik, general manager in HP's server group, said in a press release that the companies would create "a unified computing infrastructure that accomplishes three fundamental goals: preserves current customer investments, readies corporate customers for the next century and offers high-volume cost models." So far, none of those goals has been met. The chip, initially code-named PA-WideWord, used an architecture called Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing, or EPIC. HP hoped the design would execute more instructions in parallel by lining them up in advance for maximum speed. Those instructions are ordered by an advanced compiler--the software that translates human-written programs into the code consumed by the actual processors. EPIC's compiler-oriented technique contrasts with RISC chips, which are geared to adapt to whatever software instructions are thrown at them. In 1997, Intel and HP revealed more details, saying the Itanium design "is expected to advance the state of the art in processor technologies, specifically addressing the performance limitations found in today's RISC and CISC (complex instruction set computing) technologies." (x86 chips are CISC designs, though their external interfaces now cloak faster RISC-like cores.) Itanium also would provide "full compatibility for IA-32 (x86) applications and operating systems," Intel said in its press release. The initial Itanium prospects were impressive. All the major server and operating systems companies jumped on board. "Originally, Itanium was envisioned as an architecture to replace the entire spectrum, and that turned out to be overly ambitious." Sun created a version of Solaris for Itanium in the 1990s. IBM joined with the Santa Cruz Operation and Sequent to combine their Unix products into an Itanium operating system code-named Monterey. Microsoft offered Windows 2000 for Itanium. Linux allies banded with Intel and server makers in a project called Trillian to adapt the open-source operating system to the chip. Compaq's Tru64 Unix was up and running on an Itanium software. And Silicon Graphics decided to support Itanium and Linux in preference to its own MIPS processor and Irix operating system. "The momentum was huge," Gwennap said. "There was this incredible anticipation and expectation that this was going to be the next big thing. Intel was on a roll, and with HP backing them, then other companies started jumping on the bandwagon." Itanium derailedThen big problems hit. The first Itanium, code-named Merced, was delayed from 1999 to mid-2000. When it arrived even later, in May 2001, even lowly x86 chips beat it in important performance tests. When Intel and HP launched the Itanium project, "they thought they had just laid the golden egg," Eunice said. However, "when Merced arrived, it was a turd." Even HP called Merced a mere "development environment."The delays forced SGI to extend its MIPS chip family by two generations and cancel its first-generation Itanium system. "We had a product we designed based on the Merced chip which we elected not to take into the market," said Dave Parry, general manager for SGI's server group. And Sun--admittedly a lukewarm ally that never planned to sell its own Itanium servers--dropped Solaris support in 2000. Intel got the Itanium train back on the tracks after Merced, doubling performance with "McKinley" in 2002. In 2003, it launched "Madison" with 6MB of on-board cache memory; the next year, it unveiled "Madison 9M" with 9MB of cache and a plan for the 2005 release of the dual-core "Montecito.""Montecito is a fundamentally new, true dual-core design. It does get significant performance advantages over the previous single-core parts," Glaskowsky said. Behind the scenes, there had been another Itanium shift. An ambitious future-generation product code-named Tanglewood had been planned with as many as 16 processing cores, according to a source familiar with the plan and a document about the chip seen by CNET News.com. But in December 2003, Intel announced the model would be called Tukwila instead--quietly moving to a more conventional design that had four or more cores, slated for release in 2007. Retreat to the high endAs Intel grappled to produce desirable Itanium products, it gradually reduced its ambitions until the chip's niche was just high-end systems. Itanium is tailored for "the biggest iron," Pat Gelsinger, senior vice president of the Digital Enterprise Group in charge of the servers, said in a March interview. "I was the one who initiated that, probably two-and-a-half years ago," Marcello said of the high-end shift. "I don't think you can span the entire sever market with one architecture. Originally, Itanium was envisioned as an architecture to replace the entire spectrum, and that turned out to be overly ambitious." The new direction diminished Itanium's potential influence. "Each time, it was whittled to a smaller and smaller niche, trying to make it more successful," Krewell said. In 2004, Intel acknowledged that Itanium shipments weren't meeting the company's goals--it had hoped to double its chip sales total in 2004, from 100,000 in 2003. But the problems went beyond hardware. The initial promise that x86 and PA-RISC software would run unchanged on the chip only came true for a tiny fraction of applications, and Intel and HP began working hard to lure software companies, whose revenues are tied strongly to how widely a server family is used. HP and Intel have made progress on the software front. They now have a list of 5,000 applications that run on Itanium, about half of them for HP-UX. In addition, they launched the Itanium Solutions Alliance this year to help lure more. "We've had some Itanium prospects who had to go back to PA-RISC because their (software) tools weren't available on Itanium." Unfortunately, 5,000 applications still isn't enough. Chris Koppe, CEO of Quebec-based Speedware and a board member of the Encompass HP user group, has seen firsthand the importance of the missing Itanium software as his company helps customers migrate off the HP 3000, an earlier server line that's being phased out. About 70 percent of those customers are moving to HP-UX, and of those about half are still buying PA-RISC servers and half Itanium, Koppe said. "We've had some Itanium prospects who had to go back to PA-RISC because their (software) tools weren't available on Itanium," Koppe said, adding that the tide is slowly turning. Newer troublesThe October news of Montecito's delay isn't the Itanium's only recent trouble. Intel has also lowered the chip's planned top speed and disabled a 200MHz performance-boosting feature called Foxton. Release dates for future sequels also slipped a year--a Montecito revamp code-named Montvale into 2007, and Tukwila into 2008. On top of that, some Itanium allies have departed or backed away. IBM and Dell dropped Itanium servers this year, leaving HP the only one of the top server makers to sell them. Among the smaller remaining companies that sell Itanium systems--NEC, Unisys, Fujitsu, Silicon Graphics Inc., Groupe Bull and Hitachi--there has been consolidation, as NEC and Unisys announced an October partnership to jointly design Itanium systems. In January, Microsoft canceled Windows for Itanium workstations and in September said the next Itanium version of Windows for servers would be limited to use with high-end software such as the SQL Server database. SGI, already struggling financially, has been hit again. "We were aligning our road map and product delivery to have a time-to-market release with the Montecito processor," Parry said. "Fortunately, we got enough advance insight into where things were that we've been able to react and build a product line based on Madison 9M as an interim solution." SGI still believes it made the right decision, though. "Intel is going onward and upward with additional dual-core and multicore designs. We see them as great engines to our systems," Parry said. The Montecito delay in October also affected HP, which had planned to release a new high-end Itanium server that uses Montecito and a chipset code-named Arches. The October change particularly affected Unisys, whose ES7000 line can accommodate both Xeon and Itanium chips. The company now is delaying a feature that Intel had planned to launch in 2007, a "common platform architecture" that would allow Xeon and Itanium chips to plug into the same sockets. That would have simplified Unisys server designs. Competitors have become increasingly eager to pounce on Itanium. Software companies "make their money on licensee counts, so for them it's very important for them to achieve volume," said Karl Freund, vice president of marketing for IBM's rival Power-based Unix servers. "It doesn't have that critical mass." And Sun President Jonathan Schwartz said on his blog in November that Itanium is headed for "a lingering death." But through it all, Itanium allies maintain their optimism. "We certainly had our challenges," HP's Huck said. "All in all, we're coming out ahead."
2003-03-26 - Itanium 2 test center opens in China   To promote the Itanium 2 server processor in Asia-Pacific, Hewlett-Packard and Intel have opened a test center in Shanghai that will allow customers to try before buying. The HP Intel Solutions Center is the first in the Asia-Pacific region and the third worldwide. There are also centers in Cupertino, Calif., and Grenoble, France. "The solutions center spearheads Itanium advancement in Asia-Pacific," said Michael Muller, a general manager and vice president with HP Asia-Pacific. The center focuses on Itanium development and, among other things, offers proof-of-concept testing, solution architecture and project support, vendor solution evaluation, certification and skill transfer. It will also provide benchmarking, a crucial function for a relatively new chip yet to gain widespread acceptance. The center allows customers to test the processor on operating systems such as HPUX (HP's Unix variant), Microsoft Windows and open-source Linux. Despite its long and often controversial history, the Itanium family appears to be gaining momentum in the market. The first version, formerly code-named Merced, was delayed several times and offered only middling performance. It finally debuted in 2001, but sales were dismal. Itanium 2, formerly "McKinley," came out in July 2002 and was substantially different from the first Itanium. Analysts have given it fairly positive reviews and sales appear to be growing. Unisys, NEC, SGI, Fujitsu and IBM all plan high-end Itanium servers, but the first four of those don't occupy the top ranks among server makers, and IBM's grander plans are built around its Power5 processor and its sequels. News.com's Michael Kanellos and Stephen Shankland contributed to this report.
2002-07-08 - Itanium 2 on the way but will it sell  The Itanium 2 processor marks a significant step in Intel's strategy to penetrate the upper echelons of the computing market. But analysts and others are asking whether it will thrive in the current economic ice age. The chip, once code-named McKinley, will be touted in benchmark studies, product releases and analyst reports all this week as part of its debut. Executives at Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel say a major redesign of the chip and improvements to the accompanying software and hardware will provide far better performance than the original Itanium, which was a major disappointment for the company. "It takes a second try to hit the performance goals you want," said Lisa Hambrick, director of enterprise processor marketing at Intel. And servers containing the chip will cost less and outperform similar RISC/Unix servers from Sun Microsystems or IBM, allowing Intel to participate in a lucrative market where chips can sell for $4,000 each and servers for more than $1 million. Analysts generally agree the new chip will shine on benchmarks and be popular in areas such as biosciences that require heavyweight numbers crunching. "the="" performance="" is="" fairly="" strong="" on="" itanium="" 2,"="" said="" sarang="" ghatpande,="" a="" research="" analyst="" at="" consulting="" firm="" d.h.="" brown="" associates.="" "it="" going="" to="" be="" tough="" competitor="" ibm's="" power="" 4,"="" the="" chip="" inside="" touted="" regatta="" server.="" =""> Unfortunately for Intel, the chip is arriving at a time when the entire industry is in a deep freeze. Corporate customers have drastically curtailed IT budgets and are less inclined to adopt or even test new technologies, a process that can consume thousands of dollars and hundreds of engineering hours. Tim Shetler, vice president of TimesTen, which makes real-time databases for telecommunications companies and large financial firms, said his customers haven't shown enough curiosity about the chip to justify a major shift in how his company designs its products. "There is not a lot of demand right now beyond a handful of interested inquiries," he said. "Certainly not enough to disturb the normal pattern of serving 150 paying customers." The company has received venture capital from Intel's IA-64 fund, which invests in businesses to encourage them to develop Itanium applications. And TimesTen will come out with a Linux/Itanium version of its application later this year. But for the most part the company will concentrate on its products for the familiar, and comparatively inexpensive, servers based on Intel's 32-bit Xeon chips, where it's seeing most of its demand. Roland Baker, president of NetExpress, which sells servers and workstations to universities and chip designers, sees a similar situation: Customers want Linux boxes with Xeon or AMD Athlon chips and show little interest in Itaniums of any stripe. The lack of urgency from corporate customers is reflected in the varying product plans of Intel's major partners. HP, IBM, Fujitsu and others will release new Itanium 2 machines during the next few weeks. On the other hand, Dell is still debating whether to release Itanium 2 machines, while Microsoft has yet to release a final version of its Windows server operating system for the Itanium family. Microsoft on Monday said that Windows Advanced Server Limited Edition 1.2 would ship to PC manufacturers later this month. The new version incorporates 64-bit code development from Windows .Net Server, which is tentatively scheduled for release late next year. The company also plans to offer Itanium 2 support for Windows .Net Enterprise Server and Windows .Net Datacenter Server. Microsoft also said Monday that it will ship the 64-bit version of Windows XP in the first quarter of 2003. The company anticipates the new version of XP will appeal to businesses doing complex scientific research, software development or 3-D animations on Itanium 2 workstations. "These guys (corporate IT managers) are glaciers when it comes to moving their equipment around," said Kevin Krewell, an analyst at Microprocessor Report, a semiconductor industry newsletter. "People aren't going to buy a bunch of these servers until the software is there. Who is going to commit their business to early release software?" Instead, volume sales won't begin until next year with the release of McKinley's successor, a chip code-named Madison, Krewell said. That time frame should sound vaguely familiar, Krewell said. When the first Itanium chip came out, Intel and others said it was a test chip. Volume shipments, according to conventional wisdom, would begin with Itanium 2. The Itanium saga The Itanium saga has gone on for more than a decade. In December 1988, Hewlett-Packard began work on a new chip architecture called EPIC, said Dick Lampman, leader of the effort and now director of HP's Labs. The project was cloaked in secrecy, with a "black budget" that made funding difficult to trace. Itanium 2: Vital statistics A quick glance at Intel's new server chip Code name: McKinley Originally expected: Second half of 2001 Number of transistors: 221 million Size: 421 square millimeters Speeds: 900MHz, 1GHz Cache size: 3MB or 1.5MB level three cache Successors: Madison and Deerfield (due 2003), Montecito (2004), Chivano* (2006) Source: Intel*Source: various Around the same time, Intel was planning its future. The company was making chips that crunched data in 32-bit chunks, but saw that it would need 64-bit chips. In addition to processing twice as much data at a time, 64-bit chips also let a single processor access data from larger amounts of memory--an important consideration for running databases and other large applications. The 32-bit chips, such as the Pentium II, III and 4 and all the existing Xeons from Intel, can juggle only 4GB of memory. Additionally, 64-bit chips can handle tremendous amounts of memory. Some Intel design teams advocated getting to 64-bit chips by merely stretching the existing 32-bit architecture, sources said, a relatively easy leap in terms of engineering. And as an added bonus, both chip families would be able to handle the same software. Intel performed this sort of stretching magic when going from 16-bit to 32-bit chips in the early 1980s (and likewise when it moved from 4-bit to 8-bit to 16-bit chips in the 1970s.) But for the 64-bit chips, the company decided to work with HP on building processors around the EPIC idea. A new software base would have to be created for EPIC chips, but the switch would also let Intel break free of many of the inherited twists in the "IA" architecture, the design behind all the other the Intel processors. By the mid-1990s, the future EPIC chips, known by the code name Merced, loomed as a danger to Sun Microsystems, Digital Equipment, IBM and other server makers that also made their own chips. With its mass manufacturing capabilities, Intel would be able to pump out low-cost, high-speed 64-bit chips faster than these individual manufacturers, analysts said at the time. Making Merced, however, proved difficult in practice and, after several lengthy delays, the chip went from being a giant killer to a conceptually interesting test vehicle. The chip finally came out commercially in May 2001. Performance was relatively anemic, and sales were even worse. In the third quarter of 2001, less than 500 Itanium servers were shipped, according to IDC. So what's new? But although the first Itanium was a flop, newer versions could succeed. For one thing, Intel still wields a larger manufacturing base than any other chipmaker, giving the company an inherent advantage when it comes to lowering costs, accelerating speeds or developing multiple products simultaneously. "In the long run--even in the short run--our capabilities in manufacturing will keep us ahead," said enterprise-chip marketing chief Hambrick. A four-processor Itanium 2 server with 8GB of memory will cost around $41,000, less than competing Sun servers. In contrast, a Sun Fire 3800 with four 900MHz UltraSparc III chips with 4GB of memory goes for $133,000, according to Sun's Web site. Hambrick says that on benchmarks the Itanium 2 system will outperform this machine. Lower prices, combined with improved performance, will certainly make Itanium 2 more attractive than its predecessor, said TimesTen's Shetler. "It looks more promising," Shetler said. "With the recession, it becomes even more of a viable option." Sun disagrees, saying Itanium will be the more expensive option. "The migration costs are going to be very big, there is very little software available and it's an unproven architecture," said Martin Chorich, a Sun spokesman. "This is the second time out with a demonstration vehicle." Another factor is that Intel has put tremendous amounts of energy and money into building a world around Itanium. The IA-64 fund invested approximately $250 million in start-ups to get them to develop Itanium applications and worked extensively with established hardware and software manufacturers to get them to make Itanium-based projects. Consulting and testing labs were set up around the world so large corporate buyers could tune their applications for the new chip. Intel will even build complete servers for manufacturers who can't spare the engineers. This option is expected to be popular with manufacturers in developing nations, such as Russia's Kraftway, said Phil Brace, a marketing manager for Intel. The company has also straightened out many of the kinks that held back the original Itanium. The photos of the core of the original Itanium looked like a "collage" of chip components rather than a tightly integrated processor, Krewell said. "They slapped the first one together to get it out the door after it slipped so badly," Krewell said. Itanium 2 is vastly improved. It contains a 400MHz bus that's 128 bits wide, compared with the 64-bit wide bus on the original Itanium, a change that allows for greater data transfer rates. The level three cache, a reservoir of memory for rapid data access, goes up to 3MB. The "pipeline," which serves as a kind of assembly line inside the processor, is also shorter. In addition, improvements have been made to the compiler, software that organizes and schedules how different resources on the chip will get deployed, Krewell said. "In the technical computing space, they need the extra performance," said D.H. Brown's Ghatpande, predicting that scientific institutions and life sciences companies will adopt the chip relatively early. Security will also improve. Like other chips, Itanium 2 can wrap data within varying levels of security. Itanium 2, though, can hold more data at the highest security levels because of data management techniques developed at the University of Washington, HP and Intel, according to John Crawford, Itanium's chief architect. Despite the improvements though, the fact remains that performance and security considerations are secondary for many corporations, said Dan Kuznetsky, an analyst at IDC. And even cost isn't necessarily the deciding factor. Companies also take a serious look at the headaches involved in incorporating new breeds of hardware and software into their organizations. Even if Itanium 2 servers cost less, businesses aren't inclined to begin the arduous process of installing them for real-world use. "Experimentation with new hardware, I suspect, is a luxury that few companies can afford," Kuznetsky said. "If they do anything at all, they will buy a small number of systems to test." And besides, existing hardware is sufficient to solve most people's problems. "The current RISC systems...provide the power we need," said Nate Robertson, of Clark County, Washington's government technology purchasing office, which opts for HP Unix servers.

2003-01-31 - Intergraph sues Texas Instruments  Intergraph has filed a lawsuit against Texas Instruments, the latest in a string of suits revolving around the patents behind Intergraph's defunct Clipper microprocessor. Huntsville, Ala.-based Intergraph alleges that some of TI's digital signal processors, TI's flagship product, infringe three patents that describe how a chip can process instructions in parallel. The patents were used to develop Intergraph's Clipper chip, a processor that was touted for its technical capabilities but failed to achieve market success. Intergraph developed its technology in the early '90s, and the DSPs in question came out in 1997, Intergraph said. Once a workstation manufacturer, Intergraph has become a services and software specialist that also derives a substantial portion of its profits from litigation and intellectual-property licensing. In 2002, the company reported revenue of $501 million. Income from operations came to $10.4 million. Net income including legal settlements came to $377.1 million. To better manage its legal affairs, the company set up an intellectual-property division, a move followed by Unix developer SCO Group. Last year, Intergraph settled two suits with Intel, which resulted in a combined payment of $450 million. In one suit, Intergraph claimed that Intel's Pentium family infringed its patents, and in the other, it alleged that the Itanium chip infringed other patents owned by Intergraph. Intel may still pay Intergraph another $100 million, depending on the outcome of a pending appeal in the Itanium case. In December, Intergraph filed a suit against Dell, Gateway and Hewlett-Packard alleging that the three PC makers violated its patents because the companies sold computers containing Pentium processors. Similar suits may be pursued against other PC makers, the company has indicated. On Thursday, Intergraph also signed a cross-licensing patent agreement with IBM. Under the agreement, IBM will pay Intergraph $10 million and transfer various patents to Intergraph. Over the years, IBM and Intergraph had entered into various cross-licensing pacts that preceded the recent suits, a representative said. The TI suit is based on the patents involved in the Itanium suit. While TI's chips perform different functions, they use a similar method to route instructions in parallel, which is the basis of the Intergraph patents. Parallel processing, used extensively in processors now, was on the cutting edge of research in the early '90s. "The Clipper chip came out of the supercomputing world," an Intergraph representative said. The TI suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the same district as the Dell-Gateway-HP suit and the Itanium suit. TI could not be reached for comment, and Intergraph said the suit has yet to be served on the company.
2002-12-17 - Intergraph sues PC giants over Pentium Intergraph has filed suit against Dell Computer, Gateway and Hewlett-Packard, alleging that the PC companies violated its patents by incorporating Pentium-family processors into their computers. The lawsuit--which could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars and eventually have an impact on every PC maker that used Intel chips in the last seven years--is based on a similar intellectual-property suit launched by Intergraph against Intel that was settled in April this year. In that case, filed in 1997, Intergraph claimed that Intel's Pentium, Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III and other processors infringed on patents embodied in its Clipper chip. Under the settlement, Intel agreed to pay Intergraph $300 million. The deal, however, did not insulate companies that incorporated Intel processors into their computers from suits based on the same patents. The chipmaker is obliged to send a letter to PC makers notifying them of that circumstance, said an Intergraph spokeswoman. If Intergraph's legal arguments hold water, HP and the other PC makers may have to compensate the company for any gain they may have received from selling Intel-based PCs since 1995--through the biggest boom in the history of the computer industry. However, as the case with Intel was settled, no court has ruled on the ultimate validity of Intergraph's Pentium-related patents. Intergraph did not state the amount it was seeking in the current suit. Settlement discussions are under way with PC companies, said an Intergraph spokeswoman. "We are looking at each vendor individually," she said. "We continue to negotiate with people." When asked why IBM was not named as a defendant in the current case, the spokeswoman replied, "We have a close relationship with IBM." In many ways, Intergraph's legal activity underscores the massive changes the Huntsville, Ala.-based company has undergone in the past five years. In the 1980s, the company came to prominence as a workstation manufacturer, competing directly against Sun Microsystems and SGI. Intergraph's workstations were based around its own Clipper microprocessor and graphics technologies. But in late 1993, the company made an abrupt shift, announcing that it would use cheaper Intel chips in its workstations. Subsequently, the first ripples of what would become a massive dispute between Intergraph and Intel appeared. Intergraph accused Intel of violating antitrust laws and of infringing its processor patents. Around the same time, Intergraph exited the hardware market to concentrate on software and services. News.com Special Report Vision Series 3 20 minds on tech's future While the courts threw out Intergraph's antitrust claims, the company's patent infringement claims have fared better. In addition to the Pentium suit, Intergraph won a separate case against Intel that alleged its Itanium chip violated other Intergraph patents. The trial court awarded Intergraph $150 million in that case in July. The suit took place in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the same court that will hear the current dispute. Intel is appealing the Itanium-related case, but will not be allowed to recover the $150 million in any event and may have to pay $100 million more in damages if it loses the appeal. Legal gains Intergraph's revenue from legal activity now rivals its services and software business. In the first nine months of 2002, Intergraph's revenue from services and software came to $379.2 million, with a total of $532 million expected for the year, according to the company. By comparison, its court-mandated payments from Intel alone this year come to $450 million and could rise to $550 million. Earlier this year, Intergraph formed a unit to protect its intellectual property and pursue licensing deals. Recently, Fujitsu entered into a licensing deal with Intergraph connected to the patents underlying the Itanium suit. Obtaining a settlement or a verdict against PC makers, though, will take work. Intergraph's tussle with Intel took years to resolve, for instance. In 1998, a trial court in Alabama ruled that the chipmaker infringed on Intergraph's patents. Subsequently, another court reversed that decision, stating that Intergraph's claims were not valid. Then an appeals court reversed that decision, but did not reinstate the original court's conclusions. Although Intergraph has filed the suit, the spokeswoman was unclear whether it had been filed on the defendants as yet. Representatives from both Dell and HP said they have not seen the suit and could not comment. Gateway did not immediately repsond to requests for comment.
2001-07-31 - Intergraph Intel Itanium violates patent   Software and services company Intergraph has filed a new patent lawsuit against Intel, claiming that the world's largest semiconductor company used patented Intergraph technology in its new line of Itanium high-end server processors. Itanium, based on the IA-64 platform developed by Intel and Hewlett-Packard, was officially launched earlier this year after delays and testing. It uses the EPIC (explicitly parallel instruction computing) instruction set, which the lawsuit claims conflicts with 1993 Intergraph patents relating to instruction routing and parallelism. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court (Eastern District of Texas). Intergraph also filed suit against Intel in 1997, claiming that Intel used Intergraph patents in the Pentium line of processors. The 1997 suit is still awaiting a trial date, and Intergraph says it is unrelated to the Itanium suit. The Alabama-based company and Intel have been involved in a tangle of intellectual property disputes related to a U.S. antitrust investigation. In 1998, for example, a court found that Intel may have violated trust laws by withholding information from Intergraph, only to later reverse the ruling. Intel could not be reached for comment. Intergraph says that Itanium specifically infringes two patents for technology developed in 1992 by Intergraph's Advanced Processor Division for the C5 Clipper microprocessor. The patents cover parallel instruction computing (PIC) techniques used to convey parallelism to hardware and a method of routing instructions to processing units, according to Intergraph. In 1993 Intergraph scrapped development of the C5 Clipper chip in favor of a line of Pentium-based workstations. "Intel's Itanium-based products, which are just now becoming commercially available, infringe upon Intergraph's patented PIC technology, developed almost a decade before Intel introduced the Itanium," said Intergraph Chief Executive Jim Taylor in an official statement. Staff writer Matthew Broersma reported from London.
2004-05-13 - Intergraph Gateway settle Pentium patent suit  Gateway will pay Intergraph at least $10 million to settle a Pentium-related patent-infringement suit, the companies said this week. In addition to the $10 million, Gateway will pay Intergraph royalties of $1.25 each for certain Gateway and eMachines brand PCs sold in the United States (Gateway acquired eMachines in March). The royalty arrangement will be in place till Feb. 2009. The settlement, announced late Wednesday, ends part of a suit filed by Intergraph against Dell, Gateway and Hewlett-Packard in December 2002, which charged that the companies' Intel processor-based PCs infringed on Intergraph chip patents. That suit stemmed from a 1997 filing against Intel, in which Intergraph claimed Intel's Pentium chips violated the processor patents. Intel settled that suit in April 2002 for $300 million, but the agreement didn't preclude Intergraph from suing computer makers who used Pentiums in their products. Intergraph has already settled with Dell, leaving HP as the only party left in the suit. The Dell settlement was dealt with during the resolution of still another suit, this one involving Intel's Itanium processor. Although it's now a software and services company, Intergraph was a prominent manufacturer of high-end desktops called workstations in the 1980s and 1990s. Workstations are used by companies for jobs like computer aided design. Intergraph created its own processor, dubbed Clipper, for the machines it sold. Despite shifting to Intel chips during 1993, the patents Intergraph procured in developing Clipper--patents related to computer memory management--have become the basis for a number of lawsuits the company has filed against others, including Intel, the three PC makers and Texas Instruments. AMD also settled a patent dispute with Intergraph, in April of this year, avoiding a lawsuit. As part of that settlement, AMD agreed to pay as much as $25 million. Settlements related to Intergraph's Clipper patents have brought the Huntsville, Ala., company hundreds of million of dollars, including a total of $675 million from Intel. Gateway's settlement with Intergraph gives the PC maker a license to Intergraph Clipper patents and provides for the resolution of all patent litigation between the two companies, the companies said. "We are pleased to have resolved this component of our OEM (original equipment manufacturer) patent litigation. We are happy with the terms of the Gateway settlement, particularly the future royalty component," Halsey Wise, Intergraph's CEO, said in a statement. A Gateway representative confirmed the terms of the companies' settlement. The royalties paid by Gateway are likely to be small as they cover only those Gateway systems that incorporate Intel processors but use non-Intel motherboards and chipsets. Most of Gateway's Intel processor PCs also use Intel chipsets and motherboards, the representative said. Intergraph plans to continue to pursue its patent case against HP. That case is set to go to trial Aug. 2, Intergraph said.

2009-05-21 - Intel's Tukwila slips yet again    Intel has slipped out a revised schedule for its next-generation Itanium processor, code-named Tukwila. Again. This time it's into 2010. Intel released a statement Thursday on the schedule changes. It reads in part: During final system-level testing, we identified an opportunity to further enhance application scalability best optimized for high-end systems. This will result in a change to the Tukwila shipping schedule to Q1 2010. In addition to better meeting the needs of our current Itanium customers, we believe this change will allow Tukwila systems a greater opportunity to gain share versus proprietary RISC solutions including Sparc and IBM Power. Tukwila is tracking to 2x performance vs its predecessor chip. This change is about delivering even further application scalability for mission critical workloads. That may be true. However, the fact remains that this is yet another delay to the program. This will put Tukwila's introduction more than two years after the debut of the current "Montvale" generation--which itself was a delayed and modest speedbump to "Montecito"--and one that Intel barely announced publicly. Tukwila has had an especially bumpy history. This generation of Itanium processor began life as a chip project code-named Tanglewood and was said to be envisioned as a radical multicore design by the ex-Digital Equipment Alpha engineers who worked on it. First, Intel changed the code-name to Tukwila after the Tanglewood Music Festival complained. This was back in 2003--to give you an idea of how long this particular project has been weaving its way through development. At that time, it was slated for something in the neighborhood of a 2007 release. Then the chip apparently went through a variety of significant design changes. It will still be the first Itanium to sport Intel's serial processor communications link (QuickPath Interconnect--QPI) and integrated memory controllers. Those are both major enhancements, but otherwise Tukwila is a more conventional quad-core evolution of current Itanium designs. It will also be manufactured with a 65-nanometer process instead of the denser 45-nanometer process already used by the newest Intel Xeon CPUs. Along the way, the chip's schedule has been publicly pushed back a number of times, now to early 2010. As a practical matter, delays to Itanium matter less to Intel and the server makers that use it (meaning Hewlett-Packard first and foremost) than in the case of x86 Xeon, where a delay of a few months can have a major revenue impact--vis-a-vis Advanced Micro Device's Barcelona. Buyers of high-end servers like HP's Superdome and NonStop value vendor relationships, reliability, and a wide range of enterprise-class capabilities far more than they do the last drop of performance. HP has done a good job of things like leveraging its c-Class BladeSystem infrastructure for its Itanium-based Integrity servers and putting together systematic go-to-market programs with partners such as SAP. Nonetheless, at some point, ongoing delays have to hurt competitiveness--especially given how IBM's Power systems have been hitting on all cylinders the past few years.

Now that is exciting!" he said to the roomful of astonished onlookers. Although Fister, a senior vice president and general manager of Intel's Enterprise Platform group, can joke about the often arcane world of back-end computing systems--he's dead serious when it comes to expanding Intel's share of that highly competitive business market. Indeed, Intel has come to dominate the market for servers with four or fewer processors with its Xeon chip. With Fister, Intel has begun driving deeper into the server business as it attempts to drive rivals Sun Microsystems and IBM toward the fringes. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has braved slow acceptance for its Itanium chip. An upcoming processor called Madison, however, may begin to speed customer adoption. Madison performs about 50 percent better than its predecessor and, so far, early indications show that more PC makers are adopting it. Fister's challenge will be to win faster acceptance. To achieve this goal, Intel will need to work more closely with the chip's users and the software community to help them adapt to the new processor. That's the sort of thing that Sun has done for years but a task that Intel has traditionally left to computer makers. Fister, who joined Intel when DOS (Disk Operating System) ruled the PC world, recently sat down with CNET News.com to discuss Itanium and Intel's other chip plans. Q: This is shaping up to be a server summer for Intel. What's on tap? A: We've got another version of Gallatin (the current Xeon) coming, and Madison will debut exactly where we said it would two years ago. We've got some very exciting big OEM (original equipment manufacturer) systems coming out. And we're moving up in the top 500 (supercomputer) list. There's lots and lots of Intel architecture-based clusters--a lot of Itanium, a few Xeons. Itanium sales haven't been the greatest, but interest among computer makers seems to be growing with Madison. Is this because the performance is better, or is there more software now? There's always been a dearth of applications, according to some. The performance is, on par, better than anyone thought it would be, and the applications mix keeps moving up. We have more than 300 production release (applications) out now--and they are the big ones. A cheat sheet to Intel's plans for the server market Madison Aka: A new version of the Itanium 2; successor of McKinley. Features: 1.5GHz; 3MB to 6MB of cache memory. Details: Set to launch June 30, say sources. Gallatin Aka: Xeon for servers with four or more processors. Features: 2GHz; a faster version is expected June 30. Details: A version with 4MB of cache is expected later in year. Deerfield Aka: Low-voltage Itanium 2 for blade servers. Features: 1GHz; 1.5MB of cache; planned for second half of 2003. Details: Costs less and is more energy-efficient than Madison. Prescott Aka: An overhaul of the Pentium 4. Features: 1MB of cache memory; more than 3GHz; claims better multimedia and uses LaGrande security technology. Details: Plans to compete with AMD's Athlon64. Nocona Aka: A 2004 Xeon for one- or two-processor boxes. Features: Has the same chip core as that of Prescott. Details: Paired with the Lindenhurst chipset. Potomac Aka: A version of Nocona for servers with four-plus processors. Features: Large cache memory. Details: Scheduled for launch in 2004. Sources: Intel and others They are in the target areas: databases, business intelligence; supply chain management; ERP (enterprise resource planning), of course. What you see more and more of is testimonials from end users and different verticals. With Itanium--and to a lesser degree the high-end Xeons--is the issue of volume. Intel has historically sold chips in very high volumes. When you talk about large monolithic systems with 32 processors, we're talking about a lower-volume, higher-cost product. Are there any changes that Intel has had to make in order to deal with that difference? The process developers make it pretty seamless for us product guys to do that. We chunk them out in the same fabs. The biggest structural change took place more than three years ago, when we said: "Hey, to really drive the penetration into this part of the market, we have to be more solutions-aware." We then dramatically increased the number of people who touch the software industry. We do a lot more end-customer engagement. When I go out, I do high-performance computing roundtables with people from NASA and whoever else. We talk to CIOs and CFOs at retail and financial institutions. I was talking to an analyst a few weeks ago who was grousing that, given the humongous amount of cache on Madison (6MB) and the fact that Intel got to start from scratch with the EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) architecture, you should have a much bigger performance gap over existing architectures. Whomever you are talking about may be using a little bit of both sides of their mouth. McKinley (the current version of Itanium) has beaten everything that has been around for ten years. That's pretty impressive. And most of the techno-cognoscenti have said that's pretty neat...I won't even tell you what we are doing with the guys who came across from the Alpha development. That is an intact team working on a middle-of-the-decade Itanium family processor. Weren't they working on Montecito, the dual-core version of Itanium? No. They are working on one after that. I haven't told you the name of it yet. Maybe when we do the Madison launch. The development effort is rooted in the guys who were working on EV8. What happened to Chivano? That was slated to follow Montecito earlier. Chivano and the Montecito kind of came together to become what's now Montecito. The EV8 guys were working on some fairly sophisticated multithreading. Are you going to continue to evolve that? Threading is a big idea for the company. One of the more interesting things about the server part of the business is that it is a technology incubation ground. You take new technologies and pilot them and prove them to the industry, and then they waterfall their way down to the desktops--and then to the notebooks and, ultimately, to the handheld computers. It is also another example of why we need to work with the end user community more and more: We are creating more computer process technology than we have historically. How so? Back 20-something years ago, when I was working on the 8086 as a design guy, we could look at IBM mainframes and look at hints about what you should do. I guarantee you that the IA-32 product line lives for a long time yet. As time has moved along, knowing exactly what to do has become less and less obvious. The EV8 also contained an integrated Rambus memory controller. I don't know if we will see exactly that in the future, but what do you think of integrated controllers in general? Are they a good idea? They can be, but timing is everything. We obviously have looked at it and haven't done it yet, because the memory technology evolves faster than the micro core--and when you get out of synch, that is a problem. And I think that somebody in the industry will figure out that that is a problem--somebody who has already done it. (AMD put an integrated memory controller on Opteron.) We haven't said whether we would or wouldn't do it, but it is a natural thing to think about. Just like putting cache on a die is something we said we would do--or multi-core integration. Some people have done it already. Why? It was the only way they could drive performance. When we do it, I bet that it will make sense to you. You've got to not only look at the speed characteristics, but also at the power characteristics of the process. The EV8 guys were talking about a part that would run in excess of 200 watts. It is almost beyond practical. When we do it, it isn't going to do that. We are holding a power threshold. It takes a ton of work. What do you think of Sun's Afara technology--the multi-core, multi-thread chip they have coming out? Well, you know, too much of a good thing doesn't do anything for you. I read it with curiosity and interest. Right now, the natural thread limits in a Microsoft environment are about 64, and in a Unix environment, it's 128 or 256. The tricky part is that you've got to work with the applications industry in order to be able to understand where you are going so that they can write applications that will use that kind of capacity. In some respects, you seed the industry and pour some water on it, and maybe a tree happens. That is an extremely complex task. For someone to go out there with many hundreds of threads of capability--it is awe-inspiring to think about how that can work. How big is the opportunity for Itanium? It's made to take on the Unix market, which Gartner says this year will be less than half of the server revenue and about 18 percent of the units. It is shrinking and shrinking, partly because of your own 32-bit chips. It's a place where we have the opportunity to gain market share. It is also a place where the revenue for the computing elements--servers and storage--is absolutely huge. Even though it is a relatively small unit volume, it is mega, mega billions of dollars of capital equipment. It is also a technology incubation area. I don't know when--maybe a while yet--but if history is right, that technology incubator sometimes finds a crossover. You seed the industry and pour some water on it, and maybe a tree happens. That is an extremely complex task. So someday, the Itanium processor family has the opportunity to cross over with our IA-32 line and take a large part of that segment. You can see that we are expanding the breadth of the product and creating more overlap. You mean Deerfield, the low-power, inexpensive version of Madison? That is the first indication of it. You drive the breadth of the product line, and you get overlap with some of it. Boy, I don't know when or if the client ever needs 64 bits, but servers--if that technology gets wide applications--could use it. If you are ever going to drive overlap, you've got to be able to drive price consistency. People who think that Itanium is "niched up" in the high-end forever because of the size of the die or the power are wrong. Do you expect to extend the physical addressing technology in Xeon? Right now it goes to 36 bits, which lets you have 64GB of memory. Will you extend that again or will you let Itanium encroach from above? That's an often-asked question. We've kind of been guarded about all of the architectural features in the next generation of Xeon. But that it is a leap you shouldn't make, to say that the only benefit of Itanium is the 64-bit physical addressing. It is a cleaner sheet of paper. It works around some of the deficiencies that people have historically pointed out (with IA-32 chips): There is a limited number of registers and not enough arithmetic capability in the product--how do you involve the RAS features of components? I guarantee you that the IA-32 product line lives for a long time yet. The coolest facet of it is the threaded technology. We have some virtualizing technology coming. You just started to see that with LaGrande (a coming security feature), and there's more stuff there. Let's take a walk down memory lane for a second. Back in 1991 or so, when Intel was debating what to do, the development group in Oregon said it could extend the 32-bit family to 64 bits while a group in Santa Clara recommended to go with what became Itanium. What were the reasons that Intel tipped for Itanium back then? It was a hotly contended subject. The question was: How could we continue to find ways to evolve a 32-bit architecture? Is there a way to live with the legacy and the artifacts of the architecture? You know--only so many addresses, segmentation in the addressing, bladee, bladee, blah. Could you do that and do like we did with the P6? The P6 family is a marvel. I am proud to be associated with it. We took core elements and pretty much dropped out the parts that became the Pentium III, the Xeon and even the Celeron. That was pretty cool. The question is: How could you keep doing that in an environment where desktops and big computers are diverging? It is complicated. The desktop continues to have pricing pressure on it, and with big computers like servers, you continue to evolve into the niche of a niche. I think we came to the realization that, to do that, we are really going to have to let our lines diverge--and you are going to have to build these kinds of dedicated server processors, make the leap to some new technology generation, and hope that some day it crosses back over. But there was the problem of software incompatibility. Did people draw straws and say, "OK, Craig, you are the loser in this one. You go tell the developers that they have to rewrite their apps." I don't know. I wasn't an Itanium guy in the beginning. I was on the other side. I was the 32-bit guy, and we had very powerful arguments on how we were evolving it. The company intelligently embraced the reality that we would have to do an architectural transition and include the software industry--and we seeded this with fundamental technology around compilers. I'm curious how important you think the IA-32 Execution Layer, which lets you run IA-32 code on an Itanium, will be. As you target crossover, or a consolidated environment, your future server may run some legacy code that you don't want to convert to native. I'm a student of history. Mainframes are running 20-year-old Cobol code for which the developer is nonexistent. Hell, he may have left the company or retired. You don't even know the genealogy of it--you just know that it works. So we had compatibility mode in hardware in the first members of the Itanium family, and what we have come to show you is that we have been working on something else. It is a software environment that can progress with the evolution of the components. Because the compatibility wasn't great. The compatibility was great. The performance was, uh, limited. We have some real clever ideas for how to augment the hardware in a different way.

2007-09-18 - Intel's Otellini has company focused on low power  With the next two generations of Intel's chips set in place, the company is looking forward to a low-power future. So said Intel CEO Paul Otellini in his keynote address kicking off the Intel Developer Forum at San Francisco's Moscone Center on Tuesday. Intel will launch the server and high-end desktop versions of its Penryn generation of chips on November 12, in line with previous reports to expect those chips before the Thanksgiving holiday. And Intel has also completed the design for Nehalem, a more radical overhaul of the company's chip blueprints. The more interesting news was Otellini's goals for Intel over the rest of the decade. The company plans to ship a generation of processors on its 45-nanometer manufacturing technology by 2009 that come with graphics integrated right onto the processor, similar to what rival Advanced Micro Devices has planned for its Fusion chips. Intel will be investing in a joint venture with KDDI, a Japanese telecom company, with plans to build a WiMax network in Japan. And as expected, Intel talked up its low-power chips for MIDs (Mobile Internet Devices), with plans to reduce the power consumption of its handheld computer chips by a factor of 10 compared with the Silverthorne processor, expected next year. This is all part of Intel's search for growth, which has meandered a bit this decade. Still, you've got to have a strategy for the future, especially as the PC market matures over the next five to 10 years. That appears to have three legs: first of all, don't squander the base market of PC and server processors. To accomplish that, Otellini has implemented a more gradual series of manufacturing transitions that makes sure the company doesn't try to introduce a new architecture with a new manufacturing technology, and that it doesn't go too long in between revisions to its chips. The hope is that this prevents AMD from catching it napping and losing significant chunks of market share, which is probably the best description of the years from 2002 to 2006. Intel CEO Paul Otellini addresses hardware developers and the media to kick off the 2007 Intel Developer Forum. Tom Krazit/CNET News.com The second is graphics. AMD is forcing Intel's hand a bit in this area, with its purchase of ATI Technologies last year and the resulting plans for Fusion. Intel ships more graphics technology than anybody else on the planet, but that's only because it ships so many low-cost integrated graphics chipsets in desktops and notebooks, not because that graphics technology is extremely compelling. But the company wants to improve its performance in that area, hiring engineers and purchasing companies like Havok to improve its hardware and software expertise in graphics technology. And in the long term, Intel will attack the graphics market by accelerating the pace at which it develops graphics technology by using its most advanced manufacturing processes. Historically, Intel's integrated graphics products used older manufacturing technology too antiquated for cutting-edge processors, but that's changing. In 2009 Intel will ship a processor that has 45nm graphics technology built onto the chip, and in 2010 it will introduce a chip for which both the CPU and the graphics technology were designed for the 32nm manufacturing technology slated for production during that timeframe, Otellini said. And for the high end of the market, and possibly the discrete graphics market currently owned by Nvidia and ATI, Intel will produce a processor called Larrabee with many configurable cores and a shared cache memory. Otellini said Intel will demonstrate Larabee in 2008, but didn't share launch plans. The third area of focus is mobility. Intel wants to be part of whatever design becomes the most popular mobile device. Having shed its ambitions for mobile phones, it now plans to compete directly against the smart phone industry with the MID, sort of a handheld notebook PC that hasn't really attracted much interest as of yet. In 2008 Intel will introduce Silverthorne, and beyond that an x86 processor called Moorestown for low-power devices like MIDs. There's no evidence at all that people want MIDs right now, but Otellini thinks that if Intel continues to reduce the power consumption of its chips, the designs and software for MIDs will continue to improve. Those devices will have to connect to the Internet somehow to compete against smart phones that use cellular networks for voice and data. And Intel thinks that network will be WiMax. The company is working with Sprint and Clearwire to get WiMax service going in the U.S., and it will hit Japan with WiMax as part of its joint venture with KDDI. So that's what Otellini said. As always, it's interesting to note what he didn't say. He didn't mention Microsoft once during his presentation, at least that I noticed. He didn't mention Viiv or any of Intel's previous efforts to develop PCs for the living room. And Itanium seems to have finally crawled offstage, at least as far as the CEO is concerned. Keynote speeches later today from Pat Gelsinger and tomorrow from Dadi Perlmutter and Anand Chandrasekher might clear up some of those questions, but it's always interesting to see what the CEO's priorities are during one of his biggest speeches of the year. Stay tuned for more coverage of IDF, including a talk later today with Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, and much more on the future of mobile devices tomorrow.
2000-08-23 - Intel's new Itanium chip drags its feet    SAN JOSE, Calif.--Intel said most of its initial Itanium chips will run at 733 MHz, slower than the 800 MHz expected, but the company also announced today a host of other high-end computer products to compensate for the disappointment. Most Itaniums are expected to ship at the lower speed, Mike Fister, general manager of Intel's enterprise platforms group, said during a news conference at the Intel Developer Forum. Intel will start selling the chip in the fourth quarter of 2000, said spokeswoman Christine Chartier. The chip's speed is a lesser factor than architectural improvements such as the 64-bit design that allows it to hold vast databases within memory, said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. But the slower speed indicates difficulties with the manufacturing process for the large new chip. "Clearly there's a problem there. You always love for the distribution to favor the high end," Brookwood said. However, he added, "I don't think the megahertz rating on the initial Itanium is going to be very important in the broad scheme of things." Intel servers are growing up but still have a long way to go before they can be used to attack the entire product line of Sun Microsystems, which has become Intel's biggest rival. The delayed Itanium chip has been the flagship of Intel's effort to unseat Sun's dominant 64-bit UltraSparc-based Unix servers. Intel emphasizes several uses for its Itanium chip and successors in the IA-64 line. Among those uses are encrypting and decrypting information, analyzing large quantities of business data and housing large databases, Fister said. Currently there are about 6,000 prototype Itanium computers being tested, with chip speeds generally running at 500, 666 and 733 MHz, he said. While IA-64 is the point of Intel's attack on Sun, Intel is expected have more immediate success with extensions to its current 32-bit line. In servers, the 32-bit line is topped by Xeon chips, which feature larger on-board high-speed "cache" memory than ordinary Pentiums and the ability to be grouped into servers with as many as four processors. Just as a Pentium 4 is coming out this fall, a high-end Xeon equivalent code-named Foster also is due, Intel has said in the past. Today, though, the company talked about another new model, called Gallatin. Gallatin is built on the 0.13-micron manufacturing process, a smaller feature size that enables Intel to build chips that are faster and less expensive. It's the high-end parallel to Northwood, the successor to the 0.18-micron Pentium 4. Like Xeon, Gallatin will have a range of cache sizes, Fister said. The first Gallatin chips will come with smaller caches, with larger caches coming later. But where Xeon chips top out at 2MB caches, Gallatin will be larger, Fister indicated. Brookwood said 4MB would be the likely cache size. "That's a lot of transistors," he said. Current large-cache Xeons have 140 million transistors, the tiny electronic components that make up chips, Fister said. IBM's upcoming Power4 chip, which crams two CPUs in a single chip along with a large cache, uses 170 million transistors. But CPUs are only half the game when it comes to building servers, Fister said. Where desktop computer performance is strongly influenced by the CPU horsepower, servers require fast connections to memory and input-output systems for network cards and storage. The chips that handle these tasks are called chipsets. "It's like a race car. If you drop a 1,000-horsepower engine into a Yugo, you'll burn the tires off it," Fister said. For Foster workstations, which are essentially gussied-up desktops, Intel will offer the 870 chipset, Fister said. But for Foster servers--expected to be a much larger market--Intel will rely on ServerWorks and other third-party manufacturers, he said. However, Foster servers won't debut until the second quarter of 2001--a full quarter after the workstations, Fister said. The first Foster servers will be dual processor-capable machines, with four-way, eight-way and higher arriving in the third quarter of 2001. Concurrent with the arrival of Gallatin in "early 2002" will be Intel's reentry into the server-chipset market with a new system called Plumas, Fister said. This chipset will enable two-processor servers and is timed to take advantage of mainstream adoption of the InfiniBand high-speed system to connect CPUs with storage, networks and other servers, Fister said.
2002-06-12 - Intel's new Itanium 2 fit and trimmer  Itanium 2, Intel's upcoming chip for high-end servers and workstations, has slimmed down. The final version of the chip, which goes on sale in a few weeks, will have a surface area of 421 square millimeters--approximately 10 percent smaller than originally planned. The reduction in size comes because of subsequent manufacturing improvements, an Intel representative said. Although it remains a relatively large processor, the slimmed-down chip will give Intel a little extra breathing room on costs and manufacturing. In February, Intel representatives said the chip would measure 464 square millimeters, which would have made it one of the largest chips in years. Large chips cost more to make because fewer can be carved out of a single silicon wafer. Yields--the number of good chips produced from a wafer--also typically decline as chip size increases because of a greater potential for defects, according to analysts. "Dropping a few additional square millimeters will up yields in both die size and defect density," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at consulting firm Mercury Research. Itanium 2, which once went by the code-name McKinley, is perhaps Intel's most crucial product release this year. The chip processes data in 64-bit chunks, like IBM's Power4 and Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc III. Other Intel chips, including the Xeon processor line for servers, consume data in 32-bit chunks. Among other performance benefits, 64-bit chips let server manufacturers incorporate far more memory into their machines, which is crucial for running large databases. Naturally, 64-bit chips and servers sell for far more than their 32-bit counterparts. The first Itanium chip, though, has been a commercial dud. Delayed several times, the processor found few takers among computer manufacturers or corporate buyers. Middling performance, a lack of software and a declining economy also hurt Itanium, according to executives and analysts. Intel and others, though, assert that the experience with Itanium 2 will be different. The chip will provide twice the performance of the first Itanium, according to Intel. IBM, Hewlett-Packard, NEC and other manufacturers have also invested heavily to develop servers, chipsets and other technology for Itanium 2 servers. A greater number of operating systems and databases will also be appearing around the time the Itanium 2 comes out. Demand "has been picking up, but we're still talking tens of thousands of units," or substantially less than the Xeon line, said McCarron. The chip, originally due in 2001, will likely debut shortly after July 14. HP is coming out with a version of Unix for the chip in the third week of July, which begins on that day. Intel has said the chip is due midyear. If the chip finds buyers, Intel, in tandem with server makers, will be able to snatch customers away from Sun and possibly grab the lead position in every segment of the processor market. But Intel also faces competition from Advanced Micro Devices in the server field. Intel's cross-freeway rival is coming out with a server chip called Opteron next year that can handle both 32-bit and 64-bit software, and will cost less to manufacture, according to AMD. Until recently, AMD did not participate in the server market. Sizing it up The size of the Itanium 2 is the result of a number of factors. The chip, which is made on the 180-nanometer manufacturing process, contains a substantial amount of cache--data reservoirs near the processor for rapid access. Intel is integrating a 3MB Level 3 cache, a 256KB Level 2 cache and a 32KB Level 1 cache. The original Itanium features a 4MB Level 3 cache, although it's located on separate chips, and a 96KB Level 2 cache. Itanium 2 also contains more internal subsystems than its predecessor. In all, the chip contains 221 million transistors. The chip will run at 1GHz when it debuts. Although it is only coming to market now, successors are already in the works. In 2003, the company will unveil Madison, a "shrink" of the Itanium 2 made on the more advanced 130-nanometer manufacturing process. Though smaller, Madison will be based on the same design as the Itanium 2. Deerfield, a low-power, cheaper Itanium chip, is also on the horizon. In 2004, Intel expects to come out with Montecito, the successor to Madison, and follow it in the 2005 to 2006 time frame with Chivano, Montecito's successor, according to sources.
2002-04-25 - Intel's new bag of chips   Optimism was the main message from Intel CEO Craig Barrett during the company's annual analyst conference Thursday, as he and other executives introduced plans for new chips and improved chipmaking processes. In the face of a down economy, Barrett showed how the leading chipmaker was focusing on building technology for the future. Some of the specifics he outlined were plans for a number of new processors, including the Itanium 2 server chip, expected in the second half of 2002, and Banias, the code name for a new notebook chip due in early 2003. He emphasized that Intel would see revenue growth this year, although the precise timing of when technology companies would resume spending was still unclear. Barrett said that even though the economy may be weak, the growth of the Internet and the infrastructure needed to support it will help bolster the industry at large. And because of this, technology companies still need to work and create with an eye toward the future. "Technology doesn't stop during recessionary periods," Barrett said. Also at the meeting, executives outlined several important manufacturing technology transitions, including the company's move to producing 130-nanometer chips on new 300-millimeter wafers. The move from 180-nanometer chips to 130-nanometer chips will allow the company to increase chip clock speed and reduce power consumption. The move to larger 300-millimeter wafers, the basic unit of chip production, allows chipmakers to produce about 2.5 times more chips per wafer, increasing production volume. It can also reduce per-chip manufacturing costs considerably. By the end of the year, Intel hopes to have six factories making chips on 300-millimeter wafers, which it says will lower its manufacturing costs about 35 percent. And for 2004, the company is looking at moving to manufacturing 90-nanometer chips. Intel executives said that the company has resurrected Fab 24, a manufacturing plant being constructed in Ireland. Fab 24 was scheduled to open in the second half of 2001, but Intel postponed the opening amid a PC market slowdown in 2001. Intel now plans to open the plant in 2004 to support a 90-nanometer chip manufacturing line that uses 300-millimeter wafers. Itanium, part two The Itanium 2 is the successor to Intel's current 800MHz Itanium server chip and the second chip to use the company's 64-bit technology. Due in the second half of the year, the Itanium 2 will offer higher clock speeds and significantly improved performance over the current chip, Intel has said. The chip will be introduced at midyear at 1GHz and will ship in high-end servers and workstations used to store large databases or compute mechanical designs. Meanwhile, Paul Otellini, Intel's president and chief operating officer, walked investors through a host of new desktop and mobile Pentium 4 chip introductions the company has planned. He started with a demonstration of the forthcoming Banias chip, a low-power mobile processor due in the first quarter of 2003. The chip will offer competitive clock speeds along with a new chipset that integrates 802.11 wireless networking capabilities. The combination of the two will help notebook makers cut power consumption by about 25 percent, Otellini said. Otellini also gave an update on the company's desktop and notebook Pentium 4 plans. The desktop chip, now running at 2.4GHz, will hit 2.53GHz later this quarter and 3GHz during the fourth quarter, he said. The 2.53GHz Pentium 4 will bring an increase in bus speed, from 400MHz to 533MHz, which will boost desktop PC performance. The bus provides a data pipeline between the processor and RAM (random access memory). "We remain on track for a 3GHz launch in the fourth quarter of this year," Otellini said. Intel will begin transitioning its Celeron chip to Netburst, the chip architecture of the Pentium 4, later this quarter. By the end of the year, about 80 percent of its Celeron chips will be based on the newer architecture. "This allows us substantial gigahertz headroom," Otellini said, which should allow the company to keep the chip competitive with Advanced Micro Devices' Duron processor. On the notebook side, Intel's mobile Pentium 4-M chip will hit 2GHz by midyear, Otellini said. Intel just this week bumped the chip from 1.7GHz to 1.8GHz. More to come Intel also plans to begin shipping small quantities of its Wireless Internet on a Chip to partners for testing during the second half of the year. The Wireless Internet on a Chip processor technology, first announced last May, combines the duties of a processor, memory and a DSP (digital signal processor) in a single chip. Intel has said the new chip, which can do everything from application processing to storing data and refining analog signals, should help device makers cut costs and reduce power consumption. These benefits could then lead to smaller handsets with longer battery life, for example. Intel has not yet announced pricing on the chip. Meanwhile, as an interim step, Intel will offer new chip packages that allow device makers to put several chips in the same space by stacking them on top of one another.
2005-01-26 - Intel's mystery mark sparks intrigue   Recent trademark filings from Intel are raising speculation that the world's largest chip maker may be preparing to create a new global brand. The question is, what does VIIV mean? "Intel Inside VIIV" and "Intel VIIV" were filed as U.S. trademarks last month by the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker, known for its Pentium and Centrino brands. A square graphic, resembling an inkblot or a starfield, was also filed around the same time. Intel watchers have a few hypotheses on the meaning of VIIV. One is that the letters are Roman numerals standing for 6 and 4, as in 64-bit technology, a feature that Intel is introducing in its chips this year. Another is that VIIV will appear in a more stylized form as the logo for the company's new dual-core chips, which are the equivalent of two chips in one. Two letter Vs, separated by two lines, could represent the two cores of a Pentium 5 chip. Of course, the trademark for VIIV, which Intel also filed in Asia and Europe, could be something else altogether, or nothing at all. (Intel's rival Advanced Micro Devices filed trademarks for Forton, Adepton, Tegron, Metaron, and Vanton but doesn't making chips with those brand names.) Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy declined comment, saying Intel doesn't discuss unannounced brands or trademarks. But that hasn't stopped chip industry pundits from expressing intrigue. "I think whoever it was flunked Roman numerals in grade school," said Nathan Brookwood, the head of technology consulting firm Insight 64. Brookwood says he thinks VIIV stands for 64-bit technology. "When your name is Insight 64, you're looking for 64 all over the place," he said. Still, the proper representation of 64 is LXIV, he pointed out. Charlie Glavin, an analyst with Needham & Co., prefers the dual-core theory. "I'm thinking of it as far as a dual-core, V-V," he said. Microprocessors, the central chip in computers, are among the most complex products ever produced by humankind, composed of hundreds of millions of microscopic switches. So complicated, in fact, that chipmakers like Intel and AMD increasingly shy away from bothering to explain the technical aspects of the chip, instead focusing their efforts on brand names dreamed up by Madison Avenue. Centrino, Intel's most recently introduced chip brand for notebook PCs, "suggests flight, mobility and forward movement," according to Intel marketing materials. (Centrino is also the Italian word for "doily," a reference duly noted by Intel in its trademark application.) In fact, Centrino isn't even a chip, but a "platform" brand for three chips, one more complicated than the next. But that hasn't kept it from market acceptance, with many PC shoppers asking by name for notebooks powered by Centrino. The Intel Inside campaign is another example of the power of branding, making it clear that PC shoppers are getting an Intel, even if they don't quite know why that's a good thing. Chip names can also backfire, as Intel is well aware. Intel's Itanium chip, its most powerful microprocessor, earned the derogatory nickname "Itanic" after its lack of market acceptance had some critics treating it as a sinking ship.

2007-10-31 - Intel's Montvale Itanium chip arrives  Intel announced on Wednesday its line of Itanium products for high-end computing servers. Code-named Montvale, the chip is an update to Montecito, the dual-core Itanium 2 chip that was launched in July last year, Eddie Toh, regional platform marketing manager of the Server Platforms Group for Asia-Pacific at Intel, said in an interview on Monday. Originally due in 2006, the launch of Montvale has been held up until now. Like Montecito, the new Itanium chip is based on a manufacturing process with circuitry dimensions of 90 nanometers, and has two processor cores. Montvale, also known as the Itanium 9100 processor series, ships in seven iterations consisting of six dual-core chips and a single-core chip, Toh said. Comparing Montvale to the existing Itanium 9000 processor series, Toh said the new chip has three new features. The first new feature--core-level lockstep--is said to strengthen the Itanium platform's support for mission-critical applications, as it "improves the data integrity and reliability of applications by eliminating undetected errors in the core." Coupled with the existing socket-level lockstep technology, the core-level lockstep feature enables "greater reliability, availability, and serviceability by guaranteeing that calculation results are consistent among the cores and sockets," Intel said. The second new feature is a power-management feature known as "demand-based switching," or DBS, Toh said. It reduces power consumption by servers during low CPU-utilization periods. According to Toh, the third feature is an increase in the front-side bus performance by up to 667MHz, which means applications that demand greater bandwidth can run faster. In addition, the 9100 processor series has a clock speed of up to 1.66GHz. Toh added that, based on Intel's own lab tests, Montvale has almost a 19 percent performance gain over Montecito at similar frequencies. This is due to the additional bandwidth provided by the faster system bus. Tukwila, the next generation of Itanium chips, based on the 65nm process, is expected to arrive sometime in 2008 or 2009, while the 32nm Poulson is expected in 2010 or 2011.Lynn Tan of ZDNet Asia reported from Singapore.
2002-02-04 - Intel's McKinley is one big chip   McKinley, Intel's upcoming server processor, will be huge, at least in terms of surface area. The processor, which will come out commercially toward the middle of this year, will cover an area of 464 square millimeters, according to Intel specifications. That's larger than expected and larger than most chips ever made. As a result, the chip won't be the easiest or the cheapest product Intel has ever produced. Big chips cost more to make because fewer can be carved out of a single wafer. Yields--the number of good chips produced from a wafer--also typically decline as chip size increases because of the greater potential for defects. "It's a pretty big die," said Kevin Krewell, an analyst at the Microprocessor Report. "It is definitely a challenge to manufacture." Another analyst said, "Jesus, that's big." McKinley is the second member of the Itanium processor family and will be followed by Madison, Montecito and Chivano, among others. The size of the chip comes from a number of factors. McKinley contains a substantial amount of cache--data reservoirs near the processor for rapid data access. Intel is integrating a 3MB level three cache, a 256KB level two cache and a 32KB level one cache. The original Itanium features a 4MB level three cache, although it's located on separate chips, and a 96KB level two cache. McKinley also contains more internal subsystems than its predecessor. In all, the chip contains 221 million transistors. All the additional circuitry will help McKinley achieve a large performance boost, said John Crawford, an Intel fellow in the enterprise platforms group. McKinley will run at 1GHz, he added. Intel on Monday will present a paper on McKinley at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco. "Applications will be about one and a half to two times faster than what you get on a (current) Itanium," he said. Gartner analyst Martin Reynolds says McKinley will still be economically feasible to manufacture--even though it appears to be at the size limits of high-volume technology. see commentary Intel has also incorporated a substantial amount of redundant circuitry in the processor, Krewell said. Chipmakers often use redundant circuitry to boost yields. Sometimes, circuits come out scrambled on a finished chip. If the manufacturer has put in two sets of the same circuits, the chip will function properly because it can use the second set. The size of McKinley won't likely represent a huge drain on costs for Intel. While McKinley is expected to be popular, server chip volumes are relatively low. Intel may make only a few hundred thousand McKinley chips in 2002 and sell them for several thousand dollars. Instead, the size effectively means that the chip will cost more to produce than other Intel chips. How big is it? Krewell said it's the second-largest chip he's heard of, second only to a Hewlett-Packard PA-RISC chip from a few years ago. Each McKinley could cost $300 to produce, compared with $50 for some members of the Pentium family. Only about 47 McKinleys will be able to be carved from a standard wafer. Intel now carves about 180 of the latest Pentium 4s from a single wafer. McKinley's acceptance is a major issue for the hardware industry. The chip, which digests data in 64-bit chunks rather than 32-bit chunks like most Intel chips, will be placed in servers that compete against servers from Sun Microsystems and others. Although the first Itanium sold only sparingly, Intel, IBM, HP and others harbor far higher hopes for McKinley. The chip provides better performance than its predecessor and is expected to sell in far larger numbers. The ultimate success of McKinley, though, will depend on the availability of software. Microsoft, Oracle and a number of other software developers have committed to delivering products for McKinley. Still, it is uncertain when customers will gravitate to these new products in the current economic climate. Intel is already preparing successors to the chip. In 2003, the company will unveil Madison, a successor to McKinley, and Deerfield, a low-power, cheaper Itanium chip. Madison will effectively be a "shrink" of McKinley. Rather than get manufactured on the 180-nanometer process, Madison will feature circuits measuring 130 nanometers. The shift will reduce the size of the chip dramatically. In 2004, the company will come out with Montecito, the successor to Madison, and follow it in the 2005-2006 time frame with Chivano, Montecito's successor. Both Montecito and Chivano will contain influences from Compaq's Alpha chip, according to sources.
2002-09-06 - Intel's Madison chip on parade Server makers Unisys and NEC are expected to provide the first public demonstrations of "Madison," Intel's third-generation Itanium processor, at Intel's Developer Forum on Monday. Demonstrations of new processors under carefully controlled circumstances, while a far cry from actual sales, are an important milestone in bringing a new product to market. That importance is elevated for the Itanium line, an unproven and ambitious product family with complex features needed for top-of-the-line servers often using dozens of processors. The demonstrations Monday, slated for Intel President Paul Otellini's opening keynote address at the Intel Developer Forum, will show off features designed to appeal to high-end customers, according to a source familiar with the plan. NEC will show a Madison system with 32 processors running SAP's business software, while Unisys will demonstrate upgrading four Itanium 2 processors to Madison processors, a process that will take place without disturbing software running in a separate 12-processor section of the server, sources said. Unisys said in an advisory it would demonstrate a Madison server but didn't comment further. NEC didn't respond to requests for comment. The Itanium family is the central element of Intel's effort to crack the market for high-end servers, the computers that run demanding, round-the-clock jobs such as tracking a company's inventory and sales. While Intel processors are used in huge numbers of lower-end servers, IBM, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard dominate the high-end market with servers using their own processors. Sales of Itanium 2 have thus far been lackluster. Market research firm Gartner projects that in 2007, Itanium server sales are projected to reach $4.4 billion, while Sun's UltraSparc-based servers will be at $6 billion and IBM's Power-based servers will be at $8.6 billion. Both of Monday's demonstrations highlight one feature of the Madison chips: They are "pin-compatible" with their Itanium 2 predecessors, meaning that a computer can easily be upgraded with faster chips. It also means that Itanium server designers such as Unisys, HEC, Hitachi, Hewlett-Packard, SGI and IBM don't have to start their server designs from scratch when each new processor arrives. Madison's successor, code-named Montecito, also will be pin-compatible with Itanium 2. Madison largely is the same design as the Itanium 2 but features more high-speed "cache" memory and faster clock speeds. Montecito will be a more dramatic overhaul of the chip circuitry. Intel announced in June that it had passed another Madison milestone, running several operating systems on prototypes of the chip. While Itanium systems are still scarce among customers, they're starting to gain respect. "Given the long gestation and tepid performance of its first generation, we have been resolutely skeptical that the Itanium processor family would achieve its breakout objectives. Itanium 2, however, cracks that skepticism with its stunningly good performance results," Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice said in a recent report. Meanwhile, SGI also plans to trumpet its Itanium systems Monday at the show, detailing the performance of a server with 64 Itanium 2 processors running the Linux operating system. The company plans to begin selling the product early in 2003.
2005-07-19 - Intel's friends pass on Itanium chipset    Intel released the latest upgrade to its Itanium processor, but not all the chipmaker's friends are eager to jump on the bandwagon. As previously reported, Intel is now shipping two versions of its Itanium 2 processor from its 64-bit "Madison" family. The chips run at speeds of 1.66GHz, with computer memory cache sizes of 9MB ($4,655) and 6MB ($2,194). More impressive is the revised front-side bus, which, according to Intel, now transfers data to and from the chip at speeds of 667MHz. The improvement to the chipset sets the stage for the forthcoming dual-core Itanium processor, code-named Montecito, which will feature the same bus architecture. Computer maker Hitachi said it would adopt the new Itanium 2 processors for its BladeSymphony servers, due in the next 30 days. But Intel's other Itanium friends are not as eager to ship computer systems with the new front-side bus. Representatives with Hewlett-Packard, Fujitsu and SGI said they would wait to align their product road maps with the upcoming Montecito processors. "HP uses their own chipset, as does Hitachi, Fujitsu and SGI," said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst with Insight64.com. "Unless you are getting your boxes or motherboards from Intel, odds are the faster bus will be of little interest to you." Smaller regional players such as computer maker Bull and network integrators Unisys, EDS and Accenture are much more likely to adopt the new Itanium processors, Brookwood said. The improved front-side bus bandwidth allows for 10.6 gigabits of data per second to pass from the processor to other system components. In contrast, the current generation 400MHz FSB transfers 6.4 gigabits of data per second. "By stepping up the bus speed, you can feed the processor's voracious appetite for data, and the dual-core processors are going to have an even more voracious appetite," Brookwood said. "Intel typically introduces chips and chipsets on a staggered basis. In the case of Itanium, there have been several products--McKinley, Madison and the second version of Madison--that have all been served by the same chipset. So this marks a real shift for Intel." While sales of Itanium have been off the mark in the past--$1.4 billion in 2004, according to IDC--Intel is still optimistic, since eight of nine RISC vendors and six of seven mainframe vendors sell mainframe-class Itanium-based servers. Intel is expected to approach scientific, oil and gas, and government industries with the new versions of its high-performance chip.
1999-10-06 - Intel's competitors refuse to follow the leader    SAN JOSE, California--Intel is forging ahead with high-end processor plans, although the chip giant is moving in a direction that no one else seems interested in following. While Intel's upcoming Itanium chip, code-named Merced, speaks a brand-new language, IBM, Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, AMD, and other competitors are sticking with the chip architectures they already have. Those Intel competitors laid down the gauntlet yesterday, unveiling high-end chip plans at the Microprocessor Forum here and revealing a wide variety of ways to extend their current chip designs. Intel says those current chip designs are hobbled and don't have room to grow. But Intel's competitors, in sticking with existing designs, offer a huge benefit: They don't require software firms to overhaul their products. (When computer makers adopt a new chip architecture, all software must be reworked to fit the new design.) "We see no need to move to a new architecture," IBM's Jim Kahle said in a talk to hundreds of chip designers at the annual processor industry conference. "Our customers demand architecture stability." Intel acknowledges that many improvements emerged at this week's conference but said its own chips will be able to benefit from many of those design improvements in coming years. With Itanium, Intel is focusing on creating a "better building block" that later can be updated with technologies such as multiple CPUs within a single chip, said Harsh Sharangpani, principal engineer of the Itanium chip. Ironically, the debate resembles one that began years ago when the roles were reversed. Then, Intel stuck with existing "CISC" designs while competitors shifted to new "RISC" designs. To address performance problems, different companies are taking different approaches for chips that are scheduled to arrive in 2001 or later. IBM, with its Power4, is putting two central processing units (CPUs) on a single chip and connecting lots of Power4 chips with super-high-speed data pathways. Compaq's Alpha EV8 chip will use a method called "symmetrical multithreading" that doubles performance with only a minor increase in the size of the chip. And HAL Computer Systems, which makes chips for Fujitsu based on Sun's Sparc designs, said some of the methods Intel is pursuing with its IA-64 chips don't provide much performance benefit. All chips speak a language called an "instruction set," and for years Intel's chips instruction set has been known as "x86." However, with its upcoming Itanium chip--the first in a the family that uses the IA-64 instruction set--Intel is beginning a new era. AMD, meanwhile, still sees a future in the x86 architecture. It's extending the x86 line with its own 64-bit chips, said AMD's Fred Weber, vice president of engineering for AMD's Computation Products Group. HAL's Sparc64 V Mike Shebanow, a designer of HAL's Sparc64 V chip due in 2001, said his company found that a method called "predication" sped up chip operations only about 5 percent. Predication is the process of writing software more efficiently before it's ever processed by the chip, avoiding situations where one calculation in the chip must await the outcome of another before it can be completed. Shebanow, though, said his company has found it's more worthwhile for the chip to spend time on "super-speculation," executing instructions in advance, anticipating that one particular calculation is the right course of action and discarding the results if it's not. Intel's Sharangpani, though, believes that HAL didn't have a complete use of the predication method. "You can't patch these things on and expect the benefit," he said. Compaq's EV8 Compaq's EV8 is due in 2002 and will run at speeds of 1.2 GHz to 2 GHz, said Joel Emer, principle member of Compaq's Alpha design staff. It will be manufactured with on a process capable of making features as small as 0.125 microns and will use two methods--copper interconnects and silicon-on-insultor technology--that increase a chip's speed and decrease its power consumption. The symmetrical multithreading technique adds only 5 percent to the area of the chip, Emer said, while doubling its performance. The method essentially provides a more efficient way to feed a CPU instructions and data, filling up spare moments during which CPU is otherwise idling, Emer said. Emer said symmetrical multithreading of using a CPU more efficiently is less costly than IBM's brute-force method of stuffing multiple CPUs in a single chip. Indeed, Microdesign Resources analyst Keith Diefendorff said IBM's technique does use more silicon. But the symmetrical multithreading method is "more of a research thing"--in other words, a less proven idea. IBM's Power4 IBM thinks its Power4 design is plenty good, too. Big Blue's Power4 will debut in 2001, will run at speeds of at least 1 GHz, will have 170 million transistors, and will use both silicon-on-insulator and copper interconnect technology, Kahle said. The Power4 is a huge chip, with two CPUs connected to a large amount of high-speed memory called cache. Altogether, the package plugs into computers with 5,500 pins to transfer data--roughly 10 times as many as the Itanium. The Power4 has very high internal data transfer speeds, Kahle said. It can move data from the cache to the CPU at speeds of 100 gigabytes per second--fast enough to transfer 20 feature movies in a single second, Kahle said

2009-01-26 - Intel's Barrett leaves chipmaking legacy shortfall Chances are pretty good that once Intel Chairman Craig Barrett formally retires in May, he'll head straight for Montana just as the snows are melting and the rivers are high. The avid fisherman, who served as Intel's fourth chief executive officer until three years ago, seems equally at ease discussing how to create some of the most complex structures known to man and the best way to tie a fly. The company announced Friday that Barrett will step down as chairman of the board of the world's largest chipmaker, three years after turning over the CEO post to current Intel head Paul Otellini. He leaves a mixed legacy behind: under his watch, Intel cemented its reputation as the world's leading chip-manufacturing organization. It operates a network of sophisticated "fabs" around the world that are the envy of the industry and of which Barrett, who is credited for perfecting Intel's approach to chip manufacturing in the 1970s and '80s, is immensely proud. But despite allocating billions of dollars toward R&D and acquisitions, Intel has failed to translate its dominant position atop the PC and server industries into a significant presence in any other market, such as consumer electronics or communications. That could give the company big problems as PCs and servers turn into slow-growing commodities, which is exactly the situation it sought to avoid in attempting to expand its reach. Barrett leaves Intel at a time when the company is in as bad a shape as it has been in a long time, mostly thanks to the state of the worldwide economy. The last time things were this bad at Intel, however, was the time when Barrett made perhaps his most important contribution to the company as CEO. During the dot-com bust years, Intel was very worried about its chip manufacturing plants. Such plants, known as fabs in the industry, are ridiculously expensive to build and maintain, and therefore have to be run at very high capacity to generate a return. With PC demand falling faster than the Nasdaq, there was considerable sentiment both outside and inside Intel that the company should think about pulling back on plans to invest billions in new fabs and new manufacturing technologies. Barrett disagreed, and his was a very important vote. His decision to damn the torpedoes and plunge money in the manufacturing operation left Intel sitting pretty once PC demand recovered, with enough capacity and manufacturing expertise to ensure that PC makers would have to come to Intel for the majority of their chips. While Intel embarked on that strategy, however, it took its eye off its core business in a very important way. A day of reckoning would soon be upon its Netburst architecture, the soul of the Pentium 4 and Xeon processors that made Intel the vast majority of its money. Simply put, Netburst ran too hot. The architecture was designed to allow Intel to crank up the clock speed of its chips to new heights, which the company's marketing people believed was the only metric attached to processor performance that regular people understood. But the faster you run a chip, the more heat it produces. Intel once spoke of taking the Pentium 4 architecture to 10GHz, but concerns about power consumption and heat dissipation ensured the chip would top out under 4GHz. Faced with this reality, Intel was forced to throw together a multicore processing strategy to divide the workload across two cores that ran at slower speeds and consumed less power. Barrett is credited with developing Intel's "copy-exactly" manufacturing strategy and investing billions in new plants. Intel Advanced Micro Devices, which had anticipated this problem earlier than Intel, was able to capitalize on that misstep with its Opteron processors, transforming the company from an enterprise afterthought to a serious supplier of silicon to the Fortune 500. AMD's rise also forced Intel to dramatically scale back its hopes for its Itanium processor, which it once felt would bring the computing world to 64-bit processing but that now occupies a small niche in the high-end server market. Server customers had little interest in rewriting their software to run on Itanium, and preferred AMD's simpler approach that was compatible with existing software. Intel recovered nicely with a series of products based on a more power-friendly architecture and AMD's amazing ability tosnatch defeat from the jaws of victory. It was helped by another key decision started under Barrett's leadership. Barrett moved Intel more into the business of chipset, graphics, and Wi-Fi chip production. PC companies loved the fact that they could now come to Intel for all the chips they needed to build their products, which also allowed them to reduce the amount of money they spent testing and verifying that various third-party components would come together. Centrino was the most visible part of this strategy, a brand that came to represent "wireless notebook" for a good portion of the world. Still, Intel enters 2009 having gained little from its efforts to diversify its business. Under Barrett, Intel has heavily promoted a wide-area wireless networking standard known as WiMax, thought of in its simplest terms as Wi-Fi on steroids. So far, however, the wireless industry has not been as receptive to the idea as Intel had once hoped. Sprint has dithered over its plans for a WiMax network amid troubles of its own, and Intel had to write down $950 million of its investment in Clearwire, a WiMax network provider. Earlier, Intel made a series of acquisitions designed to catapult it into the communications market. It spent billions without generating much of a return, failing to crack the smartphone market and scaling back its interest in the telecommunications industry with the added insult of hundreds of millions in impairment charges. Barrett's greatest legacy, however, may eventually have little to do with technology. He has spent his three years as Intel's chairman circling the globe evangelizing education and investment in scientific research. He has especially urged the U.S. government to improve educational standards in this country, worrying that a lack of interest in science and technology among young students could lead to a decline in U.S. competitiveness in the years to come. Barrett's huge Montana ranch will probably be a fine place to retire and reflect on his 35-year career at one of the world's most important companies. Intel may be in a bust cycle in the famously boom-and-bust semiconductor industry, but a decade ago he correctly identified where Intel needed to go: now all the company has to do is make it happen.
2000-05-10 - Intel woos open-source crowd with chip details Intel has posted the microarchitecture for its upcoming Itanium processor on the Web in an effort to make it easier for open-source programmers to build applications for the new chip. The microarchitecture, which contains technical information on the chip's subsystems, cache structure and other microarchitecture details, typically isn't publicly disclosed before the commercial launch of a chip. Hardware makers and software developers usually have copies but must sign nondisclosure agreements. Intel, however, is shifting its policy to accommodate the changes in the industry wrought by the rise of Linux and the open-source community, said Ron Curry, director of IA-64 marketing. Open-source programming is a communal affair: Developers contribute ideas on a volunteer basis and don't necessarily work at companies covered by the nondisclosure agreements. To ensure that a broad array of applications will be ready and debugged for Itanium's launch in the second half, therefore, Intel is releasing the documents now. In addition, the company is connecting Itanium-based servers to the Web so programmers can test-drive their software. "If we keep everything close to the vest, it is a speed bump in the process," Curry said. "The environment has changed, with the open-source community becoming increasingly important." Linux appears destined to play a substantial role in the acceptance of Itanium, Intel's first 64-bit processor. Itanium will process data in 64-bit chunks, twice the size that current Pentium chips handle. It will compete against processors from Sun Microsystems, IBM and Compaq Computer's Alpha division. The chip, however, has been delayed several times. A number of analysts and computer executives have stated that Itanium will largely be a development platform. General commercial acceptance isn't expected until McKinley, the successor due in late 2001, according to many. During these setbacks, Linux has emerged as a major vehicle for the chip. A version of Linux was one of the first operating systems to successfully run Itanium. Still, the decentralized nature of open-source programming presents a challenge. "The community is much more fractured now, particularly the Linux community," said Mike Feibus, principal analyst at Mercury Research. Intel is not the first company to try to win support by publishing chip designs. Last year, Sun publicly published the designs of some of its embedded processors, such as the PicoJava chip, and even loosened some of the licensing restrictions in an effort to encourage chipmakers to adopt its designs. Many of the salient details about Itanium have already been released and are repeated in the documents posted today. As reported earlier, the chip will initially run at 800 MHz. It will contain three levels of cache. The third level of cache, which acts as a data reservoir, will contain as much as 4MB of memory. Several companies are building servers and workstations for Itanium. Intel has also designed a two-processor workstation and a four-processor server that computer makers can adopt, said Abhi Talwalkar, general manager of the server products division at Intel.
2004-02-12 - Intel wins Intergraph appeal   Intel has won an appeal in a long-standing suit with Intergraph, raising the possibility the chip giant can recover some of the $150 million it has already paid the rival chipmaker to settle the dispute. A federal appeals court on Wednesday vacated a district court verdict in the case that revolves around Intel?s Itanium processor. In the case, the court ruled that Intel's 64-bit Itanium chip infringed on intellectual property developed for Intergraph's now defunct Clipper processor and awarded the company $150 million. Wednesday's ruling calls into question an unusual settlement, whereby Intel agreed to a nonrefundable $150 million payment to Intergraph if a court found that the Itanium infringed on Intergraph's intellectual property, with another $100 million possible if Intel chose to appeal and Intergraph prevailed on appeal. Intergraph also had a separate suit against Intel over its 32-bit processor technology, which it agreed to settle for $300 million as part of the same April 2002 agreement. Under the terms of the settlement in the Itanium case, Intel agreed to pay the $150 million, but reserved the right to appeal the issue of whether infringement occurred. If it lost the appeal, it agreed to pay $100 million more to Intergraph. The terms stipulated that Intel would not receive the $150 million already paid even if it won its appeal. The court did more than just side with Intel, however, finding that no infringement occurred. The appeals court completely vacated the trial court ruling. As a result, it is unclear what happens to the $150 million. "We certainly are grateful that the appeals court agreed with our position," said Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman. "It is premature to speculate on what will happen next. We?ve got a lot of analysis to determine how the ruling affects the framework." Intergraph CEO Halsey Wise said in a statement that the company is still studying the ruling. "The decision is being reviewed by Intergraph's counsel to determine its meaning in the context of the April 4, 2002, settlement agreement between Intergraph and Intel," Wise said. Intergraph also has separate suits against several PC makers that the company says are not affected by the latest ruling. "Today's ruling on the appeal of Intel's infringement of our 'PIC patents' relates to different patents and products than those involved in our ongoing lawsuit with Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and Gateway," Wise said.
2001-04-26 - Intel urges investors to take long view    Business might be down now, but it's going to get better, Intel executives told Wall Street on Thursday. Although the worldwide economic slump has maimed the company's bottom line, some of the economic conditions hurting the semiconductor industry are beginning to abate, said Intel CEO Craig Barrett and other executives at the company's analyst meeting in New York. Spending on capital equipment and research, combined with administrative cost reductions, will also continue. "Investing in new technology is the only way to make yourself stronger coming out of a recession," Barrett said. Increasing capital spending to recover from a recession, Chairman Andy Grove added, could safely be called Moore's second law, named for former Intel CEO Gordon Moore, who formulated the maxim that computer processing power doubles roughly every 18 months. Additionally, the company will release a host of new chips for servers, PCs and portables, including a 2GHz Pentium 4, 1.1GHz notebook chips and Xscale chips for handheld devices. Still, Grove warned that the chip giant has to watch out for sudden shifts. Holding up a series of charts from the 1981 analysts' meeting, Grove showed how Intel's business of providing chips for mainframe terminals had been growing quite well in the 1970s and 1980. Then, in the first quarter of 1981, "net income practically disappeared overnight," he said. At the time, IBM was popularizing the PC with corporations. The rest is history. Asia will also play a huge part in any recovery. Historically, the Americas have been Intel's largest geographic market. In the fourth quarter of 2000, however, greater Asia, which combines Asia-Pacific with Japan, accounted for more revenue because of accelerating growth in China and India, said Mike Splinter, executive vice president for marketing and sales. Overall, more than 60 percent of Intel's revenue comes from overseas. "Even as growth resumes in our (American) business, I expected this trend to continue," Splinter said. Eventually, "Asia-Pacific will be our largest region." The region also will continue to grow in importance as a manufacturing arm. For years, major U.S. PC manufacturers have outsourced desktop and notebook manufacturing to Asia. Increasingly, cell phone manufacturers are turning to Asia, and Intel is currently locking up deals with local companies such as China's Legend to use Intel processors. A total of 26 Asian contract manufacturers just agreed to endorse Intel's Personal Internet Client Architecture (PICA), a blueprint for cell phones and handheld computers. "We have long-standing relationships with these companies," Splinter said. As far as product segments go, inventories of PC chips have begun to fall, said executives, although there are still large inventories of communications chips and flash memory, which will retard sales of those products. Looking long term, all of the executives maintained companies will continue to invest in communications and computing infrastructure. As for products, Intel provided some new details of upcoming chips but largely reiterated plans the company has shared at other events. A 2GHz Pentium 4 for desktops will come out in the third quarter, said Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel Architecture Group. Speeds will also continue to escalate, now that the new chip design has hit the market. "Over its life, it (the Pentium 4) will scale above 10GHz," he said. "In the past year, you have seen Intel struggling, quite frankly, to get the next hundred megahertz out of the Pentium III." Higher speeds, lower prices While speed will go up, costs will decline. Smaller, less costly versions of the Pentium 4 made with the 0.13-micron manufacturing process will come out in the fourth quarter. In addition, smaller computer chassis coming in the second quarter will reduce costs. Currently, the base cost of materials for the cheapest PCs, minus processor and memory, is $175. That will drop to between $150 and $125, Otellini predicted. Prices on Rambus memory will also go down, and a chipset called the 845 will allow PC makers to marry Pentium 4s to regular, less-expensive memory toward the end of the year. Recent price cuts and continued collaboration with hardware makers and software developers will also help proliferate the chip. Already, Pentium 4 computers can be found for less than $1,000 in the United States, he said. For notebooks, Pentium IIIs running at 1.1GHz and faster made on the 0.13-micron process will come out in the third quarter, along with chips for the subnotebook market running at more than 700MHz. In subnotebooks, Intel chips will offer chips running at "twice the performance and less than half the power consumed" relative to competing chips from Transmeta, Otellini added. Meanwhile, Itanium processors for servers will come out this quarter. "This is the quarter many of us have waited five or six years for," he said. As previously reported, the successor to the first Itanium, called McKinley, will appear in pilot projects at the end of the year. The chip will contain 240 million transistors and run at speeds of 1GHz or higher. In handheld devices, Intel will continue to pursue contracts with cell phone and handheld-computer manufacturers while also working with application developers to create new software for Internet-enabled cell phones. The first Xscale chips, the successor to the StrongARM family, will come out in the second half. "We will enable parallel development of the communications technology, the computing technology and the applications that run on top of it," said Ron Smith, general manager of the Wireless Communications and Computing Group. "This unlocks the so-called wireless Internet to the PC application developers." Palm also has endorsed Intel's chips, he said. While showing a slide of software companies that have adopted StrongARM, Smith told analysts, "We could even add Palm to this list because they have already announced that they will (support) our StrongARM and Xscale processors." A deal to get Intel chips inside Palm devices has been in the works since last year, according to sources. Every product-division head at Intel made a presentation except for John Miner, who heads up the New Business Group, which oversees Intel Online services and other efforts. Several projects in this group were canceled last year. Miner took over the group earlier this year.
2020-12-03 - Intel upgrades quantum computer ambitions with new control chip    Intel unveiled on Thursday its Horse Ridge 2 processor for controlling quantum computers, an important milestone in making the potentially revolutionary machines practical.The Horse Ridge 2 isn't a quantum processor itself but is designed to solve the challenges of communicating with future quantum processors with thousands or more qubits. The processor is the second generation of a family that debuted in 2019.The processor comes as Intel endeavors to catch up with quantum computer rivals like IBM and Google. The chipmaker hopes it eventually will leapfrog the competition with processors housing vastly more qubits, the data processing element fundamental to quantum computers, than its competitors have. Horse Ridge 2 moves Intel closer to that goal by making Intel's large-qubit-count designs more workable.Making quantum computers practical is key to transforming the expensive machines into technology that can tackle problems out of reach of conventional computers. Proponents expect the machines to help spur breakthroughs in materials science, finance and logistics when they become more readily available and affordable.Qubits can store data in multiple states at once, in contrast to the zeroes or 1s of classical computers, and can perform new types of computing through a quantum physics phenomenon called entanglement that links multiple qubits.Many of today's quantum computers, house their quantum processors in an extraordinarily cold chamber just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. The cold is necessary to shield finicky qubits from outside influences. Relatively hot conventional computers communicate with qubits via cables that traverse colder and colder stages of refrigeration. Into the quantum realm Google's quantum supremacy is only a first taste of a computing revolutionHoneywell fires up the H1, its second-generation quantum computerIBM doubles its quantum computer performanceIntel's Horse Ridge chips, named after the coldest place in Oregon, are designed to move the control process nearer to the quantum chips without perturbing their operations. Doing so will cut back on the number of gleaming communication cables that link the coddled qubits with the rougher outside world. Those cables are acceptable for today's quantum computers with dozens of qubits. They grow impractical, however, with qubit counts that are expected to reach the thousands, then likely millions."If you have the world's best quantum processor but not a way to control it, you can't do anything with it," said Jim Clarke, leader of Intel's quantum computing hardware program. Clarke led an online tour of Intel's quantum work at the Oregon lab where it developed and announced Horse Ridge 2.Quantum computer brainsThe quantum computing spotlight shines most brightly on quantum processors and the qubits they house. Among those working on various forms of quantum processors are Google, IBM, Rigetti Computing, IonQ, Honeywell, Microsoft, Intel and PsiQuantum. If quantum processors are the brains of the operation, Horse Ridge 2 is more like the spinal cord that provides an essential link to the outside world.Key to Horse Ridge is the ability to run at very cold temperatures so it can be housed as close as possible to the quantum processor, Clarke said. Horse Ridge 2 adds an ability to retrieve data from qubits after they're done processing, not just tell them what to do.Clarke also touted automated testing technology Intel expects will speed quantum computing progress. It cuts the assessment time of silicon wafers of quantum processors from weeks to 4 or 5 hours.Intel hopes its spin qubit chips, which can be made on the same processes as it uses for conventional computer chips, will give it a come-from-behind victory over today's quantum computing leaders. Spin qubits use individual electrons as qubits, manipulating them with magnetic fields and storing data through a quantum mechanical state of the electron called spin."A spin qubit is a million times smaller than a superconducting qubit," Clarke said. "We recognize we don't have the same qubit count as others, but we feel this is a technology that's going to scale better."
2004-11-09 - Intel updates Itanium 2 line   Intel on Monday updated its Itanium 2 processors, adding a top-end model to a high-end family designed to displace chips from Sun Microsystems and IBM. As expected, Intel announced a new Itanium 2 with 9MB of high-speed cache memory. The processor runs at 1.6GHz and costs $4,226 per chip in batches of 1,000, the company said. Also on Monday, Hewlett-Packard and Unisys introduced servers that employ the new processor. As part of the revamp, Intel released a $530 low-voltage model that doesn't consume as much power or produce as much waste heat as the top-end models. The low-voltage chip is faster than its predecessor, running at 1.3GHz and including 3MB of cache, compared with 1GHz and 1.5GB of cache. The Itanium line, which began as an HP research project before Intel took it over in the 1990s, has been a trying product for the chipmaker. It was delayed several times and now is only positioned as an alternative to high-end competitors, in contrast to Intel's Xeon, which is built and sold in vastly higher quantities. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel said in September that Itanium had failed to meet one of its 2004 goals, which was to double the number of processors shipped from the more than 100,000 of 2003. But there are some bright spots. Itanium has succeeded in extending Intel's reach to a more rarefied market, where servers have dozens of processors such as Sun's UltraSparc IV and IBM's Power5, prices extend beyond $1 million, and customers are demanding. Abhi Talwalkar, vice president and general manager of the Enterprise Platforms Group at Intel, said the chip family has met a different goal for 2004: Being used in mission-critical systems for more than 40 of the world's 100 largest corporations. A successor called Montecito is due to enter production in the fourth quarter of 2005, though high-volume manufacturing won't begin until early 2006, Talwalkar said. Montecito has dual-processing engines on each slice of silicon (a design called "dual-core"), and each core can execute two instruction sequences (called "threads"). Montecito will drop into existing Itanium 2 server designs. The chip, though larger, still fits within the 130-watt power envelope of the family, Talwalkar said. A change planned to debut with Montecito's successor, Tukwila, is an interface called the Common Platform Architecture, or CPA. That interface will also be used for Xeon-based computers, which should lower system-design barriers and Itanium costs, if all goes according to plan.
2000-02-07 - Intel Upcoming Itanium chip will hit 800 MHz   SAN FRANCISCO--Intel confirmed today that its next-generation, high-end processor will come out at 800 MHz when it debuts later this year. The processor, which has experienced some delays, is the 64-bit Itanium chip. It's Intel's first foray into a high-end market largely defined by such companies as Sun Microsystems and IBM. Intel is currently shipping prototype Itanium chips to computer makers for testing, analysts have said. Although 800 MHz will make the new 64-bit chip slower than Pentium IIIs when it comes out, there are a number of performance benefits for this chip, Intel executives said at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference here. "Eight-hundred MHz will be our speed at production; however, this is just the beginning," said Gadi Singer, one of the head researchers on the Itanium project. "The 800-MHz (chip) is being developed on a relatively new process and the architecture is not tuned yet for critical speed paths." Among other benefits: A four-processor Itanium server using a standard Intel chipset will be able to handle 64 gigabytes of memory, far more than traditional Intel server systems, Singer said. He also said that the system bus used with the chip will perform 266 million transfers per second--roughly equal to 266-MHz--which is double the current bus rate. The chip will execute six instructions per clock cycle, double the Pentium III in most circumstances. Itanium will initially come in two basic varieties, depending on cache size. The less-expensive chips will come with 2MB of third-level cache, a memory reservoir near the processor that boosts performance. More expensive versions will come with 4MB of third-level cache. The software that comes with that processor will also come with "memory hints" that will tell the cache whether to discard data or retain it for repeat use. Itanium will be paired with standard computer memory, called SDRAM, and in all likelihood a newer, faster version of SDRAM called DDR DRAM. The chip will come in one- and two-processor workstations and in servers going from one to 512 processors, Singer said. "Today we have four percent of the server capacity that will be needed in four to five years. That leaves 96 percent," he said. In other news, Intel sources said that the first 1-GHz Pentium III will come out around midyear, with computers using the chips arriving at the same time. AMD, IBM, and Compaq's Alpha unit are also describing plans for 1-GHz chips at the conference, which should appear at the same time. The bigger issue Itanium faces is how much demand there will be for it. Generally, analysts believe that its number-crunching prowess will  make it good for workstations and technical computing, especially the lofty  edge of the workstation market that Intel has yet to fully penetrate.  Typically conservative business users, however, will mostly likely initially  purchase Itanium systems for testing purposes before moving widely to the  new chip.
2001-08-23 - Intel unveils Linux programming tools  Intel, one of the first mainstream companies to endorse the Linux operating system, announced programming tools Thursday to make Linux programs run better on its chips. In a statement, the chipmaker announced compilers that translate Linux programs written in C++ or Fortran languages into commands an Intel Pentium 4 or Itanium chip can understand. Compilers are key to making sure programs can take advantage of a chip's new features, such as those that distinguish the Pentium 4 from its predecessors, but the design of the Itanium family relies even more heavily than most chips on the performance of the compiler. The compilers will include several features already incorporated in Intel's compilers for Windows computers, including support for the OpenMP standard for multiprocessor computers, the chipmaker said. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel has been a backer of Linux, a clone of Unix that's grown popular for use in servers--chiefly those based on Intel chips. Releasing compilers helps write programs that show off Intel's chips to their greatest advantage. However, the standard compiler most Linux programmers use is GCC, recently upgraded to version 3.0. Scientific programmers, the chief users of the Fortran language and people who often write their own software, are often interested in squeezing every bit of performance possible out of a chip. Each Linux compiler is expected to be released in September as a $399 download or $499 CD on sale at Intel's software site. Meanwhile, programming toolmaker Borland released in July its own compiler as part of its Delphi package. The Delphi compiler, while part of a $1,999 package in a high-end configuration, is available for free in the Open Edition for use in creating open-source software covered by the General Public License (GPL).
2004-06-28 - Intel unveils its 3264-bit chips   Intel's first chip that runs 32-bit and 64-bit software debuted in workstations on Monday, with the company promising a server version will arrive in two months. The new Xeon processor, formerly code-named Nocona, runs at speeds of 3.6GHz and lower and comes out with a complementary chipset called the E7525. It can handle both 32-bit software, found on most PCs and small Linux servers, and 64-bit software such as complex database programs. The first version of the 32/64-bit Xeon is designed for dual-processor workstations. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and other computer makers have announced boxes that integrate the chip. These range in price from $850 to $1,800, depending on the configuration. A server version will come out within 60 days, said Abhi Talwalkar, the general manager of the Enterprise Platform Group at Intel. 32/64-bit chips that can be used to build servers with four or more processors will come out in late 2004 or early 2005, he added. Despite this, SuperMicro and other smaller PC makers have already introduced servers with the 32/64-bit Xeon. In addition, some companies, such as digital editing software maker Avid Technology, have announced they have tweaked their 32-bit Intel products to run in 64-bit mode. Most current Intel and AMD chips can run only 32-bit software, which means they digest data in 32-bit chunks. One of the chief limitations of these chips is that they pull data from just 4GB of memory. That's not a problem in desktops--high-end machines come with only 1GB and likely won't feature 4GB for a few years--but server makers have been complaining about the memory ceiling. Last year, AMD released Opteron, the first 32/64-bit chip based on the popular x86 architecture. It has been adopted by IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems. Until Opteron, few large computer makers had ever incorporated AMD chips into their corporate machines. Overall, Nocona workstations provide a roughly 30 percent improvement in performance over existing Xeons in 32-bit mode, Talwalkar said. The 64-bit capability should increase those benefits, he added. While the 32/64-bit functionality of the new Xeon is likely to make the most impact in workstations and servers, the chip will enable other new features. PCI Express, for instance, will link the processor to the rest of a computer using high-speed links, and the system will also be capable of using DDR 2 memory. By 2005, the vast majority of Intel's server and workstation chips will be capable of processing 64-bit software, Talwalkar said. However, computer manufacturers will only gradually begin to use the processors in this fashion. Pat Patla, the director of workstation and server marketing for AMD, said that while Intel has been able to bake in 32/64-bit processing, it has not matched many of AMD's chip architecture enhancements. AMD's Opteron has an integrated memory controller, which speeds up performance, he said. In addition, the HyperTransport links featured in Opteron shuttle data faster than the PCI Express connections in the Xeon and are used more extensively in the processor, he said. Opteron also consumes far less energy, Patla said. Still, he conceded that Opteron cannot accommodate DDR 2 memory yet. Now that the Xeon is released, the industry will be able to judge whether it is likely to cannibalize sales of Itanium, a 64-bit chip from Intel that runs different software. Intel maintains that the new chip won't. Itanium provides superior performance for 64-bit work overall, and it will be in demand for the most complex computing jobs, the chipmaker said. The 32/64-bit Xeon is compatible with existing software, however, which could prove to be a big selling point. Marc West, the chief information officer at games developer Electronic Arts who took part in a conference call for Intel, said that the chip gives the company a way to ease into 64-bit computing. By contrast, he called Itanium an "all or nothing" proposition. "With the new structure, we are looking at a way of easing into it," West said. But G-Trade Services, the online trading division of The Bank of New York, said on the that call it had adopted Itanium last year to run a Java-based transaction application and will likely keep using it. "Java is a memory pig," Joe Weisbord, the chief technology officer at G-Trade, said. "We kept hitting the 32-bit max." Ivan Tay, the director of product management at SuperMicro, said that the new Xeon will allow customers to get to 64-bit computing for less. "Itanium 2 is just too expensive," he said. "In the past, Opteron was gaining momentum. Last year, people started maxing out on the 4GB limit." The 3.6GHz version of the 32/64-bit Xeon is priced at $851 in quantities of 1,000 and is available in limited quantities only. Under the same terms the different versions sell at the following prices: 3.4GHz for $690; 3.2GHz for $455; 3GHz for $316 and 2.8GHz for $209. The E7525 chipset sells for $100.
2003-09-08 - Intel unveils budget Itaniums  Intel on Monday released a pair of Itanium 2 processors designed for rack-mounted servers and clusters as it attempts to expand the chip family's reach. The Low Voltage Itanium 2, formerly code-named Deerfield, and a scaled-down version of the latest Itanium 2 chip are largely designed to fit inside two-processor servers where cost, space and energy consumption are paramount concerns. All three factors are important in clusters, which can consist of a few thousand computers strung together for mainframe-class tasks, or in relatively low-cost servers dedicated to a few specific tasks, such as handling authentication for a large Web site. "There have been two-processor (Itanium) systems out there, but this allows us to be more effective from a low-power and cost perspective," said Jason Waxman, director of multiplatform marketing at Intel. Dell announced it will insert the new chips into its PowerEdge 3250 server for high-performance clusters, while Hewlett-Packard said it will add the Low Voltage Itanium 2 into a workstation. Technically, the processor core--the computing brain inside the silicon--of both chips is identical to the core on the 1.5GHz Itanium 2 chip. That chip, formerly code-named Madison, was released in June. Intel, though, has varied the speed and cache size so the two new chips will better fit certain applications, Waxman said. The Low Voltage Itanium 2 runs at 1GHz and comes with a 1.5MB cache, which is a reservoir of memory integrated into the processor for rapid data access. Because it runs slower, the Low Voltage chip consumes about half the energy of the high-end Madison processor and features a maximum energy consumption ceiling of 62 watts. Lower energy consumption translates to lower heat dissipation, which allows engineers to stick the chip into smaller servers and/or cram more servers into a single computing room. The other new Itanium 2 runs at 1.4GHz and comes with a 1.5MB cache. Although that's close to the speed of the Madison Itanium 2 chips released in June, those earlier chips come with 3MB, 4MB and 6MB of cache. Typically, high-performance computing clusters want chips with high clock speeds, measured by gigahertz, but don't necessarily need humongous caches, Waxman said. The new models also cost far less. In quantities of 1,000, the 1.4GHz Itanium 2 sells for $1,172 and the low-voltage chip for $744. By contrast, the 1.5 GHz chips released in June that come with 6MB of cache sell for $4,227. Why the price difference? Making chips is like baking cookies. Although the recipe is identical, they don't always come out the same Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. way. In the case of chips, not every one on a wafer will come out with a fully functional 6MB cache or perform at 1.5GHz.Those chips that don't meet the optimal requirements can be legitimately sold as 1.4GHz chips with a 1.5MB cache. These chips aren't defective (i.e., they work as described) and every chip maker engages in this practice as a way to cut costs and improve manufacturing yields. Intel is hoping that the new chips will allow the Itanium family to spread toward the volume segments of the server market. While the current Itanium 2 chips rank with the fastest microprocessors in the world, Intel is still overcoming a history of delays, customer indifference and a lack of software for the Itanium family. Right now, Itanium chips barely contribute to Intel's revenue. Meanwhile, Intel chips based on the x86 architecture, such as the Pentium 4 and the Xeon chip, account for more than 90 percent of computer microprocessors--in servers, notebooks, desktops and workstations--sold. Nonetheless, interest in Itanium is growing, Waxman said. Several applications are coming to market and a number of customers are expressing interest in using Itanium servers to run databases. More than 40 different two- and four-processor servers and 10 servers with eight or more processors based on Itanium will hit the market this year, according to Intel. Dell began to sell Itanium servers again with the release of Madison, after declining to use its most recent predecessor. This year, rival Advanced Micro Devices has also begun to more actively challenge Intel in the server market with Opteron. The new Intel chips, which were expected, are being unveiled a week before the Intel Developer Forum, a three-day convention about all things Intel to be held in San Jose, Calif. At the show, the company is expected to discuss Tanglewood, a version of the Itanium chip planned for 2006 or 2007 that will contain up to 16 different processing cores.
2002-03-25 - Intel unrolls Blueprints program   Intel has sketched out a way for businesses to get complex technology installations up and running faster--and maybe drum up a little business for itself. The chipmaker, under a program it calls Solutions Blueprints, is offering corporations a series of designs for systems intended to perform jobs such as managing finances or employee communications. The plans draw on software applications that run on Intel-based servers from a variety of companies. The Blueprints program arises from an effort by Intel's Enterprise Solutions Division to create products geared toward industries such as telecommunications. Last May, for example, the company launched a line of telecom servers for PC makers and telecommunications-equipment companies, which in turn can add their own operating system and application software and then resell the machines to customers. IBM, for instance, is coming out with a telecom server this week based on the Intel blueprints. Intel has increasingly been taking over more computer design functions for cash-strapped PC makers. It even sells a number of "building block" servers--that is, near-complete servers to which computer maker needs to add only two or three parts. Now an expanded version of the industry-specific effort is ready for prime time, the company says, as some of the world's largest companies move to use server software for challenges ranging from financial accounting to data management. By working with those companies and a variety of hardware makers, software makers and systems integrators, Intel says it has proven the worth of certain hardware and software bundles, or blueprints, that should eliminate much of the grunt work needed to deploy and test such programs. One such project was the creation of a corporate portal, or internal Web site, for a large airline. Intel worked with Cap Gemini, Ernst & Young and Plumtree Software to create the site, which hosts corporate news and human resources, payroll and stock-option information. The project was a "big aha!" for Intel, said Deborah Conrad, vice president and general manager of the chipmaker's Solutions Market Development Group, as companies realized that the completed project laid the groundwork for similar setups elsewhere. Intel estimates that up to 80 percent of a given blueprint can be repeated across multiple installations at a variety of corporations. Repeating such a large chunk of a project's design helps to reduce the cost and time of getting it off the ground, and the project becomes easier to customize in certain areas because most of the work to create the underlying building blocks, including the software, servers and other elements, has already been done. Intel posted several other blueprints on a new Web site Monday, with designs focusing on tracking and storing documents created by company employees and processing financial transactions more quickly. A company's chief technology officer could download a blueprint, contact the companies, and contract with them to set up a similar system, Conrad said. "A lot of the solutions we're describing here are kind of high-end," she said. "But over time, our goal is to make it easer and faster for these solutions to come to market. Over time, they will waterfall down to smaller-size companies." Intel is working with a wide range of companies to bring together and test the blueprints. It will also take advantage of its own facilities as well as those of its partners, including a relatively new Solution Center it built with Hewlett-Packard in Grenoble, France. The center has been charged with testing blueprints for the telecommunications market before releasing them. For some of the telecom blueprints, HP will be the integrator or consultant. A boost for Intel's chips The blueprints are free, but companies still have to buy the software and servers. The new program won't change how Intel sells its chips or other hardware, but it does tie into the revamping of the company's server strategy, designed to deliver new Xeon and Itanium processors that compete more closely with products from rivals such as Sun Microsystems. At the same time, it benefits the company by ensuring that the software required to put projects such as corporate portals into use runs well on its server chips. "Our goal is to make sure that all of the pieces of the puzzle work best on Intel architecture," Conrad said. "Our No. 2 goal is to make sure that solution is...priced competitively versus our competitors." If the software works well with Intel's chips, the theory goes, then companies will continue to buy Intel-based servers. Server chips are some of the company's highest-priced offerings, so it's important, analysts say, for Intel to promote them. "These are high-priced chips, but their (sales) volume is quite low," said Dean McCarron, principal at Mercury Research. "There's a lot of incentive for Intel to help fuel the market for server products." By some accounts, the company's new 64-bit chips have gotten off to a slow start. The Blueprints program will cover current and future versions of the 64-bit Itanium, the next version of which, the 1GHz McKinley, is due later this year. "I don't think there's any understating how important it is for Intel to get the IA-64 server market going along," McCarron said. Many of the blueprint machines include Intel's newest processors, announced over the past few months, including the 2.2GHz, dual-processor "Prestonia" Xeon, the multiprocessor Xeon MP and a new dual-processor Pentium III aimed at blade servers. Intel will offer blueprints for about 10 different industries to start. They include digital media, energy, financial services, government, manufacturing, oil and energy, packaged goods, retail sales, and telecommunications. The company will kick off the Blueprints program with nearly 30 partners, including Cap Gemini, Compaq Computer, Deloitte Consulting, Dimension Data, EDS, Fujitsu-Siemens, HP, Microsoft, Plumtree, Plural, PWC Consulting, Questra, Scient, Siemens Business Services, Silverline, SpeechWorks, Stellcom, Triaton and Xcelerate.
2005-07-08 - Intel tweaks Pentium D for servers Intel is gearing up to debut its first ever dual-core processor for servers, and CNET News.com has learned it's a Pentium. The chipmaking giant is expected to announce next week that its Pentium D can now be sold with a new chipset--the Intel E7230--that has features best suited for entry-level servers. Code-named Mukilteo, the chipset is the follow-on to Intel's Copper River, which is commonly used in workstations. The E7230 comes with the ability to handle 64-bit operating systems such as the Windows XP x64 Edition from Microsoft, advanced dynamic computer memory, faster data transfers via PCI Express and software that emulates storage through the redundant array of independent disks (more commonly known as RAID). The chipsets will sell for $36 apiece when PC makers buy more than 1,000 of them. Pentium D chips retail for $530, $316, $241 in speeds of 3.2GHz, 3GHz and 2.8GHz respectively. Server manufacturers such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard are expected to sell the new Pentium D servers to run simple network server applications such as a Web server or a small database. Intel has outfitted its desktop warrior Pentium for servers before. Some businesses report having Pentium II and Pentium III machines, but these are still single-core processors. A dual-core chip means there are two processor cores in one piece of silicon. The effect is a computer brain that can handle multiple operations at once. Intel, IBM and Advanced Micro Devices are all transitioning their product lines from single-core chips to dual-core ones. Intel has 15 dual-core projects under way. However, the company has only two dual-core processors on the market: its Pentium Extreme Edition and the Pentium D. Intel's traditional server processors are not expected to make a transition to dual core for at least a few more months. Dual-core Itanium server chips are not due to arrive until later this year, and Intel's dual-core Xeon processors are not expected until the first quarter of 2006, company executives have said.
2002-09-04 - Intel to unveil nanotechnology plans   Sunlin Chou, senior vice president of the technology and manufacturing group at Intel, will discuss the company's plans for nanotechnology, or the science of making chips with elements that measure less than 100 nanometers, next Thursday morning at the Intel Developer Forum in San Jose, California. Current chips have features measuring 130 nanometers on average. Chou will review some of Intel's previously announced strategies for nanotechnology manufacturing, but he'll also touch on as-yet-unannounced plans in this area, according to company representatives. And right now, there are two major blank spots when it comes to Intel's nano plans: multigate transistors and carbon nanotubes. Multigate transistors are an answer to the problems created by the shrinking size of components on a chip. Chips increasingly need greater amounts of electricity flowing through their transistors to hit their performance targets. However, transistor gates, which control the flow of electricity across transistors, measure only a few atoms thick and are getting thinner. The mismatch is akin to hooking up a fire hose to a Waterpik nozzle. Increasing the number of gates on a transistor relieves pressure by creating more electrical conduits. IBM has already disclosed plans for double-gate transistors that will begin to appear in 2006. "The double gate was developed in order to improve drive current," said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64. "While I don't think (Intel) will follow double gate, I do think they have a solution that has some similarities to it." Carbon nanotubes, meanwhile, rewrite the basic structure of chips. With these, chipmakers would make circuits out of strings of carbon atoms rather than out of metallic wires. These carbon circuits would pave the way for smaller, faster and cheaper chips. "It gives you the ability to conduct electricity as we can today but with smaller conductors," said Peter Glaskowsky, editor in chief of the Microprocessor Report. "The first guy to figure out how to make these consistently will be a billionaire." Factories would also radically change. With current chipmaking methods, each transistor has to be precisely laid down through lithography, a time-consuming process that costs billions of dollars. By contrast, carbon circuits will form themselves, with the process being controlled through the laws of physics and chemistry. Chips with carbon nanotubes, however, are still years away away. Intel representatives declined to comment on unannounced research efforts but stated that the company would announce new nanotechnology projects, and added that the company has research under way in all of the major areas of development. "We have our announced development approach and our unannounced development approach," said Frank Spindler, vice president in Intel's corporate technology group. "Our position gives us the potential to evaluate all of the options." Loose lips sink chips To date, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip giant has largely been a skeptic when it comes to carbon nanotubes and many other futuristic chip technologies, but that fits a pattern. Intel often publicly questions the need or urgency for new technologies while quietly integrating them into future chips. When IBM first released silicon-on-insulator technology, an additional layer of material below the transistors which allows them to run cooler and faster, Intel said that SOI provided little benefit. Years later, the company said it would incorporate its own version of SOI into chips. Similarly, some Intel executives in 2001 questioned the need or functionality of strained silicon, a method of improving chip performance by spacing silicon atoms farther apart. In August, the company said strained silicon would be incorporated into "Prescott," the code name of the successor to the Pentium 4, due next year. As space age as it sounds, the nanotechnology era will actually begin in the second half of next year, when semiconductor companies begin to release their first chips made on the 90-nanometer process. Intel's first major foray into commercial nanotechnology manufacturing will be Prescott, which will be made on the 90-nanometer process and feature strained silicon. Subsequently, the decade will see the emergence of new types of packaging that will solve the problem of channeling substantial amounts of power into small chips, the use of optical technology inside computers and the emergence of extreme ultraviolet lithography, which uses light with a smaller wavelength to draw circuits. Chips with multiple cores, a design technique that both conserves energy and boosts performance, will also emerge. Also on the bill... The four-day conference will feature a number of other announcements. Intel will provide updates on Madison, the successor to the Itanium II chip, due in the second half of 2003, and Banias, a new mobile chip coming in the first quarter. Both chips have been produced in samples. Banias is expected to come out at speeds hitting up to 1.6GHz. Intel will also give details about the upcoming 3GHz Pentium 4. Hyperthreading, a technology available in Intel's server chips, will be available "very soon," according to a source at Intel. The circuitry for enabling hyperthreading is already incorporated in the Pentium 4 but is not activated. The chip giant will discuss enhancements to its XScale chip, which is found inside handhelds and networking equipment. The improvements are geared toward better wireless use. A final, proposed specification for Serial ATA II will come out. Serial ATA connects hard drives to the rest of the computer.
2000-06-27 - Intel to spend 100 million on assistance program   NEW YORK--In the next year, Intel will spend more than $100 million on a new program to lend its business partners a helping hand gaining entry to markets Intel hopes to penetrate. The program, announced at the PC Expo show here today, will focus on helping Intel customers such as Dell Computer or Compaq Computer tune their Intel-based servers so they can win a place against competing server designs, said Will Swope, general manager of the newly formed Intel solutions enabling group that's in charge of the program. Though Intel will charge those partners $50,000 apiece for the privilege of receiving Intel's expertise, Swope says the program's purpose isn't to garner Intel more revenue, but rather to further the adoption of Intel hardware in the long run. The fee merely covers the costs of the program, he said, which will involve thousands of Intel employees. The program is part of Intel's increasingly aggressive push to steal away market share from higher-powered servers, typically running variants of Unix atop RISC chips Intel hopes to supplant. Intel's years-long strategy is to extend its dominance on desktop computers into ever more expensive, complex, powerful and profitable machines. The strategy marks a more active engagement between Intel and the computer makers that buy its chips. Intel hopes essentially to tow its customers into new markets, helping them by designing Intel hardware that can get the job done. The program is beginning with servers, but will expand to other Intel products later, Intel said. Intel is in a sense taking a page from the Unix-RISC marketing manual, where tight integration between chipmaker and computer manufacturer often is inevitable. In the case of IBM, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, SGI and especially Sun Microsystems, a single company designs the chip, the computer and the fundamental software known as the operating system. Intel's Itanium chip, due later this year and the first 64-bit CPU in Intel's "IA-64" family, is the spearhead of Intel's push to dethrone the more powerful Unix-RISC servers. Intel also has high hopes for future computers with eight more Intel CPUs. "As we roll out IA-64 and new and improved eight-way servers, we know we have applications that will work stunningly better," Swope said. In addition, Intel today announced an expansion of its existing program to let customers visit centers where they can translate their software to Intel hardware. The centers also help value-added resellers (VARs)--companies that typically sell hardware with their own specialized software to a particular market, Swope said. VARs often have a difficult time, for example, testing their software designed for a network with 50 PCs to work on a network with 200, he said. "We're making sure that applications can be tuned and delivered on Intel servers," Swope said.
2000-08-21 - Intel to share Pentium 4 details at forum  Intel will fill in the details on the Pentium 4 at its developer forum in San Jose, Calif., this week and will show off new chips for cell phones and handheld computers. The Pentium 4 will feature a completely new architecture called "NetBurst" designed to handle tasks--such as data encryption, video compression or Napster-like peer-to-peer networking--that have grown in popularity with the Internet, said Albert Yu, senior vice president of the Intel Architecture Group. "It will be the highest-performing processor for PCs," Yu said. "We're moving into streaming video; speech has become much more commonplace than a year ago. Peer-to-peer has been around for a long time, but it is now being recognized as the computing paradigm of the future." New subsystems inside the NetBurst architecture will enable the processor to churn more data at a faster rate, Yu said. A micro-engine called the "Rapid Execution Engine," for example, will run at twice the speed of the processor and will handle frequently repeated tasks, such as addition and subtraction calculations. In a preview of the chip at the company's headquarters, technicians showed how a Pentium 4 computer can rapidly render, or draw, 3D images downloaded from the Internet. That sort of processing power could make it easy for sellers on eBay to post virtual representations of their products, for example. The chip, which will debut at 1.4 GHz and arrive in the fourth quarter, represents the first complete architectural overhaul of the company's processor line since 1995, when the Pentium Pro emerged. It will contain 42 million transistors, compared with 28 million for the Pentium III. In the real world, the architectural changes will lead to better performance for multimedia applications, according to analysts, but incremental improvement with standard desktop applications such as word processing. "A 1.5-GHz Pentium 4 will be 50 percent faster than a 1-GHz Pentium III, but at the system level the performance (improvement) will be much closer to 20 percent than 50 percent," said Peter Glaskowsky, an analyst with MicroDesign Resources. "In the short term, there is going to be an incremental improvement, but the big news here is that the P4 is going to give Intel a lot of headroom in the future, not just for the fall but for 2002 and beyond," said Linley Gwennap, principal at the Linley Group. For Intel, the chip's arrival couldn't come sooner. Manufacturing missteps and increased competition from Advanced Micro Devices have eroded the chip giant's once-unassailable dominance in the market for processors for performance PCs. The tit-for-tat battle between the two will continue, said Glaskowsky, and vary by application. "The new design of the P4 will let the P4 stay ahead of Athlon in terms of clock speed, but also in terms of performance," especially on some multimedia software, he said. Nonetheless, "If AMD can catch up with the P4 in terms of clock speed, a 1.5-GHz Athlon will definitely be faster than a Pentium 4 at 1.5-GHz" on a number of applications, he added. Yu and CEO Craig Barrett will be the first keynote speakers at the Intel Developer Forum, a three-day event that begins Tuesday in San Jose. The event largely serves as a forum for Intel and its associated developers to unfurl their road map for future technology. Along with the Pentium 4, the company will provide updates on Itanium, the long-awaited 64-bit chip for servers. While the Pentium 4 and Itanium will be targeted toward the performance end of the spectrum, the company will also emphasize the device market. On Wednesday, Ron Smith, general manager of Intel's wireless computing group, will announce a new line of StrongArm chips--small, energy-efficient chips for handhelds and cell phones. Formerly code-named StrongArm 2, the new chips will come out at the end of the year. "We are going to be introducing a variant of the StrongArm under a new brand name," the spokesman said. One of the first customers for the chip may be Palm. The handheld computer leader has already said it plans to adopt processors based on the ARM architecture, a processor design licensed by England's ARM. StrongArm chips remain one of the most popular versions of the ARM design. Palm prototypes containing 200-MHz StrongArm chips were shown off at technology events earlier this year. Still, the details surrounding the Pentium 4 will likely be the highlight of the conference. Since last October, chip shortages, combined with AMD's success with Athlon, have put the company on the defensive in the high end of the market. Though analysts have expressed varying opinions on how well the Pentium 4 will perform, Yu said the NetBurst architecture will bring several new capabilities to the market. The Rapid Execution Engine, for example, will "turbocharge a piece of the engine," Yu said, by shifting repetitive tasks out of the main processing and into a specialized, accelerated computing center inside the chip. The Rapid Execution Engine will then be complemented by an Execution Trace Cache, a fast reservoir of memory designed to keep the engine packed with data. "The most interesting thing about the new architecture is the Execution Trace Cache," said Gwennap. "It will save a lot of time." The cache will hold commonly used instructions in the sequence in which they get executed. Therefore, when the processor has to repeat a calculation, it won't have to start at the beginning. Instead, it will be able to grab a set of pre-digested commands, cutting out a number of administrative tasks, he said. Other features will exist to speed data flow and make it more efficient. "Advanced Dynamic Execution" will speed processing by allowing the processor to recognize parallel patterns and prioritize tasks. In all, the chip will be capable of handling six instructions per clock cycle over extended periods. The Pentium III typically handles three. The chip also comes with 144 new multimedia instructions for better graphics and sound. By rewriting their software with the instructions in mind, software developers will be able to improve application performance. "The Internet is going from a text kind of thing to something more visual," Yu said. In addition, the Pentium 4 will contain a 20-stage pipeline. The pipeline is a processor's assembly line. While this means the Pentium 4 will have a line twice the length of the 10-stage Pentium III, the longer pipeline will create room for speeding up the chip. The length of the pipeline has created a debate among analysts concerning how the chip will perform. Longer pipelines allow processor designers to ratchet up the processor's speed. However, a longer pipeline creates "latency" problems. If an instruction gets misplaced at stage 18, the chip has to return to stage one. The trace cache will ameliorate many of these problems and lead to an overall improvement in speed, said Gwennap. Glaskowsky agreed but cautioned that the benefit may not be as big as Intel might want customers to believe. Whether Intel can manufacture the chip in volume will also be a major question at the conference and beyond, as the company has struggled to produce 1-GHz Pentium IIIs in significant volume. Yu said the Pentium 4 will be in volume production toward the end of the year. An Intel spokesman said that "hundreds of thousands" of the chips will come out this year. Historically, that would mean the Pentium 4 will be in shorter supply than when the Pentium II or other new chips came out, but likely in larger quantities than the first 1-GHz Pentium IIIs. In addition, as with the original Pentium, the basic architecture of the Pentium 4 will become the foundation of the company's processors for the next five to seven years. Following Moore's Law, this would lead to chips running at more than 11 GHz in 2006. "A microarchitecture typically lasts five to seven years, and this one is no exception," Yu said.
2006-09-22 - Intel to sell new Itanium servers  In another move to promote its new "Montecito" Itanium processor, Intel will begin selling "white box" systems that can be emblazoned with other computer makers' logos. White boxes, which are generic systems that companies can brand, are typically geared to market segments where it's harder for those companies to differentiate their products. Although Intel is best known as a processor maker, it also sells white box systems--both in bare-bones configurations or with memory and hard drives installed. Intel's two new white box models will be available in the fourth quarter and each accommodate as many as four Montecito Itaniums, the first in the high-end processor family to incorporate dual-processing cores. The two rack-mountable systems--a dual-processor SR9000MK4U, which is 3.5 inches thick, and a four-processor SR9000WG2U, which is 7 inches thick--use a chipset made by Hitachi to link the processors with subsystems such as memory, storage or input-output, Intel said. The company added it has discontinued making its own Itanium chipsets for the foreseeable future. Selling white box systems carries some risk of peeving those Itanium-based computer makers who already have server designs of their own and might not want competition from their processor supplier, but it also could help Intel, said Gabriel Consulting Group analyst Dan Olds. "They need to do something to spur Itanium demand, with Hewlett-Packard being the only other volume Itanium vendor. Intel certainly has the market heft to make a difference," Olds said. Itanium is becoming relatively mainstream, but it got off to a rocky start, and only one of the top four server makers sells computers that use it. Increasing the presence of Itanium servers in the market makes it easier to attract and maintain support from crucial software companies. French computer company Bull is the first customer for the new systems. In the past, others to use white boxes included Fujitsu and Dell, but Dell discontinued its Itanium product line in 2005.
2005-07-13 - Intel to roll out new Itanium chips    Intel is expected to announce next week what may be the last batch of single-core Itanium processors, CNET News.com has learned. According to a source familiar with Intel's plans, the chipmaking giant will introduce on Monday two Itanium 2 processors from its 64-bit Madison lineup. The chips will run at speeds of 1.66GHz, with computer memory cache sizes of 9MB and 6MB, respectively, and are expected to be snatched up by mainframe computer makers such as Hitachi, Fujitsu and Silicon Graphics Inc. Prices for the new Itanium processors were not made available at press time. Intel currently sells similar processors for as much as $4,227 in large quantities with a 400MHz front-side bus that speeds data to and from the chip. The new versions are expected to ship with a front-side bus that can reach 667MHz. A representative for Intel said Wednesday that the company does not comment on unannounced products, but the representative did say that the No. 1 chipmaker is working with its manufacturing partners to roll out new Madison parts as it starts to prepare for Intel's next-generation Itanium chip, code-named Montecito. Montecito employs dual-processing cores and is due to arrive at the end of 2005. "These are likely the last performance bumps before Montecito ships late this year," said Kevin Krewell, principal analyst for semiconductor research firm In-Stat. Krewell said the faster bus of the chips coming out Monday paves the way for the Montecito version, since the dual-core version will need faster bus bandwidth than a single-core processor. Intel and other chipmakers, such as Advanced Micro Devices and IBM, have all announced plans to transition their product lines to dual-core technologies in the next few years. The technology, which places two computer brains on a single piece of silicon, is expected to solve some of the heat and performance problems chipmakers are facing with future single-core designs. In concert with the Itanium product announcement will be a presentation by Japan's Hitachi, which is scheduled to show off its next-generation server sporting the new Itanium chips at a customer event in Japan on Tuesday, a source familiar with the launch said. Hitachi demonstrated the system on stage during Intel's Developer Forum back in March. HP, which co-developed Itanium and remains its chief advocate among computer makers, said its next major jump with Intel Itanium products will be on the Montecito chip.
2002-07-02 - Intel to release Itanium 2 at two speeds   Intel's upcoming Itanium 2 processor will come out at 900MHz and 1GHz, according to sources, and cost about the same as existing Itanium chips. In all, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker will release three versions of the 64-bit chip for high-end servers next week: a 1GHz version containing 3MB of level three cache memory, a 1GHz version containing 1.5MB of cache, and a 900MHz version containing 1.5MB of cache. The cache-speed variations will allow Intel to sell the chip at different prices, depending on performance. Increasing the clock frequency, measured by megahertz, generally increases performance, as does increasing the size of the cache, a reservoir of memory for rapid data access. Prices will range from about $1,300 for the 900MHz version to $4,200 for the 1GHz version with the 3MB cache, according to sources close to the company. Intel had announced the 1GHz chips earlier. Current Itanium processors sell for between $1,177 and $4,227. An Intel representative declined to comment on the release date, prices, or the existence of the 900MHz version of the chip but reiterated that the chips with the different cache sizes are geared to different markets. "In mission-critical areas, cache is king," the representative said. Itanium 2, formerly code-named McKinley, is designed to run in workstations and high-end servers containing four to 64 processors. Servers that contain the chip will compete against machines from Sun Microsystems and IBM. While servers containing Intel chips make up the majority of the server market in terms of units, Intel has yet to make a huge dent in the upper echelons of the market. Sixty percent of the revenue spent on servers, in fact, goes to non-Intel machines. The first Itanium chip, released a little more than a year ago, has not sold well. The Itanium 2, however, has been redesigned and will provide better performance, Intel has said. IBM and Hewlett-Packard are expected to announce servers based on the chip next week although Dell Computer has said it has no plans yet to adopt Itanium 2.
2002-04-15 - Intel to pay in chip patent dispute    update Intel has agreed to pay at least $300 million to settle a long-running legal dispute with Intergraph, which at one time developed its own microprocessor for high-end workstations, the companies said in a joint release. Under the terms of the deal, announced Monday, Intel will pay $300 million to settle claims that its Pentium lines of chips infringed on patents held by Huntsville, Ala.-based Intergraph. The company also agreed to pay up to another $150 million should a court overseeing a separate suit determine that Intel's Itanium chip infringes on Intergraph patents. Should Intel elect to appeal such a finding in the second suit, and lose, it would pay another $100 million, according to Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. Intergraph, which once made hardware but now focuses on services and software, in the late 1980s and early 1990s made a chip known as Clipper to power its workstations. In 1993, it scrapped the effort and switched to using Intel chips. However, patents received for that chip formed the basis of Intergraph's claim. The settlement brings to a close a more than four-year legal battle for Intel. Intergraph originally filed suit in an Alabama federal court in November 1997, alleging Intel violated antitrust laws, infringed on Intergraph patents, and violated state laws. Getting Intel to pay anything is a comeback for Intergraph. A judge threw out the antitrust portion of Intergraph's suit. The patent claims in the original suit were also thrown out initially, although an appeals court later reinstated them. Last July, Intergraph filed an additional claim in Texas alleging Intel's high-end server chip Itanium infringed on Intergraph patents. The court ordered settlement talks, which led to the resolution announced Monday. Intergraph was seeking $2.2 billion in damages on its original patent claims and was asking a judge to triple that amount. Mulloy said Intel was pleased with the settlement, which also results in Intel purchasing certain patents and both companies gaining a license to some of each other's patents. "After more than four years, we are pleased that we were able to reach an agreement that both disposes of the case and is in the interests of both companies' shareholders," Mulloy said. Intel said it plans to take a charge for half of the settlement amount in its first-quarter earnings, which are set to be released Tuesday. "I think it's obviously very significant," said David Vance Lucas, Intergraph's general counsel. Lucas said that Intergaph will now look to restart licensing talks with other computer makers that had been on hold since the Intel legal action began. Lucas said Intergraph believes there are companies that offer products that use Intergraph technology as well as other firms that could benefit by licensing Intergraph's patents. Although Intel did not concede the validity of Intergraph's patents, Lucas said the size of the settlement should influence other companies to license the technology. "I think that will certainly assist us in our licensing effort," Lucas said.
2002-06-18 - Intel to make Itanium 2 servers    Intel will manufacture complete servers and other components based on its upcoming Itanium 2 processor as a way to smooth acceptance in the market for the server chip. The upcoming product family, code-named Tiger, will include motherboards, chipsets, enclosures and a complete four-processor Itanium 2 server, according to a company representative. Intel will not sell these products to the general public, but to computer manufacturers, which will then re-brand them as their own or incorporate them into their own products. The Tiger family will come out in the second half of the year. Itanium 2, formerly code-named McKinley, is expected in July. Although Intel derives the bulk of its revenue from selling chips, the company has steadily expanded into motherboards, chipsets and, in some instances, complete computer design. Both Hewlett-Packard and IBM, for instance, sell servers for the telecommunications industry under their own respective brands that were designed and primarily put together by Intel. Buying a chassis or a complete server, rather than just a chip and other select components, drastically reduces the independent engineering generally required to bring a new server to market. In turn, this reduces costs and development time. "A number of our (server) units go into regional leaders," said Phil Brace, a marketing director for Intel. Kraftway, a Russian server maker, and Chinese giant Legend Holdings both purchase complete Intel servers and then subsequently adjust them for their respective local markets, he added. Easing acceptance for Itanium 2 is a leading obsession at the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company. The chip will go into servers that directly compete against the higher-end Unix machines from Sun Microsystems and IBM. Four-processor Itanium 2 systems will sell for between $20,000 and $72,000. Intel sells more chips than anyone else in the server market, but the vast majority of those chips end up in comparatively inexpensive one- and two-processor machines, which start at below $1,000. The first Itanium chip, though, has been a commercial dud. Delayed several times, the processor found few takers among computer manufacturers or corporate buyers. Middling performance, a lack of software and a declining economy also hurt Itanium, according to executives and analysts. Intel and others, though, assert that the experience with Itanium 2 will be different. The chip will provide twice the performance of the first Itanium, according to Intel. IBM, HP, NEC and other manufacturers have also invested heavily to develop servers, chipsets and other technology for Itanium 2 servers. A greater number of operating systems and databases will also be appearing around the time the Itanium 2 comes out. The company has also been working with third-party developers and hardware manufacturers in Intel offices worldwide to tune products for Itanium 2. "We're well cemented on our path toward IA-64 (the name of Itanium's architecture) tools," said Mike Fister, senior vice president of the Enterprise Platform Group at Intel. Itanium 2 will run at 1GHz when it comes out and will come in two types. One version will come with 1.5MB of level 3 cache memory. Caches, which are integrated into the processor, store data that needs to be accessed rapidly. A more expensive version will come with 3MB of cache. The 1.5MB and 3MB chips will actually look identical. Only half of the cache will be activated in the less-expensive version. In the future, Intel may eliminate the unused cache area on the 1.5MB chip to reduce its size and, hence, its manufacturing cost, Fister said.
2000-02-03 - Intel to detail new generations at conference  Following a year of product delays and increased competition, Intel plans to reassert itself in 2000 by introducing three microprocessor families meant to replace existing product lines. By fall, "Willamette" processors running at speeds greater than one GHz (gigahertz) and utilizing an enhanced data pathway will be seen in high-end desktop systems, while many lower-end PCs will contain the upcoming "Timna" processor, a derivative of the current Celeron that will contain integrated graphics capabilities. The first servers containing the Itanium chip, which will gradually replace Xeon, will also be out. Details of the new processors will be made available at the company's Developer Forum beginning Feb. 15 in Palm Springs, Calif. Along with a look at upcoming chip architectures, Intel will outline plans for expanding into the communications market and recruiting developers to write applications for the new processors, among other topics. Although Itanium will hit the market before Willamette and Timna, the latter two processors will probably garner more attention at the three-day conference. Far less is known about these two, so details will be finely scrutinized. Willamette will debut at speeds "well in excess of one GHz," said Pat Gelsinger, vice president and general manager of Intel's desktop products group. The chip is based on a different architecture than the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company's Pentium III, although both will run substantially the same software and share a large number of baseline characteristics, he said. People familiar with the chip have said it will incorporate a vastly improved "system bus," the processor's main conduit for data and a crucial element in performance. The bus will run at 200 MHz, these people said, faster than the 133-MHz bus on Pentium IIIs and equal to the bus on Advanced Micro Devices' high-end Athlon. In addition, the Willamette bus will be expanded from 64-bits wide to 128-bits wide. This means that more data will move to the processor at a faster rate, explained Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64, who noted, "They (Intel) haven't changed the bus width since 1993." Manufacturers will be able to match Willamette with high-speed Rambus-style memory, or the increasingly popular Double Data Rate memory. Willamette is due in the second half, with sources pinning it in the third quarter. Its sales could hit the ground running, analysts say. By contrast, Itanium sales are expected to get off to a slower start, according to a wide variety of industry observers. The 64-bit chip, Intel's first entry into a high-end market largely defined by such companies as Sun Microsystems and IBM, represents almost a complete break in design compared to its earlier processors. (The 64-bit designation refers to how the processor handles data, and is independent of a 64-bit bus.) Many think Intel's 64-bit chips may not sell in large numbers until the follow-up "McKinley" processor arrives in late 2001. While bullish on Itanium's marketplace acceptance, Gelsinger said the transition from Xeon, Intel's current and more conventional server chip, will be gradual. "Itanium will coexist with Xeon for a long time," he said. On the other hand, Willamette is likely to displace the Pentium III. "By the end of 2001, Pentium III is likely to be off the map," Brookwood said. The shift won't be as quick as the fairly easy leap from Pentium II to Pentium III, but shouldn't cause much of a fuss. "This is more like the transition from Pentium to Pentium Pro or Pentium II," Brookwood said. Intel also seems to have fairly high ambitions for a quick transition to Timna from Celeron. "This will become the primary product (in the "value PC" segment) by the end of the year," Andy Bryant, Intel's CFO, said at yesterday's Banc of America technology conference. "Originally it was designed as a way to reduce cost, but what we're learning is that you get performance with it. In a nutshell, Timna will be a version of Celeron integrated with a graphics chip and a memory controller, two components that typically exist on different pieces of silicon. "This is where you are going to see the promise of segmentation take place," he added, referring to the industry term for designing chip performance and price to appeal different markets. Timna will come out at 600 MHz and faster speeds when it debuts in the second half. Along with the processor efforts, Intel will encourage developers to write applications for all these architectures, said Dan Russell, general manager of the Intel architecture content services group. In particular, the company will work with e-commerce developers to create applications to run on Intel-based servers.
2005-02-07 - Intel to detail dual-core Itanium at conference    Montecito, Intel's first dual-core chip, will contain nearly 2 billion transistors but will run cooler than its existing relatives. A member of the Itanium family of server processors, Montecito will contain 1.7 billion transistors, making it Intel's first chip to crack the billion mark in transistors, and run at 2GHz, faster than existing Itaniums, according to Nimish Modi, vice president of the Digital Enterprise Group at Intel. Montecito, however, will sport a thermal ceiling, or maximum power output, of 100 watts, lower than the 130-watt ceiling of existing Itaniums and about equal to some of Intel's hottest desktop chips. Intel will publish a paper on Montecito, along with one on a silicon radio with multiple antennas, at the International Solid State Circuits Conference, or ISSCC, a five-day event in San Francisco that began Sunday. The Montecito chip is due out later this year. Improved power efficiency comes from a variety of new technologies, Modi said, including demand-based switching, which slows down transistors when not in use, and Foxton, which boosts the speed of the processor during peak workloads so tasks can be completed faster. Intel also narrowed the lines defining the channel, a region inside the transistor, to optimize performance at lower temperatures. Additionally, power is further consumed by not running the chip much faster than existing 1.6GHz Itaniums. "The whole goal is how do we maximize delivered performance," Modi said. Keeping power consumption down, particularly on multicore chips, is one of the dominant themes at the conference, one of the premier annual events for the semiconductor industry. Past conference highlights include the first papers on digital signal processors, or DSPs (Bell Labs, 1980), RISC chips (UC Berkeley; Stanford, 1984), 100MHz processors (Intel, 1991) and 1GHz processors (Digital; Intel, 2000). Among other highlights, IBM, Toshiba and Sony will provide details Monday and Tuesday on the Cell processor that will go into the PlayStation 3. Stream Processors, a start-up promoting energy-efficient image processors, will also publicly reveal some of its ideas, while a number of companies will discuss new concepts for cooling chips. Nanotechnology will be another dominant issue. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC, will describe a transistor that combines nanowires and multiple gates. Daeje Chin, minister of information and communications in South Korea, will formally open the conference with a keynote speech on nanotechnology and Korea's plans to promote the IT industry. Most of the sessions sail far above the head of the layperson, or even the computer hobbyist. On Tuesday, for instance, the University of California, Irvine, will present a paper titled "A 1.8V three stage 25GHz 3dB-BW differential non-uniform downsized differential amplifier," which will be followed by a presentation on a low-jitter spread spectrum clock generator from Silicon Image.
1999-10-28 - Intel to detail 2000 future plans in Webcast   Andy Grove, CEO Craig Barrett, and other high-ranking Intel executives will provide details on the current state of the company as well as a more granular look into its 2000 road map later this afternoon. Diversity will likely be one of the major undercurrents of the two-hour teleconference which will be broadcast over the Internet. Last April, the company formally reorganized into four distinct, relatively autonomous business units as part of a plan to become the "building block" supplier of the Internet. The largest unit controls the development of all PC-centric products. Although smaller, the three other groups, which are focused on networking chips, communications equipment, and services, have been the focus of intense activity. Over the past year or so, the company has acquired nine companies or separate divisions and spent more than $5 billion in the process. 2000 should be a fairly eventful year for Intel. The company is slated to release its first IXA network processors, chips that will serve as the nerve center for switches and other telecommunications equipment. Programmable network processors are expected to become a huge market. IBM and several start-ups are currently angling to establish primacy and market leadership in this area. Toward the middle of the year, the company will release Itanium, a 64-bit chip for servers and high-end workstations that will compete with processors from Sun Microsystems. Desktops will see changes as well. At the end of the year, the company has said that it will come out with Willamette, the code name for the family of chips that will succeed the Pentium III. Willamette processors will be based around a new architecture. By contrast, the P6 architecture, the basis of the Pentium III, has been around since the Pentium Pro. A slide shown at a Pentium III launch earlier this week showed that Intel plans to ship desktop processors running at 1 GHz by the end of the year. For budget PCs, the Celeron family of chips will likely see faster clock speeds and system buses, several Intel executives have said. Pentium III technology will also likely migrate to this line. Currently, Celeron chips are based around Pentium II cores. The company is also slated to release a chip called "Timna" in the third quarter, sources have said, that will fuse a processor, a graphics chip, and a memory controller into a single piece of silicon. Although integration tends to blunt graphics power, these chips are less expensive than conventional packages. Other speakers include Sean Maloney, senior vice president and director of sales and marketing, and Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel Architecture Business Group, the company's PC chip division. The Webcast, scheduled to take place between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., replaces the annual fall analysts' meeting. The next analysts' meeting will take place in New York next April.
2004-10-29 - Intel to debut new Itaniums Nov 8  Intel's newest top-line Itanium 2 processor is due to arrive Nov. 8, according to sources familiar with the plans. The processor, an upgraded member of the Madison line, boosts high-speed cache memory from 6MB to 9MB--thus its nickname: Madison 9M. In addition, Intel is expected to update the rest of its Itanium 2 family, adding a lower-end model for dual-processor servers and a low-voltage model for servers that are packed densely together. Related story Craig Barrett on theprice of success Intel's plain-spoken CEOsays that if the UnitedStates wants to stay ontop, it's time to rev thecompetitive metabolism. The launch is expected to dovetail with the release of the Top500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers. NASA's new Columbia supercomputer, a top contender for the No. 1 spot, includes the newer chips as part of Silicon Graphics Inc.'s new Altix 3700 Bx2 server. SGI had said Columbia could perform 42.7 trillion calculations per second, or 42.7 teraflops. But an unpublished test that included the new Itanium 2 9M processors clocked the machine at 51.9 teraflops. The newer chips in Columbia boost software performance significantly, Richard Dracott, general manager of Intel's enterprise platforms group, said Tuesday at the unveiling of the supercomputer. "We're seeing a 30 to 40 percent improvement in some of the codes," he said. Intel declined to comment on the schedule beyond reiterating that the chip will arrive by the end of the year. SGI had planned to unveil its Altix 3700 Bx2 on Nov. 1, but the company advanced the announcement after executives released details. Hewlett-Packard, the co-developer and biggest booster of Itanium, is staying mum until Nov. 9 about its new Itanium servers. HP is expected to announce a new entry-level dual-processor Itanium server. The move comes as Intel works to drive down Itanium costs; the current lowest-end Itaniums are priced at $530 each when purchased in quantities of 1,000. Itanium has had its lumps, including years of delay and shipments that still aren't meeting Intel's goals. The chipmaker no longer hopes to double its shipments of Itaniums this year; previously, the company had sought to go from 100,000 shipped last year to 200,000 this year, said Mercury Research analyst Dean McCarron. But Itanium has given Intel a competitor to high-end chips such as IBM's Power5 and Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc IV. "It's been a slow-growth product, but it certainly has expanded the markets Intel is participating in," McCarron said. Intel had hoped to launch the Itanium 2 9M product in September at the Intel Developer Forum, according to sources familiar with the plan. However, McCarron said the slip isn't significant. "These are going into very high-end servers with a very long qualification cycle," he said. The Itanium 2 9M is built on a manufacturing process with circuitry dimensions of 130 nanometers, or 130 billionths of a meter, Intel said. Next on Intel's agenda is a successor called Montecito due by the end of 2005 and built with a 90-nanometer process that lets more circuitry fit on a single chip. Montecito has dual processing engines, called cores, and each core can run two instruction sequences, called threads. After that comes Montvale, the first Itanium to be built using the 65-nanometer manufacturing process.
2004-01-14 - Intel to chip away at Itanium prices   Intel wants to remove price as a barrier to the acceptance of Itanium servers, a goal that could allow the processor to become the company's primary server chip in the second half of the decade. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker is working on chipsets and other products and technologies that will make an Itanium-based server no more expensive than a similar machine powered by its Xeon chip by 2007, said Mike Fister, senior vice president of the server products group at Intel. Because Itanium can provide more performance than Xeon, the elimination of the current, often substantial, price discrepancy could then permit Itanium to become Intel's principal server offering. If successful, the strategy could allow Intel to begin to phase out Xeon after 2006. "There is a projection that says that Itanium and our 64-bit technology is so powerful that someday it could kind of obfuscate Xeon" in the second half of the decade, Fister said. "It allows companies who have (Itanium) at the high end of the line to use it on lower-end applications." He added that Xeon will remain "robust through the middle of the decade" and live alongside Itanium. The emphasis on cost could help dispel some of the skepticism that tends to surround the Itanium line. Itanium is a 64-bit chip, which means that it can pull data from far more memory than 32-bit chips such as Xeon or the Pentium line. Itanium, however, primarily runs software specially designed for it, and there's comparatively little of that. To date, Itanium mostly has been used in servers with four or more processors--one of a number of factors that have kept sales relatively low. Although these boxes sell for $10,000 and up, unit shipments are limited. In 2003, Intel shipped 100,000 Itanium 2 chips compared with millions of Xeons. Research firm IDC in 2000 predicted that Itanium server sales would hit $28 billion by 2004. In 2001, IDC predicted sales of $15 billion by 2005, and lowered its forecast later that year to about $12.5 billion. Now, the forecast is for $7.5 billion in 2007. The vast majority of servers sold, in terms of unit shipments, contain one or two processors. Most of those servers rely on Intel Xeon chips, but IBM, Sun Microsystems and others are promoting the Opteron chip from Advanced Micro Devices for that market. Intel's price strategy helps "eliminate the barriers to move applications across," said Martin Reynolds, an analyst at research firm Gartner. Itanium "is too expensive to put it in everything. They have to get Itanium into the Xeon space." Intel will cut Itanium costs in a number of ways. The company, for instance, is tinkering with chipsets, similar to IBM's Summit chipsets, and other parts that can be used in both Itanium and Xeon servers. That way, hardware manufacturers will be able to cut design costs. Overall, Itanium chips sell for only a little more than Xeon chips, but the overall cost of building an Itanium server is higher. Cheaper versions of the chip also will be introduced. Last year, Intel debuted the Deerfield Itanium, which is priced similarly to Xeon chips. "We are going to evolve the line for breadth," Fister said. "There is no reason it has to be constrained" in the four-processor and more server market, he added. High-end Itaniums also will drop in price. Current top-end Itaniums can cost more than $4,200 because of extraordinarily large caches, pools of memory located on the processor. Top-end Itaniums now have 6MB of cache, and Montecito, a version coming in 2005, will have 24MB. Chips with large caches take up a lot of surface area and are expensive to make. Tukwila, formerly Tanglewood, a version of the Itanium that will be released after 2005, will feature a number of chip cores on the same piece of silicon. Although Tukwila will have a large cache, the chip cores will be smaller than Xeon cores, making the chip somewhat comparable in price. Software also will become more prevalent, which should help lower the price. Intel has already persuaded Oracle and others to port software to Itanium. Now the company is trying to get large corporate computer users to do the same. "There are corporations that have 2,000 total developers writing economic regression software," Fister said. On other Itanium notes, the company released software, called the IA-32 execution layer, that will let Itanium servers run standard Windows code with better performance than earlier emulation technologies. A version for Red Hat will come out later this year, Intel said. Also, speculation continues to swirl around whether Intel will release in the near future a version of Xeon or its Pentium chip that can handle 64-bit software, similar to what the Opteron and Athlon 64 lines at AMD do. Reynolds, among other analysts, asserted that Intel is almost certainly working on such a chip, but it's uncertain whether the release will occur in 2004, 2005 or later. Fister declined to comment on the chip. Other executives have said it could be released in the next three to five years.
2005-07-28 - Intel to borrow from laptops for server chips  One of the server chips Intel will release next year comes from an unusual place: its notebook group. A Xeon chip for blade servers due in the first half of 2006 derives from the Pentium M family, the company's notebook chip family, said Stephen Thorne, marketing manager of the server platform group at Intel. Code-named Sossaman, the chip puts out a maximum of 31 watts, fairly low for server chips, which can boast thermal ceilings of 110 watts. "We get a number of deployments where power is a big concern," he said. To this end, Intel will also release two low-power versions of the Irwindale Xeon chip in late 2005 that consume a maximum of 90 and 55 watts, respectively. The low-power Irwindales adopt some energy-efficiency techniques from the Pentium M but are largely based on the architecture of the existing Xeon line, which derives from the Pentium 4. The chip--part of a server chip road map update from Intel--underscores the growing problem of power consumption, but also the increasing influence of the Pentium M, a chip designed in Intel's Israel facilities with energy efficiency in mind. Pentium M sales have been one of the primary drivers behind the uptick in Intel revenue for the past few quarters. Some manufacturers are already putting Pentium M chips into desktops. By 2007, desktop chips derived from Merom, an upcoming version of the Pentium M, will come out. Other changes to the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip giant's road map were somewhat cosmetic. Rather than identify Xeon and Itanium chips by gigahertz, the chips will be sold under model numbers. Thus 5000-series Xeon chips will be for smaller servers, while the 7000-series Xeons will be for servers containing four or more processors. Itanium chips will be given numbers in the 9000 range. Intel's desktop and notebook chips are sold under numbers in the hundreds, such as the Celeron 350. Chipsets for business desktops, however, will now come with 3000 numbers. (Rival Advanced Micro Devices uses two-digit numbers for its mobile chips, three-digit numbers for server chips, and four-digit numbers for desktop chips.) Thorne further reiterated Intel's commitment to dual-core chips. Single-core Xeon chips will be phased out when the dual cores begin to arrive, which is expected to occur this year. By the end of 2006, 85 percent of the server processors shipped by Intel will be dual core, while 70 percent of the desktop and notebook ones will be.
2007-10-03 - Intel to boost single-core performance Intel plans to increase the performance of individual cores in the Itanium processor, and not just increase the number of cores to it, says an Intel engineer. Speaking at the Gelato Itanium Conference and Expo held in Singapore on Tuesday, Cameron McNairy, principal engineer of Itanium Processor Architect at Intel, said: "We have not abandoned single-core performance and we're looking to increase that with each generation (of the Itanium processor) as we go forward, some with greater transitions than others." Referring to the generation move from Itanium 2 9M to dual-core Itanium 2, McNairy said: "We made several changes, even though the core was essentially the same." Citing examples of the changes, he added: "We separated the instruction cache from the data cache, simplified some of the conflicts in the data cache, (and) increased core resources." The Itanium 2 9M chip, which debuted in November 2004, is an upgraded member of the Madison line. Dubbed Madison 9M, the 130-nanometer processor features high-speed cache memory from 6MB to 9MB. The Dual-Core Itanium 2 chip, also known as Montecito, was launched in July last year. The processor was built on a manufacturing process with circuitry dimensions of 90nm and has two processor cores. McNairy said improvements in "the single-stream performance" of a core processor can be expected in the next transition from Montecito to Tukwila. He said Intel will also be looking to increase the efficiency of its multithreading technology, also known as hyperthreading technology, but declined to reveal further details. While increasing the strength of individual cores of the processor is "intended to increase performance," McNairy noted, this may not apply to all workloads. "There are some workloads that you just need to have single-core performance in order to carry and to get the job done, and those are the kinds of things we are targeting," he said. "Not everything can scale and, truth be told, if you don't address the single-core performance segment, you're going to miss out on some opportunities." According to Intel, Montecito's successor, Montvale, will be launched later this year. The Tukwila chip is expected to arrive within the timeframe of 2008 to 2009, while Poulson is expected sometime between 2010 and 2011. Lynn Tan of ZDNet Asia reported from Singapore.
2002-06-04 - Intel to boost Itanium 2 servers   Intel will release new products later this year that let computer makers build servers with as many as eight Itanium 2 processors--and more if the manufacturers add their own improvements. The Intel E8870 chipset will be available late in the third quarter or early in the fourth, Doug Shuda, Intel's marketing manager for the product, said in an interview on Monday. Intel expects that server makers will use it chiefly for building four- or eight-processor servers, though it can be used to build 16-processor machines as well. Chipsets, which connect a computer's main processors with other parts such as memory, network cards and other processors, are key parts of computers. In multiprocessor systems--the kinds that run heavy-duty jobs such as logging purchases at a chain of department stores--good chipsets are crucial to overall system performance. Intel has had a spotty track record with server chipsets. The vast majority of Intel-based servers come with chipsets from Broadcom subsidiary ServerWorks, though Intel still profits because most of its money comes from processors. Intel formerly called the E8870 its 870 chipset, first announced in August 2000. Though the processor can work with either 32-bit server processors such as Xeon or 64-bit Itanium products, Intel has chosen to release it only with Itanium chips. The Itanium has been a difficult chip for Intel. The idea for the chip came from Hewlett-Packard, which approached Intel with hopes of making the product mainstream and low cost. But the Itanium line has been delayed several times. The processor family is designed for servers with requirements for data protection, large numbers of processors and copious memory. The first Itanium was largely a dud relegated to the unspectacular job of helping programmers overhaul their software for the new line of processors, but Intel has been raising expectations that the Itanium 2 sequel, due in mid-2002, will be better. Chipsets will help enable this future. The second-generation Itanium (Itanium 2), code-named McKinley, won't just come with chipsets from Intel. Other products will include HP's zx1 "Pluto" chipset for one- to four-processor machines; IBM's EXA "Summit" chipset for four-, eight-, 12- or 16-processor machines; Hitachi's ColdFusion-2 chipset for eight-processor machines; NEC's 32-processor chipset that builds on its 16-processor AzusA product that supported the first Itanium. Unisys also will support the processor in its 32-processor CMP systems. Intel's 8870 is used for four-processor servers. Combined with a high-speed switch called the Scalabilty Port Switch, the chipset becomes the E9870 and accommodates as many as four groups of four processors for a total of 16, though Intel expects most to stick with eight processors at most. The 9870 will be available by the end of the year, Shuda said. Through the use of other companies' switches, the 8870 building blocks can be stacked up to build systems with a whopping 512 processors, Shuda said. Unisys plans one such hybrid system with 16 processors, while French computer maker Bull plans a 32-processor system. Systems such as these will be available in the fourth quarter. Intel designed the E8870 chipset to last. Servers built around it will be able to accommodate not only Itanium 2, but faster successors including those code-named Madison due in 2003 and Montecito due in 2004, Shuda said. "We have a fair amount of headroom" to accommodate faster future processors, he said.
2002-10-31 - Intel to appeal Itanium injunction A U.S. District Court judge issued an injunction Wednesday that bars Intel from making and selling its Itanium processor, but immediately suspended that order to allow the chipmaker to appeal the ruling. After the order, an Intel representative said the company would pay Intergraph $100 million for a license to Intergraph's technology if it loses its appeal in the case. Earlier this month, the court ruled that Itanium violated patents held by Intergraph and ordered the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker to pay Intergraph $150 million. The court confirmed the ruling in Wednesday's order, which allows the appeals process to begin. Under an agreement reached between Intel and Intergraph in April, the companies stipulated that Intel would pay Intergraph $150 million if it lost the case. The companies further agreed that Intel would pay Intergraph an additional $100 million if it filed and lost an appeal. The additional $100 million payment, however, would also give Intel a license to Intergraph's patents, said an Intel representative. Alternatively, the two companies held out the possibility that they could negotiate a license on the patents. If Intel wins the appeal, it won't get the $150 million back, but it won't have to pay Intergraph any more fees and won't be barred from shipping Itanium chips.
2001-06-21 - Intel to aim Itanium at tough IT crowd Intel, in the midst of a stagnant market for new PCs, will use a technology show next week in New York to drum up interest in its powerful new processors. At next week's TechX NY trade show, formerly called PC Expo, the chip giant will lay out plans to ship a handful of new technologies in the coming months, according to Intel Executive Vice President Michael Splinter. Splinter will deliver a speech at the show Wednesday morning in an attempt to sway reluctant information-technology buyers by highlighting the processing power, and relative low price, of new servers based on the company's Itanium chip. Splinter will discuss Intel's newest products, including Itanium and the new Pentium III "Tualatin" chips, and may preview a pair of new Pentium 4 chips, expected next month. Despite the slow market for PCs and other computing and communications equipment, the chipmaker has launched a slew of products in the past two months. The keynote speech, intended to rally the IT audience behind Intel's chip strategy, comes at a critical time for the company. Intel, along with rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Transmeta, is suffering through a slowing PC market. Intel's processor shipments plunged 20 percent in the first quarter, compared with last year, and second-quarter shipments will be flat at best, Dan Niles, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, wrote in a report issued Wednesday. PC shipments were down 14 percent in the first quarter and are expected to drop 5 percent to 7 percent in the second quarter, Niles wrote. Niles cut his earnings-per-share estimates for both Intel and rival AMD due to "a continuing deterioration in demand for PCs," among other reasons. Other chipmakers are feeling the effects of a slowing market. On Thursday, Transmeta, which makes microprocessors for notebook computers and Internet appliances, said second-quarter revenue will be down 40 percent to 45 percent from revenue of $18.6 million for the first quarter of 2001. Intel CEO Craig Barrett said Wednesday that the company needs to see a recovery in the chip market within six months or it will consider cutting capacity and investments next year. The company is encountering some of its toughest competition from rival AMD. At TechX NY next week, AMD also will pitch IT managers on processors designed for business. The company is expected to tout its dual Athlon processor strategy for workstations and servers. AMD announced its dual-processor products earlier this month. Splinter is expected to woo buyers at the trade show by highlighting Intel's new chips in virtually every area of the PC business, from mini-notebooks to servers. The company intends to continue to invest in this strategy and the processors behind it to show its commitment to the business market, Splinter is expected to say. The Intel vice president also will demonstrate the Itanium chip for business users and will discuss customers that have plans to install servers using the chip. The 64-bit processor, launched in late May, is aimed squarely at the business market and was designed to offer greater performance than current Intel server offerings but lower prices than some of the large servers sold by companies such as Sun Microsystems. "What we are trying to do is bring the economics (of the PC) to the enterprise" with Itanium, Splinter told CNET News.com. IT managers "are the ones that we want to get a clear understanding of what we are bringing," he said. Intel will pull its chip offerings together "to show where we are and how serious we are about the space." One of the more important products for Intel will be the Tualatin Pentium III. Splinter is expected to confirm that Intel has been shipping this chip, manufactured with Intel's newest 0.13-micron manufacturing technology, since May. The chips that have been shipping are production-level processors, meant to stock customers with inventory. "We're not just playing around," Splinter said. Tualatins will come in a variety of forms. The first will be mobile processors. Intel will discuss these chips in a press conference Tuesday afternoon at the show. The company is expected to discuss the frequencies and low-power properties of the chips, as well as the launching of a new mini-notebook from Compaq Computer. The official Tualatin launch is expected in late July. The new Pentium III chips will also be available for desktop PCs and servers. "For ultradense servers, it is really a great product," Splinter said. "It will find its way into the desktop." However, "for the desktop, Pentium 4 is really the product," he added. Meanwhile, Splinter hinted that he might also discuss a pair of new Pentium 4 chips. As previously reported, Intel is expected to launch a 1.6GHz and a 1.8GHz version of the chip in early July. "I'll talk a little bit about Pentium 4," Splinter said. "I might touch on that."
2001-02-27 - Intel thumbs its nose at economy's downturn    Barrett: Intel prepared for economic upturnCraig Barrett, CEO, Intel SAN JOSE, Calif.--Although high-tech demand is slow, Intel will continue to invest heavily in development and new products, CEO Craig Barrett vowed Tuesday. "You never save your way out of a recession," Barrett told the audience at the Intel Developer Forum here. "The slowdowns are going to end, and you need to prepare for the upswing...the build-out of the Internet, the build-out of this digital world is still in its infancy." To that end, the company will plow about $12 billion into capital expansion and research and development in 2001, Barrett said. The list includes preparing the "McKinley" processor for servers, retrofitting factories for churning out chips made with copper wires, and developing a fairly extensive line of chips for notebooks and handheld devices. If there was a theme to Barrett's speech, it was back to the future. A year ago, the company touted how it planned to move into a wider variety of markets such as the server appliance and Web-hosting markets. Many of these efforts have floundered. And like other tech companies, Intel has announced cutbacks. So now, the message is silicon, silicon, silicon. Barrett and Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel Architecture Group, also outlined a number of products and initiatives coming in 2001 and early 2002. These include: The processor that is code-named "McKinley." The successor to the long-delayed Itanium chip, McKinley will begin pilot production at the end of the year. The chip will have a much larger integrated cache for better performance than the Itanium and three times the bandwidth, or data throughput power. The chip will provide eight times the performance of an equivalent UltraSparc chip from Sun Microsystems on some benchmarks, Otellini said. Barrett demonstrated the chip, which came out in samples only three weeks ago. "That's great progress for them to make after three weeks of silicon," said Linley Gwennap, principal analyst at the Linley Group. Strong emphasis on the "extended PC." Intel and Microsoft will aggressively market the idea of the PC as the nerve center of the home entertainment network. Pentium 4 computers and Windows XP, Microsoft's upcoming operating system, are ideally suited for manipulating or delivering video, audio, photographs and other media, the companies assert. Mobile Pentium III chips. A 700MHz Pentium III came out Tuesday morning. Later in the quarter, the 1GHz mobile Pentium III will be released. In the second half, Intel will begin to make notebook chips on the 0.13-micron manufacturing process. These chips will use copper wires, rather than aluminum ones. Consumers will also see better integration of Bluetooth and 802.11b wireless technologies in notebooks. Mobile Pentium 4 chips. Otellini said the company's latest desktop chip will hit portables in 2002, with sources putting the release date in the second quarter. In 2003, the company will come out with a brand-new mobile chip architecture designed for power-efficiency and wireless connectivity. Apple Computer has a similar effort afoot that, Barrett pointed out, followed Intel's kickoff at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. "Perhaps this is one of the few times that (Apple CEO) Steve Jobs followed us in the marketplace." Networking and communications will expand. "We're going to produce at least 35 new IXA (Intel Exchange Architecture) products this year," Barrett said. These chips go into telecommunications equipment and networking gear. Itanium server chips. The long-delayed server chip and the precursor to McKinley will come out in the second quarter. "The sheer complexity of the task--the number of variables--was really more work than any of us in the company imagined," Otellini said, explaining why the chip was delayed so many times. "We had to debug it. We have to develop a new chipset. We were working with four (operating systems), one of which was a stable platform." New technologies for interconnecting servers. Intel is preparing a competitor to Lightning Data Transport from Advanced Micro Devices, Otellini said. It will be unveiled Thursday. Intel's expansive product plans are based on a massive investment in infrastructure, Barrett said. The company is investing in machinery to make copper chips on the 0.13-micron process. In addition, Intel is investing to manufacture chips from 300-millimeter wafers, rather than 200-millimeter ones. Through the magic of geometry, the larger diameter increases the number of chips that can be produced per wafer by 225 percent. That will result in a 35 percent reduction in costs. "I think the investment will pay for itself in lower costs," Barrett said. "It is new technology and products that let you walk out of a recession." Barrett, though, added that the economic picture could change. "There is absolutely a slowdown in U.S. manufacturing. It hasn't spread to other markets yet," he said. If the malaise does move overseas, a wider recession could hit. "There's a potentially bigger problem that hasn't hit yet," he said. However, the international markets haven't synchronized downward in a long time. "That hasn't happened in nearly 30 years."
2002-06-19 - Intel tests samples of third Itanium chip  NEW YORK--Intel said Wednesday that it has produced samples of Madison, a third version of the Itanium processor, and has booted up "multiple operating systems" on it. Intel President Paul Otellini, speaking at a press briefing at the Securities Industry Association Conference here, said Madison is "alive and wiggles" and that the company remains committed to the Itanium family. "We will have (Madison) in production next year," Otellini said. "Itanium will be the enterprise architecture for the next decade." Itanium is Intel's family of high-end server chips, built into machines that compete against the top-of-the-line Unix/RISC servers from Sun Microsystems, IBM and Hewlett-Packard. Itanium chips boast substantial performance benefits because they process data in 64-bit chunks, rather than the 32-bit packets handled by Intel's Pentium or Xeon chips. The first version of Itanium didn't sell well, though. A second version--earlier code-named McKinley, but now known as Itanium 2--comes out next month. IBM, Unisys, Dell Computer and others are expected to launch servers containing four to 64 Itanium chips. The servers will start selling around $20,000. Madison is an enhanced version of Itanium 2. The Itanium 2 is being manufactured on the 180-nanometer manufacturing process and contains a Level 3 cache--a pool of memory integrated into the processor for performance--of 1.5MB or 3MB. Madison will be made on the 130-nanometer process, which means the chip will be able to run at faster speeds and will be capable of holding 3MB or 6MB of Level 3 cache. The nanometer measurement refers to the average size of components inside the chip. Smaller components are closer together, and it takes less time for data to move through and among them. Deerfield, a low-power, cheaper Itanium chip, will appear around the same time as Madison. It will cost less and consume less energy but will come with less cache. Otellini said Intel is not planning chips that can handle both 32-bit and 64-bit code. Bilingual chips, such as rival AMD's forthcoming Opteron, could be cheaper and easier for corporations to adopt, analysts have said, because much existing software will work on them. To get the full performance benefit out of Itanium, customers need brand-new software written for the chip. Sources have said that Intel is working on a chip, code-named Yamhill, that could read both types of software, although the chip won't come out unless Itanium sales really plummet. By forgoing greater compatibility, Itanium can provide greater performance and "all the other things people care about," Otellini said. Nevertheless, Otellini said Intel has reserved patents to extend its 32-bit Pentium and Xeon chips to handle 64-bit code. News.com's Michael Kanellos contributed to this report.
2002-06-19 - Intel targets Wall Street back offices Intel is stepping up its efforts to put its architecture into back office operations on Wall Street. Intel said Wednesday that it will broaden an alliance with Reuters to optimize the market data provider's products and platforms using the chipmaker's processors. The deal is notable because it may serve as a Trojan horse in an effort to dethrone Sun Microsystems in the financial services industry. Sun, with its RISC (reduced instruction set computer) chips and own brand of Unix, has long dominated the financial services sector, which spends roughly $26 billion on information technology a year. But with cost-cutting rampant on Wall Street, brokerages and others are looking to pare back on pricey computing products. For instance, Reuters recently said that it will port its data services from the Unix operating system to the lower-cost Linux alternative by the first quarter of 2003. Alexander Hungate, chief marketing officer at Reuters, said the company's clients are "using Linux to consolidate efforts and costs." The move would put Linux behind many of the computers that power trading floors, and Intel wants its chips tagging along. The combination of Linux and Intel has been gaining steam. For instance, Red Hat, in partnership with Hewlett-Packard, has begun selling a version of its Advanced Series Linux for Intel's Itanium chip. Intel President Paul Otellini, speaking at a press briefing at the Securities Industry Association Conference here Wednesday, said that the financial services sector is one of the company's target markets and that Intel-based computers are increasingly working their way into Wall Street's back offices. "We're making inroads at the brokerage houses," Otellini said. "It's a high-profile industry, which is why we target it." The Reuters deal will help put Intel on the radar of Wall Street's chief information officers. The two companies will advertise together and speak at industry conferences such as the SIA gathering, where Otellini is delivering the keynote address. Sun isn't going to sit still, however. On Tuesday, the computer maker announced its four-processor "Cherrystone" server, a key product to fend off Intel. Otellini said he couldn't comment on Cherrystone since he hadn't seen the price/performance specifications, but he expressed confidence that Intel's products were less expensive. "We're getting major wins at every account," Otellini said. "It's been a six-year effort."
2004-04-20 - Intel talks up telecom TV  BARCELONA, Spain--Intel's chief technology officer kicked off a company-sponsored conference here on Monday, outlining the chipmaker's ambitions in the markets for telecommunications and home entertainment. In a reprise of his recent speech at the Intel Developer Forum in the United States in February, CTO Pat Gelsinger told attendees at the IDF Solutions Conference that the technology industry is finally seeing sustainable growth in the long aftermath that followed the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000. The relatively slow uptake of Itanium 2, Intel's 64-bit, next-generation architecture, has led the company to produce a version of its Xeon processor with 64-bit addressing extensions. This allows the 32-bit processor to handle greater amounts of memory without needing to recompile existing applications. Microsoft is working on a version of Windows that uses these extended processors. Intel is keen to tap into the telecommunications sector of the market and sees wireless and optical technologies as the key. Gelsinger pointed out the rapid growth of Wi-Fi and stressed that WiMax wireless broadband will simplify building out network infrastructure. Get Up to Speed on... Wi-Fi Get the latest headlines andcompany-specific news in ourexpanded GUTS section. Optical communications is also an area for innovation. The company has recently created a silicon optical modulator chip that works at up to 1 gigabit per second, 50 times faster than previously achieved. Using silicon for the modulator makes fabrication cheaper. Gelsinger presented the prototype at IDF in the United States earlier in the year. Intel also sees a lot of growth in consumer technology, particularly in digital home entertainment; the new breed of entertainment PCs are generally based on Intel's desktop processors. Gelsinger said the Digital Home Working Group is creating a set of standards that allow interoperability between PCs, digital video recorders and other consumer products. Technologies such as ultrawideband wireless and liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) are real opportunities for growth in the home, according to Intel. Ultrawideband allows high-speed communication over short ranges, making video over wireless a possibility, while LCOS brings the benefits of silicon-based fabrication to displays, the aim being to bring down the cost of large LCDs (liquid crystal displays). "We want to bring Moore's Law to TVs," Gelsinger said. There was a 15-minute delay to allow delegates to pass through the tightened security at the conference center. Gelsinger was accompanied onstage by video clips of Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and of scientist Stephen Hawking, who revealed that his wheelchair computer is Intel-powered.

2003-02-21 - Intel takes slow road to 64-bit PC chips   SAN JOSE, Calif.--Advanced Micro Devices and Apple Computer will likely tout that they can deliver 64-bit computing to desktops this year, but Intel is in no hurry. Two of the company's top researchers said that a lack of applications, existing circumstances in the memory market, and the inherent challenges in getting the industry and consumers to migrate to new chips will likely keep Intel from coming out with a 64-bit chip--similar to those found in high-end servers and workstations--for PCs for years. "It could be the end of the decade" before mainstream desktops need more than 4GB of memory, one of the chief reasons to move to 64-bit chips, Justin Rattner, a senior fellow at Intel, said during an interview at the Intel Developer Forum taking place here this week. Rattner's comments echoed statements from Intel President Paul Otellini, who said in an interview last year that Intel may not be compelled to produce a 64-bit desktop chip until 2008 or even 2009. Intel, though, will examine ways that will allow the company's desktop line to take on some of the attributes of 64-bit chips. Currently, desktop and notebook processors like the Pentium 4 are 32-bit chips, meaning that they process data in 32-bit chunks; 64-bit chips can process data in 64-bit chunks. Among other benefits, 64-bit chips let computer makers put more than 4GB of memory into computers, the current ceiling for 32-bit systems. More memory lets a computer run more ornate applications such as complex databases or graphically intense software. AMD's Athlon64 chip, coming in September, will function as a 32- or 64-bit chip, depending on the software loaded onto the machine. IBM's PowerPC 970 will do the same thing. The chip comes out later this year, and Apple is expected to adopt it. Intel has a 64-bit chip family, the Itanium line, but sells the chips into servers that typically cost more than $10,000. Itanium chips do not run regular 32-bit applications well, and instead generally require software written for the chip family. Despite the advantages, converting a 32-bit machine into a 64-bit one isn't easy. Four separate design teams at Intel examined how the company could take one of its 32-bit chips and transform it into a 64-bit machine, said Richard Wirt, another senior fellow at Intel. After running simulations, all four teams concluded that such a transition wouldn't be economically feasible, he said. Another problem lies in the software. Windows software is designed to run on 32-bit systems. Transforming it to a 64-bit level will require an intense amount of work that few, right now, seem willing to tackle, Rattner said. One of the unpleasant surprises with Itanium, he added, has been that it has taken a number of years to get the software base developed. "We arrived with our 64-bit processor to learn that the databases have not yet arrived," Rattner said. Itanium's commercial acceptance initially was hampered because, until recently, "there hasn't been much OS support." The ability for PC makers to put more than 4GB of memory into desktops is also somewhat overstated, Rattner said. More memory Increasing the amount of memory in PCs in the future will depend on the ability of memory manufacturers to reduce the cost of memory chips. Generally, memory chips get cheaper by shrinking the size of the memory cells, the circuits on the chips that hold data. That's no longer easy. "It's getting harder to make DRAM cells smaller when the crossover (to putting 4GB of memories in PCs) is not 100 percent certain," Rattner said. "It is a ways off." A slowdown in turn would likely put a ceiling on the amount of memory that goes into mainstream machines. Typically, PC makers won't spend more than 8 percent of their costs on memory, according to memory and computer executives. Most desktops today come with around 256MB or 512MB of memory. A select few come with 1GB. Analysts' predictions generally follow Rattner's projection. By 2005, mainstream systems at the time will contain only 1GB of memory, according to Gartner, while most high-end systems will contain only 2.5GB. "The software just isn't there," added Sherry Garber, an analyst at Semico Research, who added that mainstream systems may not come with 1GB until 2007. AMD executives disagree, saying that consumers and developers will want the additional memory once a chip exists that will make it easy to buy. High-end consumers may even need the added memory in some circumstances because of the way applications will develop by 2004, the company has asserted. History also shows that memory prices can go down far faster than predictions. Game developers have said that 4GB computers could become popular rapidly, especially with online gaming. Nonetheless, AMD executives acknowledge that the price is a bit high right now. 4GB costs about $1,000, or more than most computers. Although dismissive of the need to shift, Intel is examining ways in which some of the advantages of 64-bit computing could come to the desktop. One avenue of exploration could involve improving the way Itanium chips run 32-bit software, Wirt said. Currently, Itanium chips do not run regular Windows code well. If this function could be improved, however, Intel hypothetically could begin to make energy-efficient versions of Itanium for desktops, Wirt said. Another technique for expanding the memory capacity of current 32-bit chips is through physical memory addressing, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst of Mercury Research. This involves altering the chipset so that 32-bit chips could handle longer memory addresses. Intel has in fact already done preliminary work that would let its PC chips handle 40-bit addressing, which would let PCs hold more than 512GB of memory, according to papers published by the company. "This is trivial to implement. It would probably take an engineer a week," McCarron said. Nonetheless, "they would have to get Microsoft and the application guys to cooperate." Another technique would be simply putting two processors into high-end machines. "There are a number of actions that don't necessarily require them to come out with a 64-bit chip," McCarron added. However, "if AMD gains traction, they will have to respond."
2001-09-06 - Intel takes running start at chip hurdles  After nearly two years of product delays, bugs, shortages and recalls, Intel says it has rooted out its operational problems--just in time to deal with potentially thornier pricing and market issues. "You had some particular causal events that drove us to the situation of a year and a year and a half ago," Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel Architecture Group, said in a recent interview. Struggles with Rambus problems and chip shortages were just some of the issues on Intel's plate at that time. "We went back to basics on basic engineering disciplines, and we're now doing the stuff that for all but two years of our 31-year history we did very well." Analysts agree, but caution that problems may still lurk. A 900MHz Xeon chip for multiprocessor servers, for instance, was pulled off the market in July because of a bug. The processor re-emerged last week. A larger hurdle for the chip giant may lay in soft demand for processors and plummeting prices. Intel is scheduled to give its midquarter sales update to Wall Street analysts late Thursday. "They still are having some problems, but they sound more like design problems rather than process (manufacturing) issues," said Kevin Krewell, an analyst with MDR/Instat. "So far it looks OK. Part of it, though, is the recession. When demand is slack, you don't push your yields. It is not the time to detect flaws in the system." Avoiding manufacturing problems will be crucial in both curbing competition from Advanced Micro Devices and fulfilling a fairly ambitious product strategy. Some of the company's upcoming projects: Pentium 4 notebooks are expected by the first half of next year.A new chip called "Banias," designed to dramatically reduce power consumption, is slated for 2003.A new version of the XScale processor will appear in handheld computers early next year.In servers, demo units of McKinley, the touted successor to the current Itanium chip, will come out at the end of this year. As for desktops, the first desktop chips based on the 130-nanometer (0.13-micron) manufacturing process--which allows smaller features to be printed on chips--come out in the fourth quarter. These chips will feature copper, rather than aluminum, wires. Copper chips are already inside notebooks, but selling them into the desktop market will require Intel to produce these chips in far larger volumes. "From an execution standpoint, they have pretty much resolved their problems. There's been a focus on it and some heads have rolled," said Joe Osha, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. "But the big question is pricing...Prices are just going to keep going down." History lesson For the most part, Intel's lingering illness derived from two non-recurring issues, according to Otellini: Rambus memory (RDRAM) and the aging of the Pentium III design. "There were two root causes. One was the difficulty in coming out with RDRAM systems," he said. "The other was with extending the life of the Pentium III. The Pentium III was at the end of its life...From 900MHz to the end of that one was very difficult." The Rambus problem has been ameliorated through a variety of factors. In 1999, Rambus was slated to be the memory of choice for Intel desktop chips, including an upcoming chip for budget PCs called Timna. The honeymoon didn't last long. Bugs in the 820 chipset, which paired the Pentium III with Rambus-based RDRAM, delayed the release of a number of desktops in late 1999. Around this time, AMD began to gain market share with its Athlon chips. To get around the problem, Intel released a chipset that worked with standard memory and canceled projects such as Timna, which had a built-in Rambus controller. Although the Pentium 4 still needs to be paired with RDRAM, chipsets that will let manufacturers couple the Pentium 4 with cheaper types of memory, such as SDRAM and DDR DRAM, are coming to market. These products will be hugely popular with PC makers, according to, among others, Dean McCarron, principal analyst of Mercury Research. Meanwhile, RDRAM has continued to drop in price. The problems with extending the life of the Pentium III were conquered by time and the arrival of the Pentium 4. The severe chip shortage of late 1999 began to ease up toward the middle of 2000, ironically just before the downturn in the economy. "They ran into problems with Coppermine (the code name for the last generation of Pentium IIIs) because of sudden and rapid demand," Krewell said. Even though sales began to slow, Intel still had to battle with AMD over performance bragging rights, a key element in chip marketing. The new chip allowed Intel to move past the 1GHz level and, eventually, firmly ahead of Athlon. The Pentium 4 now runs at 2GHz, while the Athlon tops out at 1.4GHz. In terms of performance on common computing tasks, the 2GHz Pentium 4 still wins out, but not by as wide a margin as the megahertz numbers might suggest, according to benchmark testers. The company also reorganized its internal divisions and tightened up quality control. In the old organization, chipset engineers and processor engineers worked in separate divisions, Otellini said. Chipsets and processors, however, are interdependent: The chipset exists to fetch and deliver data to and from the microprocessor. Coordination between the product groups began to decline. Working together In 2000, the groups were realigned by product categories. Engineers designing chipsets and processors for notebooks were put in the same group, for instance, while server and desktop chip development were reorganized in a similar fashion. "The execution got better because the chipset guys talked to the processor guys," he said. "You've seen us execute like clockwork on the Pentium 4." Unexpectedly, reorganization led the way toward a form of technological cross-pollination. Energy-efficiency technology from the notebook group, for instance, is ending up in servers. "There are architectural techniques that were invented out of need that are yielding circuit technology that can be used across the line," Otellini said. "That is a second-order effect that we are now just getting to touch." So far, the company appears to have managed the transition from the 180-nanometer to the 130-nanometer manufacturing process. The new process, which involves shrinking the architectural elements of the chip, will lead to smaller, faster and ultimately cheaper chips. Next year, the Pentium 4 desktop is slated to hit 3.5GHz. "The (130-nanometer) process is ramping like a hose," said Frank Spindler, vice president of Intel's mobile products group. Most analysts contacted have generally agreed that the company's manufacturing issues have been put to rest. Still, demand is going to remain an open question. "There will still be some potholes in the road, but it won't be anything on the magnitude of the past two years...The bigger issue is, when does the demand turn?" said Ashok Kumar, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "Economic cycles overturn manufacturing cycles."
2001-05-18 - Intel takes on Sun with telecom servers    Intel, looking for new sources of revenue, will challenge Sun Microsystems by launching a line of telecommunications servers later this year. On Thursday Intel announced plans to build telecommunications servers and sell them via PC makers or telecommunications-equipment companies. Intel said the move will challenge Sun, which enjoys a healthy telecommunications-server business. The move is reminiscent of Intel's earlier moves into the high-end workstation market, where Sun is also a major player. The telecommunications thrust is classic Intel: Attack an established competitor in a new market with large numbers of inexpensive computers offering "twice the performance for half the price," said Abhi Talawalker, vice president and general manager of Intel's Enterprise Platforms and Services Division. "One of the areas where we have not been very active has been in the telecommunications and communications space," Talawalker said. The new server products "are responding to a decent amount of interest (Intel has seen) over the past few years" from customers in that market. Intel will not sell the servers directly to telecommunications customers. Following a model the company established with its network-appliance systems, Intel will sell the servers to PC makers and to telecommunications-equipment companies, which will then add operating systems and applications and resell them to customers. In 1997, Intel launched an effort to break into the workstation market. The company signed up PC makers to build workstations that would challenge the machines sold by Sun and Silicon Graphics, which at the time offered a high-end workstation based on its own processor. Known as NT workstations after Windows NT, the machines were initially more like high-end PCs and could not match the performance of a Unix workstation. However, the NT workstation took off in market share thanks to its lower price, sometimes less than one-third of that of a Unix workstation. PCs out, servers in Success in the telecommunications market would also mean a healthy boost to Intel's bottom line. While PC margins continue to shrink, servers are still commanding relatively high prices. Analysts said on Thursday that Intel could make inroads with its new servers in areas where companies are looking to expand--such as wireless--but only if the company can meet the stringent requirements of telecommunications customers. Cost is not the only thing telecommunications companies evaluate when they choose new servers. Intel will also need to demonstrate that it can offer reliability, analysts said. Telecom companies may also consider the ease of upgrading servers as well as their overall cost to maintain before buying. Many companies keep equipment for as long as five to 10 years. Executives from Sun agreed that building telecommunications servers consists of more than assembling hardware or hitting a low price. Sun introduced its first NEBS certified telecommunications server, the Netra, in 1999. Executives at the company believe that over the average life of a telecommunications server, which ranges from five to as many as 20 years, the initial price is less important than built-in abilities such as being able to perform a repair or upgrade--adding a faster processor, for example--in the field. "Every component of my Netra CT servers is field replaceable or repairable," said Bret Martin, a group manager inside Sun's Network Equipment Provider Division. "This gives (telecom companies) the ability to increase the horsepower as we move forward (with technology) without changing out the machine again. It's the serviceability, the reparability and the maintainability that separate us." Hewlett-Packard on Thursday announced it would use the new Intel servers in machines aimed at voice and data networks. The companies, in addition, opened a joint "telecommunications solutions center" in Grenoble, France, where much of HP's PC division is based. The center, among other functions, will offer a place for potential Intel server customers to test the new equipment. It will also allow software developers to test their work. Intel plans to begin shipping single- and dual-processor Pentium III-based servers in 1U (1.75 inches high) and 2U chassis in the fourth quarter. The servers will meet telecommunications specifications, such as NEB Class III, which requires that servers be able to withstand conditions such as fire or earthquake. The first servers will be based on Intel's forthcoming 1.13GHz "Tualatin" Pentium III chip. Tualatin is Intel's code name for Pentium III chips manufactured using the company's new 0.13-micron process. Intel plans to follow up on these first telecommunications servers with later servers offering its new Xeon and Itanium processors.
2000-02-16 - Intel Sun feuding over upcoming chips  It used to be Microsoft vs. Sun Microsystems. Now it's turning into Intel vs. Sun. A simmering feud between the two over an effort to bring Sun's Solaris operating system to servers running Intel's upcoming Itanium processor has now burst into the open. Intel said today that Sun hasn't been pulling its weight in the partnership and that Intel will drastically reduce the resources it's devoting to the effort. "We have not seen the same level of commitment as measured by engaging customers or getting" participation by software companies, said Stephen Smith, general manager of Intel's 64-bit chip program. "The momentum is behind the three other operating systems." Intel will continue to support Solaris on Itanium, the first chip of the IA-64 family, but will dramatically decrease the resources put toward it, he said. For its part, Sun was surprised and dismayed by the move and suggested Intel is afraid to compete with Sun, which makes servers based on its own UltraSparc chips. "Apparently they see us as a huge threat," said Anil Gadre, president of Sun Solaris. The move indicates that Sun is an expendable partner in Intel's effort to spread its upcoming 64-bit chips as widely as possible. Sun also competes with Intel by selling servers based on its own UltraSparc chips. "It's funny that Sun is as surprised as they are," said Cal Braunstein, an analyst with the Robert Francis Group. "They have not been that overwhelmingly moving forward with their Solaris-on-Intel platform. It's not that they don't have the support, but it's certainly not their highest priority." Nearly every Intel executive at the Intel Developer Forum in Palm Springs, Calif., seems to be touting a future for Intel that positions it as Sun's closest competitor. Intel wants to be the hardware powerhouse in e-commerce, for instance, a Sun stronghold today. In many ways, the feud could shape up as a battle of beauty over brawn. Sun develops architecturally interesting servers. Intel's plan is to persuade customers to buy lots of smaller servers that in the end will cost less. The IA-64 chip family is the spearhead of Intel's effort to sell chips for expensive, high-end servers that today use chips from IBM, Sun, Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard or SGI. Intel has been helping many companies move their operating systems to the IA-64 chip family in an effort to make its chip the "unifying architecture" that would be part of all these company's product lines. Though Intel still has strong hardware support, the number of operating systems planned for IA-64 computers has been dropping. SGI backed Linux instead of its in-house variant of Unix. Compaq dropped plans to have its own Tru64 Unix run on IA-64. And IBM and Santa Cruz Operations teamed up their two efforts into a single software package called Monterey-64. Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel Architecture Business Group, said: "We are going to continue to meet our contractual commitments to Sun, (but) we don't see the momentum and support for features that Sun has committed to Itanium and to Intel being delivered in the marketplace," he said. "We will focus our efforts elsewhere." Sun's Gadre said Intel will suffer from its decision, because Solaris is a popular foundation for e-commerce software. "We have the world's finest operating environment that can make IA-64 a reality in the enterprise. It looks like they're not interested in that," Gadre said. In addition, Intel is disrupting the product plans of Fujitsu, Siemens and NCR, companies that have pledged to build Itanium computers with Solaris, Gadre said. "What message (is Intel) sending to them? They bet on IA-64 and thought the right OS was Solaris," Gadre said. Gadre also said Sun has had a strong commitment to Intel chips, devoting more than $100 million to its effort to develop Solaris on Intel chips. The Linux wave The arrival of the Linux operating system freed Intel from its dependence on Sun, Braunstein said. "Now with Linux coming aboard and everybody buying into Linux as the next big wave here, I think Intel feels they now can put adequate pressure on Sun to say, 'You may have to reconsider your strategy,'" Braunstein said. Dell Computer, long one of Intel's strongest allies, seems to be in agreement with Intel. Chief executive Michael Dell said his company has decided against an earlier possibility of Solaris on its Itanium machines but is instead favoring Linux and Windows 2000. "Those two operating environments are particularly attractive to us," said Carl Everett, senior vice president of Dell's personal systems group. "Our offer to Dell stands," Gadre said. Intel doesn't appear to be feuding with IBM, which like Sun has plans to bring its own version of Unix to the IA-64 chips. IBM said today it will release on Feb. 29 early test versions of Monterey-64 to a group of testers so they can begin making sure their software will work on Monterey-Itanium machines. "We've got a fantastic relationship" with Intel, said IBM's Miles Barel. Intel's decision may be angering Sun, but Intel executives didn't hold back in expressing their dissatisfaction. "We've been at this for multiple years. When you do that, you expect some return," said Pat Gelsinger, vice president of Intel's desktop products group. Stephen Shankland reported from San Francisco and Michael Kanellos from Palm Springs.
2004-05-20 - Intel sued for patent infringement All Computers, a manufacturer of computer parts, is seeking $500 million from Intel in a patent infringement lawsuit it filed Thursday morning. In the suit, Toronto-based All Computers alleges that Intel's Pentium processors violate an All Computers patent related to the way high-speed microprocessors operate. In addition to compensatory damages, All Computers is seeking a permanent injunction to stop the chipmaker from shipping any processors or other chips that contain or work with the circuitry protected by the patent, said Edward O'Connor, the company's lawyer. "We believe the suit is without merit and plan a vigorous defense," Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said in an e-mail. The suit is one of several recent disputes involving Intel chips and customers. In April, Patriot Scientific, a small San Diego semiconductor design company, sent letters to 150 companies, telling them that they might be infringing on one of its chip patents because of their use of Pentium chips that run at speeds faster than 120MHz. Patriot has also filed suit against five companies, including Japanese PC manufacturers Fujitsu, Matsushita Electric, NEC, Sony and Toshiba, alleging that they infringed the Patriot patent by selling computers that, again, contain Pentium chips that run at 120MHz or faster. Patriot alleges in the letters and the suits that the companies are violating a patent for technology related to the way high-speed processors keep time. Patriot claims that its intellectual property has been incorporated into $150 billion worth of chips. Intel has said it also believes that Patriot's claims are invalid. The chipmaker, however, has settled other patent disputes. Intel has agreed to pay Intergraph, a one-time manufacturer of computer workstations, a total of $675 million to settle a pair of lawsuits that alleged that Intel Itanium and Pentium chips violated patents for Clipper, a processor developed by Intergraph. The All Computers patent in question is U.S. patent No. 5,506,981, titled "Apparatus and Methods for Enhancing the Performance of Personal Computers." It was awarded in 1996. The patent describes circuitry necessary for high-speed processors to communicate with other elements of a computer, O'Connor said. He said the patent could also apply to other processors and the products that contain them, raising the possibility for other patent suits by All Computers. The company offered to license the patent to Intel, but O'Connor said All Computers did not hear back from the chipmaker. All Computers, which has sold products such as a card designed to enhance PC memory, was founded in 1971 by Mers Kutt. Kutt introduced the MCM-70, an early personal computer, All Computers said in a statement.
2000-12-20 - Intel stumbles AMD gains in 2000   | update What caused Intel to stumble in 2000 and Advance Micro Devices to enjoy one of its best years ever? A lot of little events in 1998. Back then, Intel lorded over AMD. Craig Barrett, who succeeded Andy Grove as Intel CEO in March 1998, kicked off a strategy to diversify the company's revenue base. AMD, meanwhile, was struggling with financial losses and sporadic inventory and manufacturing problems. Analysts questioned whether the company would have to find co-tenants to help pay for its planned fabrication facility in Dresden, Germany. In the background, seemingly innocuous events began to transpire. In the middle of 1998, Intel halted construction on a plant in Fort Worth, Texas, because of the tepid economic outlook in Asia and the failure of a tax reform bill in the Texas legislature, according to Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. Around the same time, Intel engineers in Folsom, Calif., were discovering that the upcoming 820 chipset for faster Pentium IIIs (code-named Coppermine) and a then relatively obscure memory technology called Rambus weren't working together as planned. "Rambus clearly was more difficult than people expected," recalled Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64. "Intel had to go back and learn about how to channel these high-speed signals on a motherboard...They were getting all sorts of subtle problems. They had to substantially upgrade the equipment they had in their labs and rethink how they did testing." Meanwhile, one exit north on Highway 101 in Sunnyvale, Calif., AMD was working on a chip called the K7. Dirk Meyer, a Digital Equipment alumnus and director of engineering at AMD, managed the project, which he would describe at the Microprocessor Forum in October. How times change Flash forward to the first half of 2000. Intel found itself mired in a dire processor shortage caused in part by a series of delays in 1999 of the 820 chipset and other parts. The scrapping of the Fort Worth plans also was having an effect. "That decision has had some consequences this year," Mulloy said. In addition, Rambus memory had failed, as predicted, to come down in price. To spur sales of Coppermine Pentium IIIs, Intel came out with a bridge chip called the Memory Translation Hub (MTH) that was supposed to allow Pentium III PCs to use cheaper standard memory. An MTH-related recall cost Intel $253 million and, more importantly, gave a black eye to its sterling reputation for manufacturing. In June, Intel canceled Timna, an inexpensive processor that would have been paired with the MTH. Non-Rambus problems cropped up too. The release schedule for Itanium, a 64-bit server chip destined to take on Sun's UltraSparc processors, was pushed back to 2001. The 1.13-MHz Pentium III was recalled. "In a little bit of our haste or excitement to get out the product, we didn't go through all of our traditional product validation," said Jeff McCrea, marketing director for Intel's desktop products group. The company managed to come out with the Pentium 4, perhaps the bright spot of the year. Still, partly because software has yet to be tweaked for the chip, benchmark tests have shown the chip to provide middling performance improvements. By contrast, AMD was seeing tremendous consumer acceptance with Athlon, the public name for the K7. With the new chip, AMD took the speed crown from Intel, landed contracts with all the major PC makers but Dell Computer, and obtained a new reputation for high-performance technology. It also didn't face shortages to the same degree. For the first time since 1995, the company will post an annual profit in 2000. AMD's turnaround While AMD's market share hasn't radically improved, its place in the market has moved. Rather than being confined to the low end, the company now has a spot in the more lucrative performance segment. In the U.S. retail market for PCs in the $1,000 to $1,500 range, AMD saw its market share go from 3.3 percent in May to 22.8 percent by September, according to figures from PC Data. Key to the company's success was improved manufacturing. Historically, AMD has flubbed chip launches, leaving them vulnerable to Intel price cuts. "They went from having a product they couldn't build to having a product they could," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. The credit for turning around the manufacturing situation belongs largely to Bill Siegel and Jim Duran, two AMD executives, said Kevin Krewell, an analyst at MicroDesign Resources and a former AMD employee. Intel has always prided itself on a manufacturing methodology called "copy exact" in which each fab is identical to the next, allowing the company to accelerate manufacturing on a new chip. "AMD had a process called 'somewhat similar,'" Krewell joked. Siegel, a former IBMer, began to correct AMD's situation in the mid-1990s, but the real benefits of his work came to the fore with Athlon. Duran, meanwhile, worked at both the Austin and Dresden facilities to see that the manufacturing improvements were carried out. "He was sort of the behind the scenes guy who ironed out the problems at Austin," Krewell said. "It was really those three guys," Meyer, Siegel and Duran. Additionally, some of the credit for the turnaround, Brookwood said, goes to Atiq Raza, AMD's former president, who left in 1999. Brookwood also gives credit to the new German plant. "It was a piece of luck that (Athlon) came out just when the industry had a capacity shortage and they had a product the industry wanted," Brookwood said. In addition, the Dresden plant allowed AMD to shift relatively painlessly to producing chips with copper, rather than aluminum, circuits, a migration that has caused problems for some other manufacturers. Intel will make the copper jump this year. Of course, both companies now face a new dilemma. Because of a worldwide economic slowdown, both Intel and AMD have warned that fourth-quarter revenue will be lower than expected. "What they are praying for is that PC demand is less than expected," said Nimal Vallipuram, an analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. The two will also face new challenges in notebooks. Transmeta burst onto the scene with its Crusoe chips, which consume less power than other chips, according to the company. Low power consumption became a reigning theme in notebooks. Despite a few hitches, Transmeta landed contracts with Sony, Hitachi and Gateway and saw its stock price more than double on its first day of trading. Who will win? Stay tuned for the next two years.
2001-08-28 - Intel spotlights its chip changes  The company brings new brawn and speed to its lineup of chips. The next version of its server-centric Itanium, for instance, will benefit from a much faster bus, additional microstructures and a more efficient memory cache.

2005-08-15 - Intel speeds dual-core Xeon debut  Intel plans to release its first dual-core server processors this year instead of next, and it will employ an unusual maneuver to catch up to rival Advanced Micro Devices in the key competitive area. Intel's "Paxville" version of Xeon, designed for machines with four or more processor sockets, now is due in 2005. And in a novel move, Intel will also release a version of Paxville for lower-end dual-processor servers. Paxville has dual processing engines, called cores, a technology that means a single chip can do much of the work that previously required two chips. AMD released its first dual-core Opteron processors in the first half of this year, including models for four-processor and the more widely used two-processor servers. Both companies sell dual-core processors for desktop computers. Intel's Paxville move "is clearly a time-to-market vehicle, a reaction to at least the perception of success that AMD is enjoying with Opteron," said TechKnowledge Strategies analyst Mike Feibus. "I don't think it'll make a dent in Intel's overall sales. It's more for chest-thumping purposes." Previously, Paxville was officially scheduled for release in the first half of 2006, though an Intel executive disclosed in March that it was expected in the very early part of the year and Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini hinted at the dual-core speedup in July. Intel spokeswoman Erica Fields wouldn't comment on exactly how much sooner Paxville was expected, but said of the schedule, "It is a significant pull-in." Dell will sell dual- and four-processor servers based on Paxville this year, spokesman David Lord said on Monday. Hewlett-Packard, which unlike Dell sells servers with AMD as well as Intel processors, also plans to support Intel's updated dual-core debut with dual- and four-processor machines by the end of 2005, spokesman Eric Krueger said. IBM, which is trying to stand out from its competitors with high-end Intel-based servers, is keen to release its next-generation servers with the high-end Xeons. "IBM anxiously awaits the arrival of Intel's first generation 64-bit Xeon MP, dual-core processors," Jay Bretzmann, director of IBM's high-performance Intel server division, said in a statement. The dual-processor version of Paxville won't replace what Intel expects to be the mainstream dual-core design for dual-processor servers. The mainstream part, code-named Dempsey, is due in 2006. Dempsey, a more mainstream design, will be less expensive than the dual-core Paxville chips, Fields said, though she declined to disclose specific prices. The dual-core Paxville chips will run at 2.8GHz, come with 2MB of high-speed cache memory, a 800MHz front-side bus for communications with the rest of the system, and include the Hyperthreading feature for speeding execution of independent software tasks, Fields said. The combination of Dempsey and a new chipset code-named Blackford make up the "Bensley" platform. Among Bensley features that Paxville-based systems lack is a faster fully buffered memory technology, called FB-DIMM, a faster communications bus speed and a faster overall processor speed. Compared with the dual-core Paxville processor, "Dempsey is more elegantly designed," Feibus said. Intel currently is developing 17 multi-core processor designs. The company expects more than 85 percent of its server processors to have two or more cores by the end of 2006. Xeon, like Intel's Pentium and AMD's Opteron and Athlon, is a member of the x86 chip family, but Intel expects to release a dual-core Itanium processor by the end of this year.
2000-07-19 - Intel skates past estimates on booming chip demand Despite major product shortages and intensified competition from Advanced Micro Devices, Intel managed to beat expectations in the second quarter by reporting record revenue of $8.3 billion and earnings per share of 50 cents, excluding extraordinary events. The company was helped by surging demand for microprocessors and flash memory, two components that have been in critically short supply since last year. The shortage has allowed companies like Intel to sell off virtually everything they make as well as avoiding price wars. The picture should continue to improve in the third quarter, added Andy Bryant, Intel's CFO, as both PC demand and Intel's ability to deliver chips improve. "Manufacturing performance is improving product availability," he said. "We expect demand to continue to be strong. We expect supply to improve but continue to be tight." Intel's numbers will likely be the source of debate for days to come because of a number of extraordinary one-time events, including acquisition costs, recall costs and a massive gain in investment income from selling shares in Micron Technologies. Nonetheless, Intel appears to have cleared most hurdles. Intel shares rose almost 5 percent, to around $146, in after-hours trading, after decling more than 3 percent during regular trading. Overall, the company reported net income, excluding acquisition costs, of $3.5 billion for the quarter, or 50 cents a share. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson expected the company to report earnings of 49 cents a share. The numbers account for a two-for-one stock split executed today. Without the split, earnings per share excluding acquisition costs came to $1. Analysts expected 98 cents. Intel's gross income was boosted by $2.3 billion in gains from investments, as expected by analysts. The company beat estimates by a penny. Ignoring all of the unusual events and outside stock activity, earnings came to 36 cents a share, said Bryant. "Revenue was up 23 percent and set a record," he said. "With or without the unusual gains and expenses, earnings growth year-to-year was substantial." Including acquisition related charges, second-quarter net income came to $3.1 billion, or 45 cents a share. Revenue also came in higher than expected. Revenue for the second quarter came to $8.3 billion, which represents a 23 percent hike from revenue of $6.7 billion the year before and a 4 percent hike over revenue for the previous quarter. Most analysts expected revenue to stay generally flat at around $8 billion. Although profits came in slightly above expectations, the increase in revenue surprised analysts. Typically, revenue declines in the second quarter due to season slowdowns. "The revenue was a little bit up on increased unit shipments," said Dan Scoval, an analyst with Needham & Co. "That is highly unusual for a second quarter." Comparisons to last year's second quarter are skewed because of the unusually large investment gains. Last year, Intel reported net earnings of $1.7 billion, or 26 cents a share, on revenues of $6.7 billion in the second quarter. This represents a 92 percent increase in earnings. However, Intel at that time only racked up investment income of $290 million. "Strong worldwide PC and server demand and better-than-expected manufacturing performance helped lead the company to greater than 20 percent revenue growth vs. the second quarter of last year," Craig Barrett, Intel's CEO, said in a prepared statement. "We saw strong demand in all business groups, especially for microprocessors, flash memory and networking silicon." Nonetheless, all was not good news. The company said it expects to start recording revenue for its upcoming Itanium chip in the fourth quarter, rather than the third as previously stated. Effectively, this represents a delay in the release. Rambus Questions Intel also opened the door to speculation that Rambus may not be the only memory matched with the upcoming Pentium 4. Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel Architecture Group, stated that Pentium 4 computers will intially be matched with Rambus memory, otherwise known as RDRAM. "Our road map is RDRAM," he said. However, he added that the company may begin to look at other types of less expensive memory when the Pentium 4 becomes more widely used. "We have a number of options as we look at other price points," he said. At another point in the conference call, he stated "We still view this memory technology as delivering the best overall performance...but this is not to say that we won't have other memory configurations to take advantage of other price points." The statements are interesting in that, until today, Intel has only mentioned Rambus, which is more expensive than other memory designs, in conjunction with the Pentium 4. The Pentium 4 goes into volume production in the second half of the year, he said. The chips initially will be incorporated into high-end computers. On other product issues, Otellini said it is likely the Pentium 4, Pentium III and Celeron chips will all coexist and be sold by Intel through 2001.
2006-03-07 - Intel shows Origami-like device    SAN FRANCISCO--Intel on Tuesday plans to show off the minitablet device at the center of Microsoft's Origami project. In a preview of Tuesday afternoon's demonstration, Intel Marketing Director Brad Graff showed CNET News.com several of the ultramobile PC devices, including an example of the kind of hardware that will ship in the next few weeks as part of the Microsoft effort. As earlier reported, the first devices have a 7-inch touch screen, standard x86 processors, and can run full versions of desktop operating systems including the Windows XP variant being used for Origami. In later generations, probably next year or later, the devices could have the pocket size, all-day battery life, and $500 price that Microsoft and Intel are aiming for, Graff said in an interview. The first generation of devices are likely to get about three hours of battery life, he said. In addition to the 7-inch model, Graff showed several other prototype devices of what the chipmaker hopes will be possible in future versions, including models with smaller screens and a swivel-out keyboard. Although the prototypes are working, because they use today's standard components, they get only about 15 minutes of battery life. Video: Sneak peak of small things to come Ultramobile PCs come fully equipped. Intel's hardware, which uses its ultralow-voltage chips, can run standard x86 operating systems, including Windows and Linux. Microsoft plans on Thursday to finally detail its Origami effort, which runs only on Windows XP. Both Microsoft and Intel have been targeting the affordable, ultraportable laptops market for some time. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates showed off a prototype of such a device at last year's Windows Hardware Engineering Conference in Seattle. Intel has been touting the ultramobile PC idea as well. Intel and Microsoft's latest efforts are not the first stab at shrinking the PC. There has long been a class of ultraportable laptops, mostly with around 10-inch screens. There have been a few prior attempts to take the PC even smaller, most notably from OQO and a minitablet introduced this year by Dualcor Technologies. Most of these devices, though, have been priced at about $1,500, which is above the budgets of the average consumer. The key feature of the new devices, Graff said, is the ability to get the full Internet, with plug-ins and other advanced Web features. Entertainment--including music, movies and TV--is probably the second biggest selling point, he said. Although Intel has consumers in mind for the ultramobile PCs, Graff said he expects technology enthusiasts, as well as some niche business and education customers, to be the most likely buyers of the first generation of devices, which will sell for under $1,000. "We expect this to be a real consumer product and to do that, you have to be able to hit real consumer price points," he said. Intel also found in its testing that the devices appeal to active mothers, who, the chipmaker learned, have schedules similar to corporate road warriors. "It was something we didn't expect," Graff said.
2006-08-16 - Intel shows off new 'Tulsa' Xeon   SAN FRANCISCO--Intel and Dell this week showed off servers using the chipmaker's forthcoming high-end "Tulsa" Xeon, a chip that Intel has begun shipping but not formally announced. The chips were used in an unlabeled Intel server and a Dell PowerEdge 6850 on display here at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo. Linux is popular chiefly on servers, so Intel, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Advanced Micro Devices and others with server products are prime sponsors of the show. Tulsa, a dual-core processor, is the last of the ill-fated NetBurst lineage of x86 chips from Intel. The NetBurst design in recent years was more notable for increases in power consumption than in performance, but it's now been largely replaced by the Core microarchitecture that performs better and uses less electricity. Intel released a Core-based Xeon called Woodcrest in June, but that processor is used only in dual-processor servers. Tulsa is for more powerful four-processor machines. Intel's NetBurst fumble left room for rival AMD to enter the x86 server market that Intel once had to itself. AMD this week announced its new "Rev F" line of dual-core Opteron processors, which in 2007 will be supplanted by quad-core models that plug into the same "Socket F." Intel began shipping Tulsa chips for revenue this quarter, Chief Executive Paul Otellini said in July, bringing the products to market a quarter earlier than planned. Each Tulsa processor core has 1MB of level-two cache memory, and the two cores share a whopping 16MB of level-three cache memory, more than any other x86 processor. Cache memory stores instructions and data so the information can be retrieved more quickly than that in main memory. Tulsa uses 1.3 billion transistors--nearly as many as the 1.6 billion in Intel's new "Montecito" version of the Itanium processor, said Radhika Kunte, an Intel representative at the show. Intel can afford to build large caches better than its rivals, because it has moved more quickly to a new manufacturing process with 65-nanometer circuitry elements, letting more transistors be crammed into a given surface area. Most rivals still are building chips with a 90-nanometer process. The processor runs at a top speed of 3.4GHz, according to an Intel presentation at the show. Tulsa comes in two variants: one high-performance model that consumes 150 watts of power and one geared for rack-mounted servers that consumes 95 watts. Tulsa chips fit into servers using Intel's "Truland" platform, a server design that also accommodates the single-core "Potomac" Xeon processors introduced in early 2005 and the dual-core "Paxville" models introduced in late 2005. Compared with Paxville, Tulsa boosts transaction processing performance by a factor of 1.7, enterprise resource planning software by a factor of 1.4, and e-commerce software by a factor of 2, Intel said.
2002-04-18 - Intel shows off new mobile chips   SEATTLE--Intel has produced its first prototypes of the upcoming "Banias" processor, the company's first chip purely designed for use in mobile PCs, the company announced at WinHEC on Thursday. Intel Labs produced the first test version of the chip during the past week, Intel President Paul Otellini said in a speech at the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference. Banias systems, including Intel's Odem chipset, will come out in early 2003 and feature 802.11b "Wi-Fi" wireless networking, long battery life and uncompromised performance, he said. "It is the first bottom-up product designed for notebook computers that does not compromise performance," Otellini said. Banias is an "entirely new micro architecture" employing different circuitry, Otellini said in an interview after the speech. The system's 802.11 support initially will come with separate chips, but those will gradually be integrated with the other chipset components, he said. Banias will compete with new processors from Advanced Micro Devices and Transmeta, which have energized the market for laptops with chips that consume less power. Banias can run the same software programs as the Pentium 4 or Pentium III, but from a design perspective, it differs from those chips. To cut energy consumption, Banias automatically shuts off its different subcomponents when not in use. Although it's designed for notebooks, the chip will also appear in thin "blade" servers. Banias isn't the only chip fresh out of Intel. Otellini showed off a silicon wafer with "Madison" chips, the third generation of its top-end 64-bit Itanium family. "This is one of the first Madison wafers. We've had this silicon for about a week," Otellini said. Intel did not demonstrate Madison working in an actual computer or disclose when the chip would be delivered. The chip will be based on the same designs as McKinley, a new version of Itanium coming this quarter, but it will have 6MB of high-speed "cache" memory built in. Intel spokesman Seth Walker said the chip is due in 2003. McKinley, which Otellini said will go into production "midyear," is built on a 180-nanometer process and has about 220 million transistors. Madison is built on a 130-nanometer process and has about 500 million transistors, he said. Otellini also said that Intel's hyper-threading technology, which lets a single processor act in some ways like two, will debut in desktop Pentium 4 systems in 2003. Hyper-threading currently is available only on Intel's top-end Xeon version of the Pentium 4 and is enabled in servers but not workstations. The technology allows two different applications to use different components of a microprocessor simultaneously. For the first time publicly, Intel demonstrated Pentium 4-based desktop computers with hyper-threading, showing air-cooled systems with 3GHz processors running Microsoft video encoding and decoding software. The hyper-threading-enabled system runs about 20 percent faster than its comrade, according to Otellini. Intel, which has acquired several communications chip companies in recent years, says it believes the computing and communication industries will converge in coming years. Boosting this trend in 2003 will be a new chip from Intel that combines newer "2.5G" GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) cell phone communication abilities, memory, and a central processing unit that can run Microsoft's Windows CE .Net operating system, the company said. The phone chip will combine an XScale processor, Intel's StratFlash flash memory, and its MicroSignal digital signal processor, Otellini said. It's planned to be in phones by 2003. The 2.5G phones, which provide faster networking speeds than the second-generation, or 2G, phones in widespread use today, are still in their nascent phases of adoption, Otellini said. "We're aiming ahead of the curve in terms of where the market is going," Otellini said. Intel is engaged in an arms race with Texas Instruments, Motorola and others to become the dominant power for chips in cell phones and handhelds. Both TI and Motorola have far longer histories than Intel in this business, but Intel claims that its extensive manufacturing expertise and strength, not to mention its huge flash memory business, will work to its advantage.
1999-12-07 - Intel shipping prototype Itanium computers Intel has started the next phase of making its upcoming Itanium processor a real product, shipping prototype computers with the chip to hardware and software makers for product design and debugging. Intel has made thousands of the prototype chips and plans to ship hundreds of systems containing the prototypes by year's end to computer makers, said Ron Curry, director of marketing for the new chips. The Itanium, Intel's first 64-bit processor, will compete against high-powered processors such as Sun's UltraSparc III. Intel has found several bugs in the first versions of its Itanium chips, which formerly were known by their code-name Merced. However, there were fewer than expected for a brand-new architecture, Curry said. IBM, Novell, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems had to go to Intel labs to try out the first scant Itanium samples. The bigger issue Itanium faces is how much demand there will be for the new chip. Generally, analysts believe that its number-crunching prowess will make it good for workstations and technical computing, especially the lofty edge of the workstation market that Intel has yet to fully penetrate. Typically conservative business users, however, will mostly likely initially purchase Itanium systems for testing purposes before moving widely to the new chip. The chip has experienced some delays. It is Intel's first 64-bit chip, meaning that it will be able to deal with much larger databases and much larger amounts of memory than today's 32-bit Intel chips. The 64-bit chip family, called IA-64, will also be based around a completely new architecture. "The picture for the launch of Itanium...continues to be murky, although that should not be a surprise given how Intel has struggled with the performance of new product launches in the past," wrote Merrill Lynch analyst Joe Osha in a recent report. "It would be a good idea for investors to throttle their expectations back--the more we talk to Intel about Itanium, the more we are told to save our real performance expectations for the follow-up product, currently code-named McKinley." However, in the long term, Intel's IA-64 effort to carve out a section of the high-end computing market ultimately will succeed, Osha said. "The Itanium is merely a baby step in what we believe will be a successful effort by Intel in the enterprise computing market," he said. Intel will ship thousands of Itanium prototype computers in the first quarter of 2000, Curry said. These computers will go to software writers and manufacturers of devices such as network cards that plug into the computers. "It's unprecedented in the industry to release them this early in the stage of the program and in this quantity," Curry said. The next stage in the schedule is to release prototype systems tuned for high performance in the second quarter, he said. In the second quarter, manufacturers also will begin getting production-grade Itanium chips, so they can start their own qualification testing, he said. Itanium computers for customers then will be available for the general public in the second half of the year, he said. The design philosophy for Itanium initially came from HP, which called the design explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC) and approached Intel to help in design and manufacturing so the chip wouldn't be consigned to low-volume markets. The HP design began in December 1988 in great secrecy, complete with a "black budget," said Dick Lampman, leader of the effort and now director of HP Labs, in an interview last week. HP expected the chip to debut in the mid to late 1990s, he said. "It took a little longer than we thought," he said. "Of course it's frustrating. But maddening? Not really. We think it will prosper in spite of the delays." IA-64 will "transform the industry," Lampman said, because software written for desktop computers will run unmodified on extremely powerful ones as well, bridging the current divide between PCs and servers. Over the last few months, companies such as IBM, HP and Sun announced their success in porting their operating systems to samples of Itanium processors. Microsoft Windows and Linux were the first two types of OSes that successfully ran on the chip. IBM was next, followed by HP, with Sun bringing up the rear. "Sun had a little more trouble than the others," Curry said. Although the difficulty scheduling time on the limited number of prototypes also held things back. The operating system landscape simplified with the decision by Compaq not to translate its Tru64 version of Unix to Itanium and by SGI's decision to use Linux, not its own Irix operating system. In addition, the versions of Unix from IBM, Santa Cruz Operation and Sequent are being rolled into one edition code-named Monterey-64. Also, probably in February, Intel will lift the nondisclosure agreement under which the Trillian project members are working to create a version of Linux for the new chips. Red Hat, the leading Linux seller, recently acquired a place in the Trillian Project through the acquisition of Cygnus Solutions. It's the only Linux seller to have such a position. Intel is working on a new Itanium chip set--the chips that connect the CPU to the rest of the computer--called the 460GX, Curry said. That chipset will come in two configurations, one for two-processor Itanium workstations and one for four-processor servers, he said. Other companies are working on their own chipsets, he added.
2004-01-29 - Intel shifts 64-bit emphasis   Intel plans to demonstrate a 64-bit revamp of its Xeon and Pentium processors in mid-February--an endorsement of a major rival's strategy and a troubling development for Intel's Itanium chip. The demo, which follows the AMD64 approach of Intel foe Advanced Micro Devices, is expected at the Intel developer conference, Feb. 17 through 19 in San Francisco, according to sources familiar with the plan. Intel had code-named the technology Yamhill but now calls it CT, sources said. News.context What's new: Intel plans to demonstrate a 64-bit revamp of its Xeon and Pentium processors in mid-February. Bottom line: Pushing 64-bit capability could help those chips approach the performance of Itanium. But that could leave the future of Itanium, which companies such as HP and Silicon Graphics are counting on, in limbo. More stories on this topic Adding 64-bit features would let "x86" chips such as Intel's Xeon and Pentium overcome today's 4GB memory limit but would undermine the hope that Intel's current 64-bit chip, Itanium, will ever ship in large quantities. A CT demonstration would send the message that prospective Itanium customers should put Itanium purchases on hold, said Peter Glaskowsky, editor in chief of In-Stat/MDR's Microprocessor Report. "If they put all the effort into Xeon they put into Itanium, it could be a very impressive thing. They could get very close to the performance levels of Itanium," Glaskowsky said. But there would be a cost: "In the long run, if they were really serious about x86-64...it would kill Itanium." That would hurt Intel, which has staked much of its reputation on Itanium, but it would affect partners such as Hewlett-Packard and Silicon Graphics moreso; both rely on Itanium for their future server designs. Bill Kircos, an Intel spokesman, declined to comment on the CT name or plan other than to say, "We will include extensions in our chips, if our customers are requesting it and if the infrastructure is available, including a production operating system...tools, software and applications." Kircos also maintained that Itanium "has turned a corner" and is achieving mainstream acceptance in the high-end server market. "The (chief information officers) who buy Itanium are more conservative than Pat Buchanan"--unwilling to make dramatic computing changes overnight. "This is a marathon; not a sprint." The CT name follows a pattern Intel uses to name features the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker is building into its chips: The already released HT, or hyperthreading, technology lets a single chip act in some ways like two; the VT, or "Vanderpool," technology runs multiple operating systems on one chip; and the LT, "LaGrande," security technology. AMD's Opteron is catching on. In the third quarter--only the second since Opteron's April debut--about 10,746 Opteron servers were sold--more than twice the 4,957 Itanium systems, according to market researcher IDC. However, Opteron and Itanium shipments are both far short of selling the 1.18 million servers shipped with Intel's Xeon or Pentium or AMD's Athlon. Major names have joined several second-tier companies to sell Opteron servers, including IBM, Sun Microsystems and, according to sources, soon Hewlett-Packard, too. Itanium was once expected to spread as widely as Pentium, but Itanium forecasts have been declining in recent years. In 2000, IDC projected Itanium server sales of $28 billion by 2004. Two weeks ago, IDC lowered its 2007 forecast to $7.5 billion. The high stakes for Intel have meant close scrutiny of the words of Intel executives. Two weeks ago, Mike Fister, the head of Intel's server group, predicted that lower Itanium prices "could kind of obfuscate" Xeon. But on Wednesday, Intel Chief Operating Officer Paul Otellini boosted the x86-64 direction, saying in a Webcast interview with Schwab Soundview Capital Markets on Wednesday, "You can be fairly confident that when there is software from an application and operating system standpoint, we'll be there." Itanium has been able to run x86 software only very slowly, but Intel says performance is improving, with a software emulation technology called IA-32 Execution Layer. In contrast, AMD's x86-64 approach, now called AMD64, runs the vast quantity of existing software for Pentium and Xeon. An Intel CT demonstration doesn't mean that the technology is ready for mainstream use, however. Analysts believe that as with hyperthreading, Vanderpool and LaGrande, Intel put the technology into chips but is waiting to enable it, until necessary software support catches up. Both Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight64, and Glaskowsky believe that CT was built into an upcoming Pentium 4 version called Prescott, due Feb. 2. That means that CT would also be in Prescott's Xeon derivatives--"Nocona" for dual-processor systems and "Potomac" for those with four or more processors. However, Brookwood believes that Intel will wait for the appearance of Prescott's successor, called Tejas, which is due in early 2005. The reason for the wait, Brookwood believes, is that the Prescott designs were complete before Intel had access to AMD's approach, meaning that software tuned for one wouldn't work on the other. "They need that compatibility now," Brookwood said. "I believe that Tejas is coming so hard on Prescott's heels, (because) Tejas has the compatibility that is not in Prescott and Prescott derivatives." IBM, for one, believes that x86 has a strong future, with plans for a 64-processor server. Because of the Itanium commitment, Intel is currently reluctant to talk about how great CT could make Xeon, Glaskowsky said. "They cannot afford to say that, because they're not sure yet that they want to do this," he said.
2004-11-18 - Intel shifting Itanium 2 focus to higher-end   An effort by Intel to sell its Itanium 2 chip into high-volume, lower-end computer servers has not worked, the president of the world's largest chip maker said in an interview published on Thursday. Itanium, which was jointly developed by Intel and Hewlett-Packard, has not yet found a large following in a server market crowded with competition from chips made by IBM, Sun Microsystems and Advanced Micro Devices. "Itanium is showing success in the high end, not in the mid-range," Intel President Paul Otellini, who was chosen to take over as Intel chief executive next year, said in an interview with BusinessWeek. "It just doesn't work in terms of the economics of the low end of the industry." Otellini said Intel is repositioning Itanium 2 to be designed into higher-end servers and mainframes that do the heavy lifting for corporations and research institutions. Intel's less-expensive Xeon chip, a cousin of the Pentium 4 chip that is used in home computers, remains the company's mainstay for low-end servers. "The mainframe isn't dead. That's where I'd like to push Itanium over time," Otellini said, adding that "we're focusing product development, marketing and software efforts on greater than four-way systems." A four-way system is a server built with four microprocessors. Intel spokesman Robert Manetta said Otellini's comments do not mean that the company is withdrawing Itanium from the lower-end server market. He said Itanium's success has picked up this year, with deployment of Itanium-based servers up as much as 60 percent this year. Story Copyright 2004 Reuters Limited. All rights reserved.
2000-07-05 - Intel shelves 800-MHz Xeon chip    Intel has canceled plans for high-end versions of its 800-MHz Xeon processor, saying computer makers didn't want the chip. The Xeon is Intel's high-end version of its Pentium III. The most expensive Xeons come with 1MB or 2MB of high-speed cache memory built into the chip itself. Intel released 700-MHz versions of these large-cache Xeons in May but decided to skip the 800-MHz version, company spokesman Otto Pijpker said today. Intel customers such as Compaq Computer "asked us to reduce the pace of large-cache processor introductions," Pijpker said. The move had nothing to do with Intel's ability to make the chips, he said. Compaq spokesman Steve Thieme concurred. "Our customers are looking for less frequent updates with larger incremental gains," he said. "We certainly relay our customer requirements to Intel." Indeed, computer makers have a lot of work to do to keep up with Intel's upcoming high-end chip launches for server computers, said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. The Itanium chip, the first in a new family of higher-powered 64-bit chips from Intel, will launch in the next few months at speeds of 800 MHz, with Level 3 cache of 2MB and 4MB, Pijpker said. Foster, a new update to the existing 32-bit chip line and successor to Xeon, will debut in the first quarter of 2001 at speeds greater than 1 GHz, Pijpker added. But even without those new lines, just keeping up with the existing Cascades line of current Pentium III and Xeon chips is difficult, Brookwood said. "Every time Intel comes out with a new speed bump in the current Cascades line, these guys have to stop and qualify not only uniprocessor models, but dual-processor, four-way, eight-way...None of those qualifications is easy work." In an effort to adjust to the different demands of higher-end marketplaces, Intel has been trying to ease back on how fast new chips come out. "For a while we tried really hard to keep up with the desktop space. But the customer feedback was that, in general, they weren't going to introduce servers at the same rate they introduce new PCs," Pijpker said.
2004-03-30 - Intel settles Intergraph suit for 225 million  Intel announced on Tuesday that it will pay $225 million to Intergraph to settle a patent infringement lawsuit over its Itanium chips. The agreement brings to a close all outstanding patent infringement litigation between the two parties, which has cost Intel a total of $675 million in settlement payments. It also reveals an unusual indemnification agreement between Intel and Dell, which also uses the chip giant's microprocessors, motherboards and chipsets and was sued by Intergraph for patent infringement. "We're now done with Intergraph," said Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman. The latest settlement, involving Intel's 64-bit Itanium chip, marks the third one reached with its former rival. In 2001, Intergraph filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court, alleging that Intel's Itanium chip infringed on its defunct Clipper processor patents. Intel lost in the lower courts and agreed to pay Intergraph $150 million to settle some aspects of the case. That followed a $300 million settlement Intel paid Intergraph over a similar lawsuit in 1997, which involved the chip giant's Pentium line. "Today's settlement demonstrates the effectiveness of our intellectual-property licensing and litigation actions to date. We believe this settlement and the related licensing agreements are in the best interests of our shareholders and will allow us to focus on our remaining intellectual property enforcement efforts," Halsey Wise, Intergraph's chief executive, said in a statement. The settlement also resolves the litigation between Intergraph and Dell. In 2002, Intergraph filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas against Dell, Gateway and Hewlett-Packard. The lawsuit centered on allegations the computer makers infringed on its Clipper system patents. Dell later countersued Intel, alleging that the chip giant should also be named as a co-defendant in the case. Dell cited the 2002 settlement agreement reached between Intergraph and Intel and the indemnification that Intel had granted the computer maker. As a result of the recent settlement between Intel and Intergraph, the company will remove Dell as a defendant in the case. However, HP and Gateway were not so lucky and will go to trial in August. Intergraph will also grant Dell a license to all Intergraph-owned patents. Intel declined to give specifics of its indemnification agreement with Dell, other than to note that it indemnifies all its customers and that Dell's agreement was "unique." But, Intel and Dell are at odds over some of the terms in that agreement, according to the chipmaker. "Dell claims (that the agreement) obligates Intel to indemnify the company from patent infringement claims....which relate to combining Intel microprocessors and other components in Dell systems. Intel disagrees with Dell's interpretation of that agreement but has decided to remove the current dispute from the courts and resolve the disagreement privately," Intel said in a statement. The companies will resolve their differences without the aid of a courtroom or administrative law judge, Mulloy said. As a result, the case will no longer be heard in a public court. Under the settlement, Intergraph also agrees not to file a lawsuit against any Intel customer whose products include a combination of an Intel microprocessor, chipset and motherboard.
2006-03-28 - Intel sets up venture fund for Brazil  Intel Capital, the venture arm of chipmaker Intel, has created a venture fund that will invest $50 million in Brazilian start-ups, the latest step in an effort to expand its business in emerging nations. The fund will invest in a variety of companies but pay particular attention to start-ups focusing on wireless technologies such as WiMax, said a spokesman. Intel has already invested about $35 million in 13 Brazilian start-ups, including Digitron, TelecomNet and Certsign. The new fund will thus bring the total invested in Brazil to around $85 million. CEO Paul Otellini is in Brazil for a series of meetings this week. Brazil is part of the so-called BRIC powers, which also include Russia, India and China. These four countries are expected to constitute four of the fastest-growing regional markets and tech centers over the next few decades. But, as one IBM executive said, there is a big difference between the BR and IC parts of the equation, with crime, political instability and other issues hampering the development of indigenous tech industries in Brazil and Russia. Sprinkling venture dollars to jumpstart a new market is a longstanding strategy at Intel. Last year, Craig Barrett popped over to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to announce a $50 million fund concentrating on the Middle East. It also has created funds for India and China. In the past few years, the chipmaker has emerged as one of the largest venture investors in the world. While Intel wants to obtain a financial return on its investment, its venture funds largely exist to help create new products and ultimately spur demand for new PCs or other products containing Intel chips. The company has a large general fund as well as several specialty funds. The success of the specialty funds varies all over the map. For instance, Intel created a fund targeted at companies developing technology for its Itanium processor. After several years, however, Itanium is selling below expectations. In 2005, a now-retired Intel Capital executive said that the company would not likely be placing investments in start-ups in Russia had it foreseen the most recent political scandals. On the other hand, some of Intel's Chinese investments have already held IPOs. Overall, since 1991, 160 of the companies in Intel Capital's portfolio have been acquired while another 150 have gone public.
2003-11-20 - Intel sets the bar at 4GHz Intel is striving to break the 4GHz barrier for its chips. The chipmaker, which discussed its plans in a wide-ranging meeting with financial analysts on Thursday, said it aims to boost the performance of a broad range of its products next year, including cranking up its desktop PC processors. "Our goal is to hit 4GHz in 2004," Intel President Paul Otellini said during a meeting that was Webcast. Intel is aiming to reach that clock speed with Prescott, an upcoming processor for desktop computers that will be built using a 90-nanometer manufacturing process. (A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.) Prescott is scheduled to ship this quarter to PC makers, Otellini said. But it's not expected to come in desktop PCs until early next year. Right now, Intel's fastest chip is the 3.2GHz Pentium 4. While a 4GHz processor may seem fast, as least one analyst said the jump isn't a particularly large one for a brand-new processor. "I would be really surprised if Intel didn't hit 4GHz in 2004. But don't dismiss the possibility it could blow by that mark," Mercury Research analyst Dean McCarron said. Opinions on the importance of raw processor clock speed differ. Where Intel has always emphasized the speed of its high-end desktop processors--saying the Pentium 4's extra speed helps boost the performance of multimedia applications--other chipmakers, like rival Advanced Micro Devices, maintain that overall performance, measured by the work a chip can accomplish per clock cycle, is more important. The Athlon FX-51 chip is currently AMD's fastest chip, at 2.2GHz. Intel also plans to increase production of Prescott processors quickly enough to ship 70 million of them in 2004, Otellini said. The chipmaker expects that Prescott processors will be found in 60 percent of performance desktop PCs sold in 2004, while a Celeron derivative of the chip will garner 40 percent of lower-priced desktop machines, Otellini said. Processor plans In a break from its strategy in previous transitions to new desktop processors, Intel is expected to release the Celeron version of Prescott quickly, one source said. Although Prescott is Intel's biggest planned release for 2004, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company plans to deliver a wide range of new chips during the year. One will be a 90-nanometer processor for notebooks called Dothan. Dothan, in combination with a new tri-band wireless module and a new chipset, will improve the performance of Intel's Centrino package for wireless notebooks, Otellini said. Intel also plans to add a low-power Wi-Fi chip for cell phones and PDAs (personal digital assistants) to its wireless chip lineup and to release a chipset that is designed to turn desktop PCs into Wi-Fi access points. The products are designed to enhance the running of devices such as PCs, handhelds, and even consumer electronics devices for the home, Otellini said. Otellini also disclosed that Intel will ship 100,000 Itanium chips in 2003, a figure that the company says is higher than most industry expectations. Emerging geographical markets present a huge opportunity for the chipmaker, Intel CEO Craig Barrett said during the meeting. He likened Intel's efforts to expand into international markets to similar initiatives by beverage giant Coca-Cola, which uses a blanket advertising campaign in target countries. "We're going to try to do the same thing with Intel--and 'Intel Inside'--going forward. We'll be very heavily involved in emerging markets to promote the sale and distribution of our products," he said. The chipmaker will see about half of its sales from growing markets such as China in the future, Barrett said. But to keep up with rivals, the company will keep investing in existing markets, such as the United States, which represents about 30 percent of Intel's business and is the company's single largest market. The result of all of technology investment will be a continuing cycle of technological one-upmanship among companies, governments and even consumers that will benefit Intel, Barrett said. But Intel is still reluctant to say there's an upturn coming in business spending on PCs. Though Barrett noted that the Semiconductor Industry Association has forecast near 20 percent growth in semiconductor revenue in 2004, and though he reiterated Intel's optimistic fourth-quarter outlook, he said that Intel has seen few signs of a recovery in spending by businesses in the United States. "We're seeing some sprinkling signs of that," he said. "But I don't expect to see a major upgrade cycle."
2001-05-25 - Intel set to rattle server market with Itanium At long last, Intel will lift the veil of silence next week from its Itanium chip, setting off a new round of competition in the market for servers and advanced workstation PCs. Curtain rises on Itanium serversMark Hudson, manager, Hewlett-Packard Intel on Tuesday will announce that it has started shipping of production versions of the 64-bit chip, according to sources familiar with Intel's plans. Itanium workstations and servers will begin hitting the market as soon as next month, the sources said. Itanium is the first step in Intel's effort to shake up the market for high-end servers, currently dominated by Sun Microsystems, which uses its own expensive Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) chips. Itanium machines are expected to cost considerably less than traditional Unix servers sold by Sun and others, giving the chip giant a wedge to get businesses to switch. Intel, which requires computer makers to adhere to a web of stringent nondisclosure agreements on "unannounced" products, will lift those restrictions pertaining to Itanium products on Tuesday, the sources said. Once the curtain comes up, a number of PC makers, including Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard, will engage in an Itanium free-for-all to show support for the chip. HP will, for example, ship three new Itanium products--a workstation and two servers--in the near future. Dell already announced plans to begin selling its first Itanium server this summer. To date, the chipmaker, through sampling and pilot programs, has shipped about 40,000 Itanium chips. Initially, Intel expects eight to 10 PC makers to announce products based on the chip. It also expects 20 to 60 applications. Currently, Itanium will work with seven operating systems, including the HP-UX and IBM's AIX-5L versions of Unix, Microsoft's Windows and 64-bit versions of Linux from Red Hat, Caldera, SuSE and TurboLinux. Over the course of the year, Intel expects another 15 computer manufacturers to pick up Itanium, for a total of 25 companies shipping about 35 models. Over the course of the year, Intel expects developers to announce many more applications, for a total of about 400, an Intel representative said. Picking up the chip HP, for example, will ship three new products in the near future, including a dual-processor i2000 workstation and four- and 16-processor models of the HP Server rx, said Mark Hudson, worldwide marketing manager for HP servers. Meanwhile, Dell has said it will begin selling its first Itanium server this summer. IBM is expected to ship one server and one Intellistation workstation fitted with Itanium. Compaq and Gateway are also expected to ship Itanium servers. The new machines will cost more than servers using Intel's current Pentium III Xeon chip. However, Intel insists customers who budget for the extra cost over and above a Pentium III system will receive added performance and reliability. Analysts say that despite multiple delays, Itanium has aged well for the most part. "Given how late the chip is, its performance, especially on technical applications, is still pretty impressive," said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at researcher Insight 64. The chip will provide the largest performance increases for floating point-intensive applications, such as graphic art programs and computer-aided design, he said. Meanwhile, when it comes to other applications, "Intel does have some room for improvement," Brookwood said. Itanium systems are expected to cost less than traditional Unix servers or workstations, including those based on RISC chips, such as on HP's PA-RISC or Sun Microsystems' UltraSPARC III-based Sun Fire servers and Sun Blade workstations. Initial price lists indicated that the chip would range in cost from $4,227 for an 800MHz Itanium with 4MB of performance-enhancing tertiary cache memory to over $3,500 for a 733MHz Itanium with 2MB of tertiary cache. While the 4MB version will cost the same, the lower-end models will cost less. For workstations, Itaniums running at 733MHz and containing 2MB of cache memory will sell for between $1,000 and $2,000, or in the range of Intel's current Xeon chips. Judging by Intel's pricing history, the 800MHz Itanium with 2MB cache will likely have a similar price. Making accommodations Analysts believe Itanium will cause companies that sell RISC/Unix workstations and servers to readjust their product lines. For HP, IBM and Compaq, all of which offer both Intel and RISC-based workstations and servers, this will require product line juggling. However, Sun and other RISC-only server makers might have to cook up lower-priced offerings. Otherwise, "they're going to find they're going to lose a lot of low-end business to these Itanium boxes," Brookwood said. Many factors make Itanium different from the Pentiums that came before. Itanium was designed to address a larger amount of memory, which helps to speed applications such as databases, and also to perform more work per clock cycle than a standard Intel chip, such as the Pentium 4. Itanium does this extra work by dividing and processing larger chunks of data in parallel. Adding performance with new features that increase reliability, Intel says, will decrease the cost of maintaining servers and workstations. The added bang for the buck could shake things up in the server market, though a massive initial impact from Itanium is unlikely, given the typical reluctance of companies to adopt new and unproven technologies. Instead, Itanium's early adopters will likely be a small number of companies that are after immediate performance gains. These customers, which include Motorola, Wells Fargo and Lycos, are likely to be running Web security applications, mining data, maintaining large databases or doing scientific computing. Intel maintains that for applications such as scientific computing, the chip can "bring the economics of IA (Intel architecture) with the performance of what you've seen in supercomputers," said Lisa Hambrick, director of marketing for the Itanium processor family at Intel. "I certainly think that end users who wants that capability will deploy it right away." She acknowledged that for other market segments, Itanium will take longer to get rolling. "But they will grow more over time," she said. "It's not like a desktop launch where everything goes on Day 1." HP's server business sees the new chip creating its own economy. Its introduction gives HP the opportunity to offer services such as consulting to customers releasing new servers based on the new chip. Over a period of as many as five years, HP executives said, the company will be able to consolidate its servers on Itanium, which will help it to reduce costs. Generations to come For Intel, the chip is the beginning of what it hopes will be a long-running family of workstation and server chips. Though work continues on future versions of the chip, it's also the end of a protracted initial development process. Many people at Intel, and co-developer HP, will breathe a sigh of relief when the curtain raises on the chip, which has been more than seven years in the making. "Just like any new technology, it's going to take several years to establish (itself) in the market," said HP's Hudson. "The first generation will be...targeted at early adopters." Brookwood agreed. "I think it's going to take another six to 12 months before people begin ordering these" in any kind of numbers, he said. "I think McKinley (a follow-on version of the first Itanium) is going to be the volume play." Intel spins it a little differently. Instead of acting as a stepping-stone for faster, future versions of the Itanium, this first chip will create a foundation for 64-bit computing, an Intel representative said. Though even higher-performing chips will follow, including McKinley and other new versions code-named Madison and Deerfield, still others wait in the wings. Intel plans to ship pilot versions of its McKinley chip at the end of the year, with the first production systems coming in 2002. That chip is expected to debut at gigahertz or higher speeds. After the launch of the first chip, which had been known by the code name Merced, Intel says the Itanium family should continue to evolve for up to 25 years.
2003-02-19 - Intel set to expand server offers  SAN JOSE, Calif.--Intel plans to come out with server chips tailored for every taste and budget in 2003, as part of its effort to take more market share from other chipmakers such as Sun Microsystems and IBM. For example, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is set to increase the processor speed, bus speed and cache size of its existing Xeon processors for servers and workstations during the course of the year. It also is readying entirely new chips, called Nocona and Potomac, based on a chip design that will also be shared by desktop chip Prescott, due out in the middle of the year. Nocona is scheduled to arrive late this year or early next year, and Potomac in 2004. This summer, the company plans to release Madison, the next version of the Itanium 2 chip. It will follow that release in the second half of the year with Deerfield, an energy-efficient and comparatively inexpensive version of Itanium 2 for blade and rack servers. The server onslaught comes during what could be a historic year for the server market. Although more servers containing Intel chips are shipped each year than servers containing RISC (reduced instruction set computing) chips, RISC-based servers have always accounted for more revenue. This year, however, research firm Gartner has predicted that revenue from Intel-based servers could pass the 50 percent mark. To help prove that prediction correct, Intel is looking at ways to put its manufacturing muscle to good effect, said Lisa Graff, the company's director of enterprise processor marketing. One example: In the third quarter, the company will come out with a Xeon for one- and two-processor servers containing 1MB of cache (a pool of data in the processor designed to allow rapid data access). The product had been scheduled for next year. "We have a lot of flexibility to accelerate our road map," Graff said. For some applications, she added, "cache has a bigger impact than clock speed." The company will also continue trying to persuade RISC makers to adopt its chips. "We've been trying to get design wins at Sun for 20 years," said Intel CEO Craig Barrett. How and where these chips eventually get introduced largely depends upon circumstances, Graff said. Intel's most popular server chip family remains the Xeon line, which is based on essentially the same architecture as the Pentium 4 desktop line. Xeon servers are being purchased to handle a wide variety of functions. Pixar Animation Studios, for instance, recently replaced its Sun servers with eight Xeon blade servers from RackSaver. Itanium has proved to be less popular with buyers, but momentum is growing, Graff said, in part because of strong benchmark scores. "We're way ahead of the RISC guys" on benchmarks, she said. Corporate customers with customized applications that need to replace aging RISC systems are increasingly looking at Itanium, analysts say. "We expect to see that there was an uptick in volume shipments of Itanium in the fourth quarter," said Jean Bozman, research analyst at IDC. Deerfield is expected to expand the opportunity for Itanium. Right now, a substantial number of Itanium chips are sold into fairly expensive servers that cost $10,000 or more. Deerfield will be aimed at servers that cost $5,000 to $7,000. Other highlights from Intel's product plans: One- and two-processor systems: The company will release a Xeon with a 533MHz bus and 512KB cache in the first half. Current Xeons in this class come with a 400MHz bus. In the second half, the cache will be boosted to 1MB. "Canterwood," a chipset for these servers, will debut in the middle of the year. By the end of the year or in early 2004, Intel will come out with Nocona, a new chip based on the same design as Prescott. Nocona will be made on the 90-nanometer manufacturing process and run at a faster clock speed, but contain the same level of cache. Nocona may also come with LaGrande, a security technology inside Prescott for preventing outsiders from snooping in hard drives. A chipset code-named Lindenhurst will accompany Nocona. Multiprocessor servers: Gallatin, a Xeon for four- and eight-processor servers that comes with 2MB of cache and runs at 2GHz, came out at the end of last year. In 2003, the company will speed the chip past 2GHz. Late this year or early next year, it will then release a version of Gallatin with 4MB of cache. Later in 2004, the company will follow up with Potomac, a version of Nocona for four-processor servers, as well as a corresponding chipset code-named Twin Castle. Itanium: The showcase version of Madison, which comes out this summer, will run at 1.5GHz and come with 6MB of level three cache. Less-expensive versions will come with 4MB or 3MB of cache and run at slower speeds. Madison will be marketed under the Itanium 2 name. In the second half of the year, Intel will follow up with Deerfield. Officially called LV Itanium 2, the chip will run at 1GHz and contain only 1.5MB of cache. The lower clock speed and smaller cache, however, will let the chip run on far less energy. At a maximum, Deerfield will consume 62 watts of power, compared with current Itanium 2 chips, which take 130 watts. Overall, the chip is expected to perform about as well as current Itanium 2 chips. Along with making server chips, Intel will also manufacture Itanium 2 servers to help jump-start the market. Companies such as Dell Computer, China's Legend and Kraftway (Russia's leading PC maker) already sell Intel-manufactured Itanium servers. A two-processor server based on Madison will come out at the same time as that chip, Graff said.
2006-09-08 - Intel server revamp to follow AMD  Intel is getting ready to introduce a chip communications technology that mirrors an approach central to recent successes of rival Advanced Micro Devices. If Intel's newly competitive chips recently brought to market act as the brains of a server, then the Common System Interface (CSI) is its nervous system. The technology, set for release in 2008, provides a new way for processors to communicate with each other and with the rest of a computer. And alongside CSI, Intel plans to release an integrated memory controller, which is housed on the main processor rather than on a separate supporting chip. This will speed memory performance and so dovetail with the new communications system, the company expects. Together, they could help Intel provide a much-needed counterpunch to AMD, which in 2003 introduced an integrated memory controller and a high-speed interconnect called HyperTransport in its Opteron and Athlon 64 processors. The two communication technologies, marketed together as "Direct Connect Architecture," deliver lower processor costs and chip performance advantages, which AMD has used to win a place in the designs of all of the big four server makers. "Intel is hoping CSI will do for them in servers what 'CSI' did for CBS in ratings," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood, referring to the hit TV series "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation." Intel has been tight-lipped about CSI. However, Tom Kilroy, general manager of the company's Digital Enterprise Group, did confirm some details in a recent CNET News.com interview. Further glimpses have come from server makers, who are eager for CSI's debut in the "Tukwila" Itanium chip, due in 2008. Tracking CSI CSI brings two major changes. First, it will boost processor performance compared with Intel's current chip communication technology, the front-side bus. "From a pure performance perspective, when we get to Tukwila and CSI, and we actually get some of the benefits of that protocol introduced into our systems, I think it's going to be really a big deal," said Rich Marcello, general manager of HP's Business Critical Server group. CSI will be instrumental in helping double the performance of the Tukwila generation of servers, he noted. Second, CSI will help Itanium server designers take advantage of mainstream Xeon server technology. Both chip families will use the interface, Kilroy said. That's particularly useful for companies such as Unisys, whose servers can use both processor types. It will make it possible for elements of a design to be used in both kinds of machine, reducing development costs and speeding development times. "CSI allows us to continue to consolidate and standardize on fewer technologies," said Mark Feverston, Unisys' director of enterprise servers. "We can now go to a more common platform that allows us to build the same solutions in a more economical fashion." CSI hasn't been easy to bring to market, though. In 2005, Intel dramatically altered the schedule for its introduction. Initially, the plan was for it to debut in 2007 with the Tukwila Itanium processor and the high-end "Whitefield" Xeon. But in October, Intel delayed Tukwila to 2008 and canceled Whitefield. "Intel is hoping CSI will do for them in servers what 'CSI' did for CBS in ratings." --Nathan Brookwood, analyst, Insight 64 Whitefield's replacement "Tigerton," and a sequel called "Dunnington," both use the front-side bus for communications. That means CSI won't arrive in high-end Xeons until 2009. In the meantime, Intel has used other methods to compete with AMD--speeding up the front-side bus and building in large amounts of cache memory, for example. "We've taken a different road, but down the road we'll end up getting an integrated memory controller and CSI in our platform," Kilroy said. "It's just a matter of priority for us." Why add CSI? Memory communication speed is a major factor in computer design today. In particular, its increasing performance sluggishness compared with processors is causing problems. To compensate, computer designers have put special high-speed memory, called "cache," directly on the processor. But in multiprocessor systems, cache poses a problem. If one processor changes a cache memory entry, but that change isn't reflected in the main memory, there's a risk that another processor might retrieve out-of-date information from that main memory. To keep caches synchronized--a requirement called "cache coherency"--processors must keep abreast of changes other processors make. With Intel's current designs, an extra chip called the chipset coordinates such communications between processors via the front-side bus. In contrast, with HyperTransport and CSI, the processors communicate directly with each other. Intel also relies on the chipset to help with the communication between chips and the main memory. But technology such as CSI makes it easier for processors to communicate directly with memory. That's because one processor can quickly retrieve data stored in memory connected to another chip. "The biggest advantage CSI offers is performance and the fact that you basically get a direct connection between the processors. That results in reduced latency between the processors," said Craig Church, Unisys's director of server development. The integrated memory controllers, too, will reduce latency, or communication delays, when a chip is fetching data from its own memory, he added. AMD has adopted the integrated memory controller in all its x86 chips, but it's not alone in endorsing the approach. IBM's Power and Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc, which compete with Intel's server line, have had integrated memory controllers for years. With a chipset controlling memory instead of the main processor, "You basically have this middleman, and that introduces a significant amount of latency in the memory transaction," said Mercury Research analyst Dean McCarron. An integrated memory controller not only lets main memory respond faster, it also allows cache sizes, and therefore chip-manufacturing expenses, to be reduced. Indeed, smaller cache sizes have helped AMD remain competitive with Intel, even though it's about a year behind in its transition to more advanced manufacturing with smaller circuitry elements. Intel defends its decision to stick with the front-side bus as long as it has, arguing that the choice has given it flexibility in memory standards and that it's been able to compensate elsewhere to keep up with performance. "Our competition had to go to an integrated memory controller because they can't get the same...amount of cache on a die as we can," Kilroy said. "And we've been able to scale the front-side bus far greater than ever thought. We're now at 1333MHz. The speculation was that we wouldn't be able to scale to that." Lowering design barriers CSI is designed to lower hardware barriers, making it less expensive for server makers to design servers using both chips. Indeed, the word "common" refers to the fact that Itanium and Xeon use the interface. With CSI, a server could be designed to be totally "plug-compatible," meaning the chips would be interchangeable, Church said. "From a Unisys perspective, if a customer wants an Itanium system, we take an Itanium processor and plug it into our common platform. If they want Xeon, we plug a Xeon into our common platform," he said. "That essentially is the nirvana, and it is the goal." Nevertheless, server makers are faced with some differences in CSI for Xeon and Itanium, Marcello said. "The CSI implementations are 95 percent the same, but there's a little bit of difference there. For that reason, we'll be close but not exactly the same," he said. However, they will be similar enough that some joint design work can be shared, he added. Keeping up with the Joneses Once Intel matches AMD's chip communication technologies, it will become a better competitor, Brookwood said. "The big issue for Intel is moving from the front-side bus architecture to more of a distributed architecture," Brookwood said. "Once they get that in place and have workable schemes for managing cache coherency and memory access across processors, then they will be well-positioned to compete on almost any basis with what AMD has been doing. The Direct Connect architecture has been AMD's not-so-secret sauce for the last four years." But AMD has plans of its own. In 2007, it will move to HyperTransport 3.0. The update increases communication speeds and enables construction of 16-processor servers instead of the eight-processor machines that HyperTransport currently permits, said Marty Seyer, a vice president in AMD's commercial business unit. In addition, the company believes the openness of HyperTransport is an advantage. The technology is governed and licensed by the HyperTransport Consortium. One company very interested in HyperTransport's openness is Cray. "It's a huge benefit," said Jan Silverman, senior vice president of corporate strategy at the supercomputer maker. "It's not free, but the terms are much more palatable than anything that I have seen from Intel in the past." The openness also means Cray can use HyperTransport to connect Opteron chips to its own networking chips. And when it wants to use HyperTransport to plug calculation acceleration engines into a computer, it can buy them from a company called DRC Computer that specializes in the engines, instead of having to make its own. AMD's Opteron years have left an impression on Silverman that Intel will have to work hard to reverse. "There was a point in time when Intel used to lead the industry. Now they're following AMD on 64 bits, following on dual-core, following on low-power consumption chips, and now they're going to follow AMD in exposing their Intel architecture," Silverman said.
2002-09-10 - Intel sees dual-core Itanium by 2005   SAN JOSE, Calif.--Intel plans to cross an important technology threshold midway through the decade by squeezing two Itanium chips onto a single slice of silicon. On higher-end networked server computers, two or more processors often share computing tasks. With chip manufacturing advances, Complete coverage Intel Developer Forum news Read what visionaries at the confab expect for wireless, security chipmakers can unite pairs of processors so they're etched onto a single slice of silicon, making the chips less expensive and therefore more competitive. "The middle of the decade is when we'll do that," said Mike Fister, general manager of Intel's Enterprise Platforms Group, at a news conference at the Intel Developer Forum here on Tuesday. Intel will make the move either using its next-generation manufacturing process, which can create circuitry with 90-nanometer features, or using the 65-nanometer generation after that, Fister said. So far, only IBM sells servers with these "dual-core" chips, but Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard are working on their own designs, expected as soon as next year. Intel's Itanium, a brand-new design requiring different software than that used with its Pentium and Xeon chips, is designed to compete with these server chips. The 64-bit chip is used mainly in high-end servers that typically run four or more processors. Dual-core designs could help Intel lower Itanium's price tag enough so that it becomes appropriate for cost-conscious markets, where server sales are currently high, said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. "Right now, Itanium is stuck in a relatively low-volume niche. The challenge for Intel is how to migrate Itanium down into all but maybe the $2,000-to-$3,000 price bands," Brookwood said. "A dual-core chip could help them do that." With each new manufacturing-process generation, circuitry becomes smaller, and more tiny computing switches, called transistors, can be fitted on a single silicon chip. Chip designers face the job of finding the best use for all the new transistors at their disposal, and building dual-core processors is one route. The bigger the processor, the later the transition to dual-core chips can be made. Itanium, at about 400 to 450 square millimeters in size, "is about as big a chip as anybody's ever manufactured," Brookwood said. Itanium 2 currently is built on a 180-nanometer process, but the third-generation "Madison" chip will be built on a 130-nanometer process and thus will shrink to about 200 to 300 square millimeters, Brookwood said. With 90-nanometer manufacturing, an Itanium would be about 150 square millimeters, Brookwood said, so a dual-core Itanium would be roughly 300 square millimeters, a practical size. Madison is scheduled to arrive in the summer of 2003, said Mike Graf, product line manager for Itanium. In branding strategy, Intel will re-use the Itanium 2 name for Madison, though with some variation so it can be distinguished from the current "McKinley" generation. Intel decided to use the same name because Madison chips can be plugged into the exact same computers that use today's Itanium 2 systems, he said. Intel is preparing a lower-end Itanium 2 as well, code-named Deerfield. Deerfield will be designed to consume less power, thereby generating less waste heat and becoming better suited to smaller servers. Fister said Deerfield will consume between 70 and 80 watts, a little more than the 60 to 70 watts of Pentium processors but significantly less than the 120 watts typically used by today's Itanium 2.
2002-05-29 - Intel sees double with Itanium 2   Intel says its new Itanium 2 server chip will live up to its name by providing twice the performance of the current Itanium. The company on Wednesday released test results for its prototype Itanium 2 chips. But though the tests show promise, only time will prove whether the extra performance will be enough to lift the chip into the spot Intel has envisioned for it: the heart of high-end business servers everywhere. Intel designed the 64-bit Itanium architecture from scratch as a way to provide a high-performance chip for large servers that churn data from large databases and Web sites and also act as the heart of large supercomputers. The chip, introduced in May 2001, contains a new architecture that processes data in 64-bit chunks, rather than the 32 bits processed by standard Intel chips. The 64-bit addressing lets the chip handle much larger amounts of data than a typical 32-bit PC processor. But as a result, computer makers must design entirely new computers for the chip, and software developers must spend time and effort making their existing operating systems and applications compatible. To date, Itanium has enjoyed only limited acceptance by computer manufacturers, which shipped only around 2,600 Itanium systems in the third quarter of last year, the first full three-month period in which the chip was available, according to Dataquest. However, Intel believes that Itanium 2, formerly known as McKinley, will change Itanium's fortunes. It offers the performance test results to help prove the point. Time trials The Itanium 2 chip, which will ship in the middle of this year, will offer higher clock speed and other performance improvements over its predecessor. Those improvements include a new on-chip data cache for storing frequently accessed data closer to the chip for quicker access; a faster bus for transferring data between the chip and memory; and greater parallelism. Parallelism is the ability to process multiple bits of data simultaneously. It's a technique used to improve performance of a chip by allowing it to do more work per clock cycle. Intel said that tests of prototype 1GHz Itanium 2 chips show that the improvements help the new chip deliver twice the performance of an 800MHz Itanium on tests such as Standard Performance Evaluation Corp.'s SPECint2000 and SPECfp2000, Intel said. The SPEC tests measure a computer's processor, memory and software performance. Additional tests, Intel said, show that the Itanium 2 can process transactions more quickly, conduct database searches in less time and tackle complex mathematical equations, solving them sooner than chips from competitors. Intel claims a performance advantage over Sun Microsystems' UltraSPARC III, for example. Intel said that a four-processor 1GHz Itanium 2 system processed online transactions 50 percent faster than a comparable Sun server with four 1.05GHz UltraSPARC III chips in tests conducted by Intel engineers. The same four-processor Itanium 2 delivered 13 gigaflops--that is, 13 billion calculations per second--6 more gigaflops than a similarly configured Sun server with 1.05GHz UltraSPARC III processors when tested on the Linpack 10K benchmark test, a test designed to estimate the performance of supercomputers. However, Intel uses its own estimate for the performance of the 1.05GHz UltraSPARC III in both tests. Gartner analyst Martin Reynolds says as Itanium advances in its abilities, it will sweep more applications into its fold. see commentary While some tests show that Itanium 2 prototypes perform better than current 800MHz Itanium chips, and Intel claims better performance than Sun, the ultimate destiny of the Itanium 2 is yet to be determined. Though it's widely accepted that most manufacturers and corporate customers have been holding off buying Itanium servers while awaiting Itanium 2, it won't be until the end of the year or possibly next year before Intel determines if they were willing to keep their word. Some analysts have said that the boost in performance will improve Itanium sales. Kevin Krewell, an editor at the Microprocessor Report newsletter, for instance, said last year that Intel will likely ship 100,000 or more Itanium 2 chips per quarter by the end of this year, a huge increase over early sales of Itanium chips. Meanwhile, large manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard have also recommitted to the chip. HP said recently that it will consolidate its high-end servers from three platforms--Intel Itanium, Compaq Alpha and its own PA-RISC chip--to one Itanium platform over time. IBM has also said it will offer Itanium 2 servers in its xSeries server line. These moves alone could give the chip a boost. The AMD alternative But it may take more than benchmarks to convinced all hardware makers. Dell Computer executives, for example, have been skeptical of Itanium. Though Dell has sold Itanium systems, its CEO, Michael Dell, has also expressed interest in Advanced Micro Devices' forthcoming Opteron chip. With Opteron, formerly known as Hammer, AMD offers a potentially cheaper and easier way to extend a server to 64 bits. The chip can handle both 32-bit applications and 64-bit applications and operating systems by extending AMD's current chip architecture to 64 bits. AMD calls this X86-64. Because it's an extension of AMD's current processor, it will also cost less than the Itanium 2 and will not require companies to create an entirely new line of hardware and software, AMD has said. The first Opteron chip is expected next year at 2GHz or more. Michael Dell, despite chumming around with AMD Chairman Jerry Sanders at a recent conference, has yet to say whether his company will support either Itanium 2 or Opteron.
2006-01-19 - Intel scraps once-crucial Itanium feature  With the next Itanium chip, Intel has abandoned a feature it once banked on but that never proved successful, CNET News.com has learned. Circuitry to let Itanium run software for x86 chips, such as Pentium and Xeon chips, is not present in the forthcoming "Montecito" processor, according to the 176-page reference manual for the chip published this week (click here for PDF). Instead, anyone wishing to run programs for x86 chips on Montecito must use Intel emulation software called IA-32 Execution Layer, or IA-32 EL, that was first released in 2004. "IA-32 EL provides much better performance and flexibility for 32-bit applications on Itanium," spokeswoman Erica Fields said of the choice. "With Montecito, we took back the silicon area that was being used up by the x86 hardware support." The change, which Intel had refused to discuss until now, reflects the company's diminished Itanium ambitions, which cast the chip as being only for higher-end servers. Intel's retreat to that market segment was in part because Itanium couldn't run x86 software effectively, which imposed major transition burdens on software companies and server customers. Itanium's delays and poor initial performance meant that the x86 support wasn't useful when it arrived. The chip also lacked support for newer x86 features. "Basically, no one ever used hardware-based IA-32 execution, so better to use the silicon for something else," said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. "Of course, basically no one uses software-based emulation either, but at least that doesn't cost chip real estate." Support for IA-32 EL is necessary for operating systems on Montecito, according to the manual. "All OSes running on Montecito have a requirement to have IA-32 EL installed," the manual said. Microsoft Windows and major Linux versions include IA-32 EL. The emulation layer is considerably slower than a modern Xeon however: A 1.5GHz Itanium 2 processor runs emulated x86 instructions at about the same speed as a 1.5GHz Xeon processor, according to Intel. When Intel and Hewlett-Packard announced the collaboration to build what became the Itanium processor family in 1994, they promised the chips would be able to run software written for the two lines they were intended to replace, Intel's x86 chip and HP's PA-RISC. "The planned architecture will maintain binary compatibility with both companies' software bases," the companies said in the 1994 press release. Support for PA-RISC software came through an emulation technology called Aries, but Intel had hoped for faster x86 support by including direct hardware support on Itanium chips. Reworking software for Itanium isn't an onerous problem, especially for major software companies, but there's more to porting software than the initial technical work, Haff said. "The issue is providing service and support for a unique binary, not the port," he said. Itanium once had the support of all the top server makers. But Sun Microsystems--never a major Intel ally--canceled its Itanium version of Solaris in 2000, and IBM and Dell dropped their Itanium server products in 2005. Intel's most recent Itanium problem cropped up last October, when the chipmaker delayed Montecito's arrival from the end of 2005 to mid-2006. HP, which dominated the Itanium server market with 79 percent of all shipments in the third quarter of 2005, is working with Intel and others to improve Itanium's software availability. A year ago, HP pledged to spend $3 billion on Itanium software, hardware and marketing work. And more recently, HP and Intel joined lesser Itanium allies to launch the Itanium Solutions Alliance to improve software support. The alliance is still active. Members plan to announce a new funding initiative Jan. 26 in San Francisco.
2001-04-17 - Intel running short on 1GHz notebook chips Less than a month after releasing the 1GHz mobile Pentium III processor, Intel has told PC makers it cannot meet demand. Several PC makers said Intel contacted them late Monday delivering the bad news: Supplies of the new 1GHz chips will be tight until late May. The shortage is surprising, as it comes during an industrywide chip glut, analysts say. The timing could be terrible for Intel as it prepares to deliver first-quarter results after the market closes Tuesday. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report a year-over-year sales decline of about 17 percent and as much as 25 percent from the previous quarter. "They can just add this to all the bad news, get it all out there and start fresh looking to the future," said Technology Business Research analyst Humberto Andrade. Notebook makers are scrambling to manage the supply crisis, which is affecting manufacturers in different ways. Dell Computer, because of its production system emphasizing slim inventories of components, has been hit harder than some competitors. Company salespeople are quoting 30-day leads on the 1GHz Inspiron consumer notebook and putting prospective buyers on a waiting list. Dell also is steering customers who need a notebook now to the 900MHz Pentium III processor model with 256MB of RAM. But Dell spokesman Tom Kehoe emphasized that the company's direct selling approach will be an asset when Intel starts delivering an ample supply of chips. Intel production problems over the past 18 months: March 2001Commercial release of Itanium servers delayed until second half 2001. October 2000Bug in Pentium 4 chipset pushed back release of new chip from October to late November. Chip eventually released with a bug. August 2000 Timna, a low-cost processor with a built-in graphics chip, is canceled. Problems with chip stem from bugs with the Memory Translation Hub. August 28Intel says it is recalling its fastest Pentium III, the 1.13-GHz Pentium III, because of potentially faulty circuits. July 2000Intel says the first revenue from its high-end Itanium chip will come later than expected. A week earlier, Intel said most of the initial chips will ship at 733 MHz instead of the planned 800 MHz. May 2000 Intel recalls more than 1 million motherboards using its 820 chipset because of a faulty chip called the "memory translator hub" (MTH). The recall cost the company some $200 million. April 2000Intel says it has underestimated PC demand for the first half of the year and will continue to have problems supplying as many processors as computer makers want. February 2000 Intel discovers a bug that affects some server and workstation computers using Intel 840 and 820 chipsets. Though the glitch is rare, three motherboard designs are canceled in response. September 1999Intel delays the release of its 820 chipset because of problems connecting to Rambus-based memory. Compiled by: Ian Fried and Cecily Barnes "Once the supply does lighten up, we can get it there faster because we don't have to get it through the (dealer) channel," he said. Gateway, which also works on a low-inventory system, started seeing supply problems Friday, said company spokesman Greg Lund. A Gateway salesman reported end-of-May availability on the 1GHz Solo 9500 notebook. He recommended an 850MHz or 900MHz model with more memory and a larger hard drive deliverable in about two weeks. Dealers carrying IBM 1GHz models reported ample supply of some ThinkPad A22 notebooks but long lead times on others. Intel spokeswoman Shannon Johnson blamed the shortage on "unusually high demand, and we're very pleased with demand. We anticipate availability will be a little bit tight until the end of May, and then we'll see broader availability." But several PC makers said 1GHz notebook sales were consistent with their expectations. When told PC makers had reported normal demand for the 1GHz processor, Johnson again reiterated that, "We're seeing strong demand from our customers for the 1GHz processor. Absolutely." Mercury Research analyst Dean McCarron said Intel is likely getting lower-than-expected yields of the 1GHz processor and much better yields for the 900MHz. Yield, the percentage of usable chips coming off an assembly line, is often low at the beginning of a product cycle. "When they introduced the 1GHz desktop processor, they couldn't get any significant volume for almost three quarters," he said. "At the same time, they were delivering tens to hundreds of thousands of units of the 900MHz and 933MHz " processors. PC makers started selling 1GHz Pentium III notebooks only on March 19. But this wouldn't be the first time Intel had supply problems right out of the gate. The company delayed the release of the Pentium 4 processor late last year because of a chipset glitch, for example. IDC analyst Alan Promisel said the crisis would be worse if not for Intel's lock on the high-end mobile processor market. "Because of the absence of competitors in that high-performance processor space, it's not as big a deal as it could be," he said. McCarron noted that the situation might not be good for PC makers looking for price cuts on the chips, "because Intel doesn't have any competition." AMD is not expected to release a comparable mobile processor until June. But there is a silver lining for Intel and PC makers, Promisel said. The second quarter is typically the slowest sales period of the year. "If there is a good time for this kind of problem to happen, this is it," he said. "It's the third and fourth quarter where you want things running smoothly. From a damage-control perspective, this is the right time." Gartner analyst Ken Dulaney said the problem points out larger concerns with Intel. "This problem is one Intel's own making," he said . "They push out too many processors way too fast that people don't need. I think hopefully this problem will get buyers to go out and buy 700MHz or 800MHz chips, which are a far better buy and will last just as long."
2004-02-18 - Intel reveals new 64-bit server chip   SAN FRANCISCO--Intel will come out with a server chip next quarter that adds 64-bit power to its current x86 line of processors, the company's chief executive said Tuesday. News.context What's new: Intel is set to release Nocona, a server chip that adds 64-bit power to its current x86 line of processors. Bottom line: The planned move further blurs the distinction between Intel's high-end server processor, the 64-bit Itanium, and the lower-end Xeon systems, forcing Intel to balance development, marketing and business partnership resources between the two families. More stories on this topic In a keynote speech at the Intel Developer Forum here, CEO Craig Barrett called the arrival of Nocona "one of the worst-kept secrets in San Francisco." Intel had been widely expected to show off such a chip. Nocona chips for two-processor servers will arrive in the second quarter, Barrett said, followed quickly by Prescott processors with 32/64-bit capability for single-processor servers and workstations. Prescott and Nocona are functionally the same processor but differ in cache size and bus speed. The 32/64-bit technology will then come to chips for servers with four or more processors in 2005, Barrett added. Technically, the chips are code-named Nocona for dual-processor systems, Prescott for single-processor systems and Potomac for four-processor systems, and the 32/64-bit capability goes by the code name Clackamas Technology. Although this means that Intel could bring a 32/64-bit chip to PCs soon, Barrett said the company has no plans do so in the near future. There are a few good reasons for this, PC executives and analysts have said for some time. Very little desktop software exists for 64-bit desktops, and the amount of memory that would go into a 64-bit desktop would greatly escalate the price. While Intel was expected to reveal its 32/64-bit plans at the conference, the chips are set to come out far earlier than most predicted. Most analysts thought that Intel's first 32/64-bit chip would be Tejas, due late in 2004 or early 2005. In December, one analyst, Rick Whittington of American Technology Research, predicted that Intel would release a 32/64-bit chip this year but admitted at the time that he had no solid evidence to back up the theory. Intel shows off 32/64-bit processingCraig Barrett, chief executive, Intel The move further blurs the distinction between Intel's high-end server processor, the 64-bit Itanium, and the lower-end Xeon systems, forcing Intel to balance development, marketing and business partnership resources between the two families. But it also frees Intel to begin a direct attack on rival Advanced Micro Devices, which led the 64-bit x86 market with its Opteron processor. Neil Hand, director of marketing for the enterprise server group at Dell, said the demand for Xeon servers that can handle large memory loads has been apparent for some time. Although Xeons can directly handle only 4GB of memory, many customers are buying them with 5GB or more of memory and using special tricks to take advantage of the extra memory. It's simply not as efficient as having a 64-bit chip, he said. Nocona and Itanium, he added, won't compete directly. Itanium is largely reserved for the highest-performing computers. Nocona and other 32/64-bit chips will serve the larger mass market. Itanium "is not going to necessarily turn into the predominant architecture for servers or workstations over time," he said. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a regular Enterprise Hardware column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. During his keynote, Barrett demonstrated a 64-bit x86 chip running on a Dell Dimension XPS desktop machine. The move to add 64-bit extensions to the existing x86 architecture is a long time in coming for Intel. Rival AMD has been taking such an approach for a while, having already shipped both its Opteron server chips and its Athlon 64 desktop processors. In its response to Intel, AMD pointed to its earlier shipment of a 64-bit x86 chip and to its "AMD64" branding of the technology. "AMD welcomes Intel to the world of AMD64, said Ben Williams, director of server and workstation marketing at AMD. He said the debate now will shift to other chip features, such as the memory controller built into the chip and the HyperTransport links between the processors. "Opteron is about the ability to go to 64 bit, but it is much more," Williams said. Difficult to swallow Intel deserves credit for making sure its 64-approach is compatible with AMD's, said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64, though "it must have been a hard thing for them to swallow." Intel is accustomed to leading, with AMD cloning technology afterward, he said. Intel, meanwhile, resisted the 64-bit x86 move, trying to spur the market for its new 64-bit Itanium architecture. Itanium is not directly compatible with today's x86 software, but it can run such programs through a slower emulation mode. "Their hand was forced," said Anil Vasudeva, an analyst at Imex Research. Still, Vasudeva said the opportunity for chips like Nocona is much larger than that for Itanium. Intel said it shipped 100,000 Itanium processors in 2003, and "the volume is expected to double this year," Barrett said. And indicating that Intel isn't cutting back on Itanium development, Barrett also mentioned new features coming to the processor family: power management to better balance performance with electricity consumption and waste heat; PCI Express connections to subsystems such as high-speed networks; and cache reliability to improve the integrity of data stored in special high-speed memory banks. Although the move may hurt its Itanium strategy, analysts say Intel faces no legal obstacles in adopting AMD's approach. Intel and AMD entered into an extensive cross-licensing deal in 1995 that largely will insulate Intel from legal liability in this area, according to legal experts. Among other things, adding 64-bit instructions enables support for more than 4GB of memory. Most desktop users aren't expected to need that much memory until later in the decade, but it takes years for hardware and software partners to support the 64-bit extensions so that the technology is ready in time when the memory requirement does arrive. Microsoft will support Intel's new architecture in the second half of 2004, a Microsoft representative said. Versions of the Linux operating system from Red Hat, SuSE Linux and MontaVista Software will support it in the second half, Barrett added. Novell's SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 is scheduled to arrive in July, with support for Intel's 64-bit extensions, SuSE spokesman Joe Eckert said. A beta version is due in March, he added. And Red Hat, the leading Linux seller, is testing its software now. It plans to ship software supporting Intel's 64-bit Xeon chips in the second quarter after the new processors begin shipping, said Red Hat spokeswoman Leigh Day. Intel's approach is compatible with AMD's, the Microsoft representative said. "There will be one operating system that will support all (64 bit) extended systems," the representative said. Barrett concurred, noting that the design of the chips from the two companies will differ but that software and OSes for this market "probably, for the most part, will run on both systems." Intel and AMD entered into an extensive cross-licensing deal in 1995 that largely will insulate Intel from legal liability in this area, according to legal experts.

2003-05-12 - Intel reveals Itanium 2 glitch Intel disclosed an electrical problem Monday that can cause computers using its flagship Itanium 2 processor to behave erratically or crash. Read more about Itanium Customers can sidestep the problem by setting the processor to run at a lower speed, said company spokeswoman Barbara Grimes, and Intel will replace the processor if customers want. The glitch affects only some chips, and then only in the case of "a specific set of operations in a specific sequence with specific data," Grimes said. "If the customer feels it's the right solution, we'll exchange processors with ones that aren't affected," she said. Intel has developed a simple software test that can determine whether a chip is affected. The problem likely is uncommon, Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood said. "These machines have been out there for a year, and it only now is showing up, so it's got to be pretty rare. If it's something that was more commonplace, we would have seen it a lot sooner, or they would have found it in their alpha or beta testing." Still, the problem is a black eye for Intel, which has been positioning its Itanium line to take on high-end chips from Sun Microsystems and IBM for use in powerful servers with dozens of processors. Intel isn't the only one to suffer processor hiccups. Early versions of Sun's top-end UltraSparc III also had a problem that could cause crashes. "Virtually everybody has these kinds of problems," Brookwood said. "When you consider the hundreds of millions of transistors that go into these complex designs, it's amazing we don't see these more often." The Itanium 2 has data protection features and a 64-bit design that can handle vast amounts of memory, making it better suited to high-end servers than 32-bit processors such as Intel's Xeon and Pentium. Its performance has been good enough to boost Windows servers to the upper echelons of the server market, but the processor family's arrival has been clouded by initial delays and by the difficulties of running software written for Pentium chips. A computer maker found the electrical problem in stress testing earlier this year, and Intel confirmed it was a problem with the chips, not the software nor other parts of system design, Grimes said. The problem affects both 900MHz and 1GHz versions of the Itanium 2, code-named McKinley. However, it doesn't affect a faster 1.5GHz successor--called Itanium 2 6M and formerly code-named Madison--that is set for release in mid-2003, she said. The ripple effect The problem has begun rippling through the computer industry. IBM said Monday that it has put shipments of its just-released x450 Itanium 2 server on hold until the glitch is fixed and is notifying customers that have the systems. "Until we're sure the issues are 100 percent resolved, we're going to keep holding back shipments with the 450," IBM spokeswoman Lisa Lanspery said. "We have a policy of zero tolerance for undetected data corruption" at a customer site, she said. The move doesn't affect IBM's overall Itanium plans, which include a server based on the Itanium 2 6M and planned for later in 2003, she said. Hewlett-Packard, which co-developed the Itanium design and is building the processor family into its entire server line, said computer shipment plans aren't affected because it's screening affected systems before they ship. The company is working to help customers that already bought the systems. "We'll do whatever meets the customer's total satisfaction," said HP spokeswoman Kathy Sowards. "We're working very closely with Intel to come to a resolution for any customers that may be affected." But the glitch can't be good for server salespeople already trying to sell Itanium 2 servers with the more powerful Itanium 2 6M processors just around the corner, Brookwood said. "Imagine if you're trying to convince a customer to buy a McKinley-based system. Customers will say, 'Maybe I'll wait until Madison becomes available,'" Brookwood said. One possible response is to offer McKinley systems with a free upgrade to Madison, he said. Dell Computer's plans aren't affected, company spokesman Eric Anderson said. Dell plans to ship a dual-processor Itanium 2 6M system later this year. Unisys, SGI and NEC all are shipping powerful multiprocessor servers using Itanium 2. NEC didn't respond to requests for comment, but Unisys and SGI said the glitch doesn't affect their short- or long-term Itanium plans. "Unisys is not changing Itanium 2 plans because Intel is making appropriate accommodations and has already defined a number of alternative workarounds," Unisys said in a statement. "We have examined these changes and discussed them fully within Unisys and with Intel, and we are confident that there will be no impact on our customers." To work around the problem, customers can turn the chip frequency down to 800MHz. "In our testing, the problem has not manifested itself when the frequency is lower," Grimes said. Intel has begun discussing plans with computer makers on how to deal with the problem, Grimes said. "Some may decide the problem isn't manifesting itself" and therefore no action is needed, she said. "Others may decide to turn the frequency down as a temporary solution until they can switch out the processors. Others may already have plans to do a free upgrade to Madison." Intel has distributed to computer makers the software that can check for the problem. But the software test doesn't yield results as firm as Intel's own manufacturing test, Grimes said. Intel deserves credit for its up-front dealings with the issue, Brookwood said. "When they discover this kind of stuff, they now understand how to deal with it from an organizational standpoint in terms of getting the word out and working with (computer makers) to get the situation corrected in a timely fashion," he said. "Nobody can accuse them of trying to sweep this under the rug."

2000-02-16 - Intel renames servers ups ante in communications   PALM SPRINGS, Calif.--Six months ago, Intel broadly outlined its plans to enter the communications field. Today, the company is expected to provide details on how it plans to tackle the new market. The chipmaking giant will roll out the Netstructure line of Internet servers and detail plans on how it will work with universities to corral research and development around its line of communications chips at the Intel Developer Forum here. The announcements highlight two major strategies of the company: to expand into providing equipment for building the Internet's infrastructure and to diversify its business lines beyond microprocessors for PCs. Yesterday, during a dust-up with Sun Microsystems over an effort to bring Sun's Solaris operating system to servers running Intel's upcoming Itanium processor, Intel signaled that one of its main ambitions lay in taking on Sun in selling the nuts and bolts equipment of the Internet. Networking is shaping up to be the most significant venture in Intel's strategy to expand beyond PC processors. With PC sales growth nearing a plateau, the company in the past two years has been seeking out new markets to maintain its historical financial returns. The Netstructure line of servers is aimed largely at making Intel a player in the field of business Internet appliances, dedicated servers currently being made by companies like Cobalt. The seven new products are small servers dedicated to perform specific functions that ideally will make e-commerce more smooth and orderly. "These are not general purpose platforms. These are fixed function devices that do one or two things well," said John Miner, general manager of the communications product group at Intel. The Netstructure line derives from technology Intel acquired when it bought iPivot and Dialogic, he said. The SSL acceleration server, for instance, will be designed to handle encryption and identification functions for Secure Sockets Layer transactions. Typical general-purpose Web servers can handle up to 500 simultaneous general requests. That number can drop down to 50 requests when more intensive SSL identification requests come in, asserted Miner. Intel's SSL server can handle up to 250 to 500 SSL exchanges at once, which can ideally free up general Web servers and speed up the transaction process. Other Netstructure products will be developed for improving how voice can be used on the Internet, he said. Although these devices are also in the works at longtime Intel partners like HP, Miner stated that the product line does not represent a conflict with these companies as it combines computing technology, which Intel sells to its computing customers, with communications software the company has picked up on its own. "It is not about hardware. It is about functionality. This is a communications product," Miner said. PC companies, however, could not be reached for comment. In addition, the company will outline plans for expanding its influence in communications chips. Intel will sponsor research and Ph.D. programs at seven major universities, including MIT and Princeton, for developing research into communications processors, said Mark Christensen, vice president and general manager of the networking communications group. Christensen will also trot out customer wins for the company's IXA brand of communications processors. Approximately 30 companies have agreed to adopt the IXA processor line, Christensen said. The IXA chips, announced last September, have yet to hit the market.
2000-05-22 - Intel releases new Xeon chips running at 700 MHz   Intel has released its most powerful processor to date, a new Xeon that takes advantage of technology introduced with earlier, lower-end Pentium III chips. The new Xeons run at 700 MHz and are built with the cache as part of the chip itself, said Anthony Ambrose, a marketing manager for Intel's high-end chip group. Earlier Xeons top out at 550 MHz and have a separate and therefore slower cache, the special high-speed memory used to keep the processor fed with data and things to do. The chip is the most powerful to date, a rung up on the ladder Intel is climbing to try to displace brawnier chips from Sun Microsystems, IBM, Compaq Computer, SGI and Hewlett-Packard. These processors are used in the growing market for mammoth servers that contain dozens of chips and cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars--a prestigious and profitable product category. With this "onboard" cache and higher clock speed, servers doing jobs such as database transactions show performance gains of about 25 percent to 40 percent over the older Xeons, Ambrose said. The chips will be hard to come by for at least two months, however. "Demand has outstripped supply on the 700 (MHz Xeon) for the next 60 days or so," Ambrose said. Intel expects to meet demand in the third quarter of 2000, he said. The new Xeons will be used in a 32-processor server from Unisys that Compaq also is selling, Ambrose said. And IBM will use the Xeons in a new 64-processor machine to be announced later this week, based on the Numa-Q design IBM acquired by buying Sequent. Intel has a ways to go, though. Servers with the new Xeons, while more powerful than their predecessors, still don't have the market position of those from IBM, HP or Sun. Intel's effort to take on these higher-powered systems will accelerate most dramatically later this year with the arrival of the Itanium chip, a completely new design for Intel. "In general, the server segment is extremely crucial to Intel," Ambrose said, though he added, "Clearly, the desktop market is much bigger." In addition to being the most powerful, the chip also is Intel's largest CPU to date--a walloping 140 million transistors, five times the number on the ordinary Pentium IIIs. A new 700-MHz Xeon with 2MB of cache will cost $1,980 in quantities of 1,000. A version with 1MB cache will cost $1,177. Although more expensive than desktop processors, these introductory prices are low, historically speaking, for Xeons. The 2MB version is debuting at the price formerly given to the 1MB version. The lower prices are likely designed to blunt potential competition from AMD's upcoming Mustang processor, a variant on the Athlon for servers, and pave the way for the introduction of Itanium and Foster, two server processors from Intel. Another advantage for the new Xeons is that they're built with Intel's 0.18-micron manufacturing process, which enables more chips to be sliced from a single wafer of silicon. The first chips built on the 0.18-micron process and using onboard cache were Intel's "Coppermine" line of Pentium IIIs that debuted in 1999. Xeons differ from ordinary Pentium IIIs because they can be grouped into bunches of four and can address larger sizes of memory, making them more useful for powerful servers that have to handle tasks such as managing access to databases. The Xeons also come with much larger caches. The older 550-MHz Xeons will continue to be sold, Ambrose said. The chips are used in servers that customers usually test for long periods of time, so new chips aren't added to the product line as fast as with desktop machines.
2000-01-13 - Intel releases new Xeon chip to little fanfare An improved version of Intel's Pentium III Xeon processor was greeted with yawns from computer manufacturers which see the new chip as too similar to the standard Pentium III. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip giant yesterday introduced an 800-MHz version of its Xeon. Arguably Intel's most powerful processor to date, the chip can be used in complex multiprocessor server and workstation systems. Unfortunately, the chip's performance characteristics are almost identical to the recently released 800-MHz Pentium III, according to industry analysts and PC company personnel. But while the Xeon costs $901 per chip in volume quantities, the Pentium III goes for $50 less. Perhaps as a result, no major PC makers announced equipment using the chip, an Intel spokesman confirmed, although a number of companies are planning products for the near future. Xeon's identity crisis stems from an overlap on Intel's product road map. Historically, Xeon processors have outperformed Pentium II or III chips running at the same clock speed, but recent changes have minimized the difference, undermining the Xeon's market appeal. Xeons contain the same processor "core" as standard Pentium II or Pentium III chips but typically have come with a "secondary cache" that was both larger and faster than the cache on standard Pentium IIIs. Secondary cache is a memory reservoir located near the processor that keeps the chip fed with data. The character of the cache helps determine the processor's overall ability. Until recently, the secondary cache for both the Pentium III and Xeon lines came on separate memory chips. In October, though, Intel launched the "Coppermine" Pentium III and Pentium III Xeon processors, both of which come with integrated cache, which runs faster than the older, separate cache. While integration of a 256K cache raised the bar for Intel's chips, it largely erased the differences between the Pentium IIIs and Xeons coming out just now. "The Xeons basically are all Pentium IIIs," Dean McCarron, principal at Mercury Research, summarized in a November interview. Xeons with larger caches are coming, but they aren't here yet. The chip is still relatively popular in servers, especially the more elaborate multiprocessor boxes. Both Compaq and Dell, for instance, incorporate Xeon in their more expensive "enterprise" class severs, and put Pentium IIIs in the less expensive single- or dual-processor servers for workgroups or small offices. The chip has been less used in the smaller workstation market. Since the differences have been reduced, Dell and HP have not picked up any new Xeons, opting instead to use Pentium IIIs. In fact, HP has said that its future workstation products will only contain Pentium IIIs: Just yesterday the company released a new workstation that incorporates the 733-MHz Pentium III. The system also forsakes Rambus-style memory, which Intel has been pushing. Xeons coming later this year will contain 1MB and 2MB of cache. This will once again create a difference between the Pentium III and the Xeon line. But the line will find itself atop the Intel chip family for a limited time. By the middle of the year, Intel is planning to release Itanium, its first 64-bit processor, and "Willamette," a new family of 32-bit processors based around a more advanced architecture. Both chips will likely outperform the current Xeon design.
2005-03-30 - Intel releases new high-end Xeon processors    SAN FRANCISCO--Intel released on Tuesday a new generation of Xeon chips, its first high-end models to include 64-bit features designed to easily accommodate large amounts of memory. The new Xeon MP models, designed for machines with four processors, include the 64-bit extensions that Intel previously sold only in Xeon DP models for dual-processor servers. There are two new Xeon MP varieties: the less expensive "Cranford" model with 1MB of high-speed cache memory and the more powerful "Potomac" model with either 4MB or 8MB of cache. Intel unveiled the processors at an event here with top server executives from x86 server market leader Hewlett-Packard and rivals Dell, IBM and Unisys. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker also began selling an accompanying E8500 chipset, code-named Twin Castle, that connects the processors to the rest of the system and is meant to improve memory, data transfer and input-output features. Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices pioneered the 64-bit extensions to such x86 processors and already sold 64-bit models for four-processor servers. Even with only dual-processor models available, though, servers with Intel's 64-bit processors already outsell those with AMD's chips. AMD hopes to leapfrog Intel again in mid-2005 by introducing dual-core processors, which employ two processing engines on each slice of silicon. Intel's dual-core processors, both DP and MP models, will arrive in early 2006, said Jeff Richardson, general manager of Intel's Server Platforms Group. The arms race is a new feature for the x86 server market, on which customers spent $6.1 billion in 2004, according to Gartner. Intel had the market to itself for most of the 10 years that have gone by since the company introduced its first server-oriented product, the Pentium Pro, for dual-processor machines. Intel and AMD both hope to grow at the expense of processor alternatives such as Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc and IBM's Power. Customers should be able to upgrade the new servers introduced Tuesday with dual-core processors coming in 2006, said Pat Gelsinger, senior vice president of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group. "Our intention is that you'll be able to drop the dual cores...into the same sockets as we come to those product offerings next year," Gelsinger said. "That's what customers are looking for." The top-end Xeon MP running at 3.33GHz with 8MB of cache memory costs $3,692 when purchased 1,000 at a time, Intel said. A somewhat slower 3GHz model costs $1,980. That price tag is not far from the current top-end Itanium processor, which costs $4,227 and includes 9MB of cache. A third Potomac model with 4MB of cache and a 2.83GHz clock speed cuts the cost to $1,177. Two Cranford models also went on sale, both with 1MB of cache. A 3.66GHz model costs $963, while the 3.16GHz model costs $722, Intel said. The E8500 chipset costs $255. The chipset includes two front-side buses, the data pathways that lead to the processors, instead of the single pathway of prior generations. In addition, the front-side bus operates at 667MHz instead of 400MHz and has better error-correction technology. The chipset also supports DDR2 (double data rate 2) memory, which is faster and consumes less power than prevailing technology, and the PCI Express input-output technology, which is faster than today's prevailing PCI.
2002-02-24 - Intel puts on its show with Prestonia  What to expect at Intel Developer ForumMichael Kanellos, senior editor, CNET News.com Intel on Monday will unveil its first server chip based on the Pentium 4 architecture as it continues to stake a larger claim in the upper echelons of the computing world. The company's new Xeon chip, code-named Prestonia, will feature a host of improvements that will, along with complementary technology coming out the same day, provide a performance boost to one- and two-processor Intel-based servers. To date, Intel has sold Xeon chips based on the older Pentium III architecture in this market, although the company already sells a Pentium 4/Xeon similar to Prestonia in the workstation market. "Depending on the particular benchmark you use, it is 20 to 30 to 50 percent faster," said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64. "You're not going to get twice the performance, but you get more, and it doesn't cost much more." Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Dell Computer, among others, will show off new servers based on Prestonia this week at the Intel Developer Forum, a four-day conference dedicated to all things Intel starting Monday in San Francisco. Among other highlights, Intel will display the first Pentium 4 for mobiles, discuss a low-power mobile chip for 2003 called Banias, present updates on tech standards, and sketch out how Moore's Law will begin to affect other parts of the industry. Prestonia in some ways will also mark the start of an active year in the lucrative server market for the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip giant. Along with Prestonia, Intel will release the E7500 chipset, code-named Plumas, marking the effective return of the company into the server chipset market. Chipsets manage data traffic for the processor and connect the processor to memory and other components. In March, at the CeBit trade show in Germany, Intel will release a Pentium 4-based Xeon that can be used in servers capable of handling four or more processors, according to sources. These chips will also sport a new 1MB third level of cache, reservoirs of memory located near the processor for rapid data access. Prestonia at a glance Features of new Intel server chip Speed: 2.2 GHz Memory capacity: 16GB Memory type: DDR RAM Input-output: Six PCI-X buses Source: Intel Starting next week, Intel will also crank up the momentum on McKinley, the next version of the Itanium chip, which will compete directly against chips from Sun Microsystems and IBM. While Intel controls approximately 90 percent of the one- and two-processor server market, and a substantial portion of the four-way market, it's a relative stranger to the highest regions of the server market. The company has touted McKinley as its entry vehicle here, but slow customer acceptance, a potential lack of software and macroeconomic circumstances could stump its effort. Concurrently, the company will likely begin to more openly discuss the successors to McKinley, including Madison, Montecito, Deerfield and Chivano. Prestonia inside Prestonia enhances the Xeon line in three ways, according to Lisa Hambrick, director of enterprise processor marketing at Intel. First, by switching to the Pentium 4 architecture, Intel can drastically boost the clock speed. The old server Xeon topped out at 1.4GHz. The new one debuts at 1.8GHz, 2GHz and 2.2GHz, and will eventually pass 10GHz, she said. "You can't reach that with a Pentium III," Hambrick said. "You start to flatten out. You can only go so high in frequency." Second, the chip, in conjunction with chipsets and other components, will feature wider and faster buses--data pathways between the processor and everything else in the computer. Greater aggregate bandwidth means greater performance. Prestonia, for instance, comes with a 400MHz main bus between the processor and memory, faster than the 133MHz bus on Pentium III Xeons. The chips will also be capable of accessing data from 16GB of memory vs. just 12GB before. Prestonia will also work with chipsets featuring PCI-X, an input-output channel between the chipset and storage devices or networks that runs at 133MHz, twice as fast as the older PCI standard. Plumas, which features six PCI-X channels, can handle 3.2GB of data per second. Third, the chips will come with hyper-threading, a new technology from Intel that lets a single chip execute two applications or processes at the same time. In a hypothetical example, if one of the processor's integer units is churning graphics calculations, hyper-threading will allow the floating-point unit to tackle another problem. It's similar to having two processors, but not as powerful. "They may be glamorizing it a little bit, but the claims are valid," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. "There will be ample opportunity to exploit the hardware resources." One benefit of hyper-threading is that most current applications that have been designed (or multi-threaded) to run on two processor servers can get some advantage out of it, Hambrick said. Some companies are also further fine-tuning their applications specifically for wringing out performance from hyper-threaded chips. The chip also features 512KB of secondary cache, a reservoir of memory located near the processor for rapid data access, more than most Pentium III-based Xeons. The commercial picture So who will buy Prestonia systems? Computer executives and customers have generally spoken positively about the prospects for servers incorporating the Pentium 4 Xeons. Historically, Xeon-based servers have been relatively inexpensive compared with RISC-Unix servers. The 2.2GHz chip sells for $615, while the 2GHz sells for $417 and the 1.8GHz goes for $251. To some degree, the Xeon line has also slightly dimmed the appeal of Itanium-based servers, which have commercially made only a marginal impact so far. "You've got really good Xeon-class products," McCarron said. "If they weren't there, Intel would probably sell more Itaniums." While Intel will continue to upgrade the Xeon line, new chips won't be introduced as fast as desktop chips. The server market doesn't require as rapid an upgrade cycle. Intel will release a new Xeon for one- and two-processor servers every three to six months, Hambrick said, while processors for servers with four or more processors will come out every nine to 12 months.
2000-07-18 - Intel pushes back schedule for Itanium chip    Intel's Itanium schedule slipped a notch today, as the company said the need for another revision to the chip will mean it can't begin selling its future flagship product as soon as expected. Intel said it won't start receiving revenue from the Itanium chip, the company's first 64-bit processor, until the fourth quarter of this year. The company earlier expected revenue to begin in the third quarter. In addition, the only computers using the chip to ship this year will be "pilot systems," and the general availability will encroach even further on Itanium's successor, code-named McKinley and due to arrive in the second half of 2001. Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel architecture group, said testing and other tasks to ensure that the new architecture was bulletproof prompted Intel to delay the product. "The overall task of validating and fixing everything...pushed us to look at it one quarter further out than we thought," Otellini said. "This is a different environment for us." Consequently, general availability for Itanium won't begin until the first half of next year. "We expect our customers to offer general availability of hardware, software (and other Itanium products) over the first half of 2001," Otellini said. Added spokesman Bill Kircos: "The change of recognition of revenue is a result of requiring an additional processor revision prior to moving to the pilot release." The news is a vindication for skeptics who doubted Intel's ambitious and already delayed schedule. The Itanium chip and its successors in the IA-64 family are geared to muscle into the market for servers based on elaborate, high-priced chip designs from Sun Microsystems, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer and SGI. "I think there are still some delays in getting the chip really ready to go and getting the (computer manufacturers) ready to run with it," said Linley Group analyst Linley Gwennap. "This is what I expected a year ago. It was going to take longer than they thought." Itanium, which was known for years by its code name, Merced, is expected to debut at speeds of 733 MHz and 800 MHz, Kircos said. The schedule hasn't changed for McKinley, Kircos said. McKinley also will debut in "pilot systems" near the end of 2001. In early 2001, early samples of the chip will be sent to manufacturers, Kircos said. Analysts and even some computer makers have been warning that Itanium systems would largely be used to debug the new hardware design and accompanying software. However, they have generally agreed that the IA-64 family would prevail in the long term as a number of new design features provide for more muscular Intel server designs. Hewlett-Packard, which invented the design underlying the IA-64 family but expected it to come to market much earlier, has described a modest pace of adoption for the new chip. Manufacturers, in fact, have been economizing on their development funds for Itanium for a while. Intel, for example, will actually manufacture Itanium servers for some computer makers and will sell motherboards to all of them, the company said. This cuts down on independent design costs. "For two- and four-ways, we've got a popular motherboard configuration," Kircos said. Bucking the trend, Intel server stalwart Compaq is building its own four-chip Itanium server. Intel is also not designing its own chipset for eight-processor Itanium servers, said a company spokesman. The company will make eight-way chipsets for Foster, a version of the Pentium 4 for servers coming in the first quarter of next year, and McKinley, the successor to Itanium. The revision to the Itanium will take the form of a new "stepping," a modification to the chip design, Kircos said. The chip currently is in its "b" series of steppings, a source familiar with the chip said. Currently there are about 15,000 Itaniums in 5,000 systems in the hands of software and hardware designers, he said. Unlike the fanfare that's surrounded the debuts of Pentium chips, Intel doesn't plan doesn't plan a big to-do for Itanium, Kircos said. "We'll have a series of milestones. There won't be one processor launch per se," he said.
2005-10-24 - Intel pushes back Itanium chips revamps Xeon   Intel has delayed by months the release of the next three major versions of the Itanium processor, a new blow for the processor family. But the chipmaker also plans a change it said will boost the performance of its more widely used Xeon line. The next Itanium, a major revision code-named Montecito, recently had been scheduled for debut this year, holding volume production until the first quarter of 2006 so the chipmaker can address quality problems. Now, however, it will debut in mid-2006, spokeswoman Erica Fields said Monday. Its successor, "Montvale," was pushed from late 2006 to 2007, and the next major redesign, "Tukwila," was pushed from 2007 to 2008. In addition, Montecito won't incorporate the "Foxton" technology that would allowed the chip to run faster when it had cooled. Consequently, its top speed has been reduced from 2GHz to 1.6GHz, Fields said. Another change will be removal of higher-end Monticito models whose front-side bus--the connection to the rest of the system--runs at 667MHz, leaving only the 400MHz and 533MHz models. "It was required for us to do additional work to meet the production-level quality Intel is known for," Fields said of the delay, though she wouldn't detail what quality issues had emerged. Faced with initial delays, poor performance and software incompatibility with Xeon, Intel in recent years backed off its ambition to make Itanium the processor of choice for all servers. Instead, the company tailored it for higher-end machines that compete with those using IBM's Power and mainframe chips and Sun Microsystems' Sparc line. Hewlett-Packard, which initiated the chip project, remains a major backer, but Dell and IBM have dropped Itanium support, and Microsoft's future version of Windows for Itanium will be suited only for high-end jobs. The Itanium delay "is generally bad news," and competitors will likely pounce all over it, said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff, but it doesn't change the overall competition between the top server makers. "HP still has a competitive high-end processor from Intel, even with this slippage," Haff said. HP remains "fully committed to continuing to drive positive momentum for the Itanium-based HP Integrity server family," the company said in a statement, citing 113 percent growth in Integrity revenue in the July quarter. Things look rosier for Xeon, which enjoys widespread market popularity. However, rival Advanced Micro Devices has been gaining share with its Opteron chip. "Breathing room" for Intel "Intel has some breathing room, but they need to get moving," said Gartner analyst Martin Reynolds. Intel scrapped one Xeon design, "Whitefield," and replaced it with another, "Tigerton." Both are high-end models geared for systems with four or more processors. The major difference between them is that Tigerton chips are joined to the rest of the system with a technology Intel is calling the "dedicated high-speed interconnect." With that technology, each processor will have its own connection to a computer's chipset rather than today's design, where chips share a data pathway called a front-side bus. "Each processor has its own connection to the chipset," Field said, providing "significantly better system performance." The high-speed interconnect is a significant change for Intel--but customers won't have to wait until 2007 to see how well they do, said one source familiar with the chipmaker's plans. In fact, the interconnect will make its debut in the second quarter of 2006 with Intel's "Dempsey" processor, a dual-core chip designed for dual-processor systems. That change has another consequence: The delay of an Intel plan called the Common Platform Architecture that would mean Itanium and Xeon processors would share the same interconnect and chipsets. The plan would have simplified system design and been instrumental in eliminating cost differences. The demise of the common design is less significant today than when Intel began publicizing the approach more than a year ago. "Driving down Itanium cost points so it could bring 64-bit computing for the masses--that was an important message a few years ago. It's almost irrelevant today, aside from saving Intel some engineering with joint chipset development," Haff said. Tigerton will be succeeded by another chip in 2008 code-named Dunnington. Both chips will fit into the so-called platform, Intel's term for a chip combined with its supporting chipset. The platform is code-named Caneland. One successful approach that AMD embraced is the inclusion of the memory controller within the processor. In contrast, Intel's approach is to build the memory controller into the attached chipset. Communication delays, called latency, decrease with the on-board controller approach. But the approach causes some timing complications when one processor needs to access data stored in memory affiliated with another processor. Fields declined to comment on whether Caneland-based systems will use the new interconnect. But Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood thinks not, expecting that Intel would love to trumpet that scenario if it could. "They're getting so beat up over it," he said. With Caneland systems lasting through 2008, it could be 2009 before high-end Xeon chips get an on-board memory controller. But Intel could have other tricks up its sleeve. "I think there is a reasonable probability that Tigerton and the Caneland platform do not use an on-chip memory controller. However, I think it's premature to speculate what the performance implications are without knowing a lot more about what the architecture is," Haff said. Tigerton, like the Whitefield chip it replaces, will be built on Intel's next-generation microarchitecture, a fundamental chip design geared to consume less power and stemming from the lineage of Pentium M processors that began with "Banias." Intel, like its competitors, is adding more processing engines, called cores, to its chips. Tigerton is a four-core processor.
2004-10-02 - Intel programming tools reach new 64-bit chips Intel has begun selling programming tools that let developers create software that supports 64-bit x86 chips, an important step in making the new generation of processors useful. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker plans to announce on Monday the new version of its compiler, an essential tool that translates software written by humans into instructions a computer can understand. Intel earlier this year began selling Xeon and Pentium 4 processors with 64-bit extensions called EM64T that enable the processors to easily use more than 4GB of memory. Intel's 64-bit chips came more than a year after rival Advanced Micro Devices came out with its own version of the idea, called AMD64, in its Opteron and Athlon 64 products. The compilers create code for either Intel or AMD chips, said James Reinders, director of marketing for Intel software development products. "Our customers are interested in producing code that runs well on their customers' machines. Some percentage of that is going to be non-Intel," he said. "Our code works at least as well as any other compiler for AMD's processors." Intel's compiler will come in versions for Linux, which already is available in 64-bit versions from Red Hat and Novell, and for Windows, which because of delays won't support 64-bit x86 chips until 2005. Among the customers for the programming tools are IBM and Oracle, who build their database software with it, Reinders said. And even though open-source programmers overwhelmingly prefer the GCC compiler--itself an open-source project--Red Flag Linux and the MySQL database use it, Reinders said. The computing industry is avidly monitoring the spread of 64-bit x86 chips, which also can run the prevailing 32-bit software. Intel for years favored a different 64-bit design, Itanium, which can run 32-bit x86 software only slowly and awkwardly. But Intel now positions Itanium only for higher-end machines, and the chip's biggest promoter, Hewlett-Packard, discontinued selling Itanium workstations in favor of 64-bit x86 models. The compiler costs $399 for compiling C and C++ programs for Windows and Linux; versions to compile programs written in Fortran range from $499 to $1,399. Sun Microsystems, a relatively new convert to the x86 server market, is aggressively pushing its Solaris operating system for the chips, but Intel doesn't plan to support it. "We want to be responsive to our customers, and we see them moving away from vendor-specific Unix to x86 Linux, so that's where our offering is focused," spokesman Michael Houlihan said. Intel's revenue stems chiefly from chips, but the company's software efforts are a critical catalyst to making chip improvements useful. Right now, the company is focusing not just on 64-bit extensions, but also on new chips that are better at doing multiple jobs at once. The first generation of these multitasking chips came with Intel's hyperthreading technology, which lets a processor quickly flick to a second instructions sequence, or thread, when the primary thread is idly waiting for new data. The next generation of the technology will come in 2005, when Intel releases dual-core chips that combine two separate processing cores onto the same slice of silicon. From a software perspective, multithreading and multiple cores mean essentially the same programming problem: how to write software that can do multiple tasks simultaneously. It's a tricky issue, and mainstream software has only rudimentary support for it, Reinders said. Sometimes programmers split tasks into two threads--one for a program's main engine and one for its user interface, for example--but that's a matter of programming convenience, not performance, Reinders said. The next step will be breaking down software modules into separate threads. For example, a video game that features simulated physical effects might break down each effect into separate threads rather than having one thread for the entire physics engine, he said. To make this change easier, Intel sells other software tools. Its VTune software can monitor the performance of individual threads so programmers can see how efficient various approaches are. And its Thread Checker software checks software as it runs to find instances when two threads are incorrectly synchronized. "It's a bad thing if one (thread) has to write data and the other has to read it and they're out of order," he said, and worse, synchronization errors can be hard to track down because they aren't predictable. "The experience of moving your code to a threaded environment can be very frustrating."
2003-05-07 - Intel programming tools edge forward   Database giant Oracle has chosen Intel to supply crucial programming tools called compilers for creating software that runs on servers using Intel processors. The move is one of several steps Intel is taking to improve the software's utility. Oracle will use the compilers for versions of its software that run on the Windows and Linux operating systems using Intel 32-bit processors such as Xeon and 64-bit processors from the Itanium line, Intel said Wednesday. Compilers translate higher-level software written by humans in languages such as C into instructions that a computer can understand. The quality of a compiler has a direct bearing on how fast compiled software runs, particularly on the Itanium family of chips. Oracle's decision goes against the grain of most Linux programming today, which uses the open-source GCC compiler. On Windows, Microsoft's Visual Studio tools are very popular, though the software can accept Intel's compiler as a plug-in. In addition, Intel said its new compiler, version 7.1, can create software optimized for its new Pentium M processor. The Pentium M, a chip with low power-consumption features and a part of Intel's Centrino products for wireless laptops, has differences from both the older Pentium III and the current Pentium 4 families. Intel's C++ compiler costs $399 for Windows or Linux; the Windows and Linux compilers for the Fortran language costs $499 and $699, respectively. Compilers are used to build not just higher-level software such as databases, but also to build foundational packages such as the operating system. But for the heart of Linux, called the kernel, it's been difficult to compile software using anything other than GCC. Intel has been working to make its own compilers more compatible with GCC so that it can respond to customers' desires to build the Linux kernel with the Intel compilers. "Building the Linux kernel with the Intel C++ Compiler is an ongoing project at Intel. The goal is to improve GCC source compatibility and to find opportunities to improve kernel performance," Intel said in a paper on its Web site. Version 7.0 of Intel's compiler has been used to build Linux kernels, but only with special modifications to the kernel, the paper said. Intel hopes to eliminate those modifications by modifying its compiler and by working with the Linux programming community to change some features of the kernel. For example, Intel programmers have submitted kernel patches to permit use of the Intel compiler.
2004-06-15 - Intel program to certify server components In a move that makes it more like a full-fledged server maker, Intel announced a program Monday to certify that its "building block" components work with hardware add-ons and software packages from other companies. Intel makes most of its money selling components such as processors, but has been gradually extending into higher-level design and assembly, producing near-finished server packages. Certification takes this process one step further, though Intel says it won't go as far as building complete machines. Certifying the compatibility of the software or hardware later added by other vendors--a process that server makers usually handle--can head off problems and reassure customers. Intel's program is designed to make it easier for smaller computer makers to build higher-end Intel-based servers using four Xeon processors or two Itanium 2 processors, said Dave Wheat, the senior marketing manager responsible for the new Enterprise Server Acceleration Alliance. Companies that lack the resources of a computer giant such as Dell often make their products using off-the-shelf components from Intel. Peter Glaskowsky, an independent analyst, said being able to offer certified products could give smaller computer makers a better chance at selling higher-end products. "Certifications have been one of those things that if you had the resources to do it, you had an edge," he said. "If Intel makes it easier for companies to offer certified systems, then it makes a competitive shift to those smaller companies." While dominant companies such as Dell, Hewlett-Packard or IBM probably aren't worried, the Intel program could put more pressure on medium-size computer makers further down the pecking order, he said. Wheat acknowledged that some might not be eager to see any leveling of this playing field, but added, "It's also very valuable in...allowing the small and medium businesses to have access to what was typically a very high-end solution." So far, companies certifying their products in the program include database seller Oracle; backup systems specialist Quantum; InfiniCon, which makes adapters and switches for the high-speed InfiniBand network technology; and EMC's VMware, which sells virtualization software to subdivide a server so it can run several operating systems. Intel has been gradually expanding from selling just its processor products to higher-level products as well, including chipsets that join processors to other parts of a system, network controllers, and motherboards packed with all a computer's electronics. Intel already sells complete Itanium 2 servers and sophisticated blade servers. In another sphere, the company is working to assemble kits that will let smaller companies effectively sell white-box storage systems as well. Although the company makes complete servers in some cases, it doesn't sell them under its own brand name but provides them to general computer makers such as Bull in France or Lenovo in China. In the long run, Intel will stop short of offering products as complete as Dell's, Wheat said. "We are a building-block supplier. That is our business and the business we're going to stay in. Dell really owns the solution top to bottom," he said. "What we can do is assist in getting some of these certifications, but we will never own the entire system top to bottom." Intel has had some rough times with one key server building block: chipsets, a market that Broadcom subsidiary ServerWorks has dominated. But the situation is improving for Intel, as it gets better able to control the introduction of new server technology such as higher-speed memory. "From a technical standpoint, the ServerWorks people stumbled a little bit. Intel has really good chipsets for up to four-way (four-processor) servers," Glaskowsky said. "They've done a good job of taking a lot of the business back that ServerWorks had taken."
2011-02-20 - Intel previews next Itanium mainframe chip Intel is previewing its next Itanium processor today and improvements include better power management, reliability, and architecture. No timeline was set for the next Itanium, code-named Poulson. The next Itanium will be designed to take advantage of advances in the Xeon processor architecture. The two chips will also be pin compatible. Itanium is targeted at the Unix and mainframe markets. Xeons handle Windows, Solaris, and Linux machines Rory M. McInerney, vice president of the Intel Architecture Group and director of the Microprocessor Development Group, planned to preview Itanium at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference in San Francisco.

2002-12-05 - Intel plies new programming tools  Intel has released new programming tools designed to increase the performance of software written for its Pentium, Xeon and Itanium processors. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker on Tuesday began selling version 7.0 of its compilers, crucial programming tools that translate human-written software into instructions a computer can understand. The compilers are used for writing programs in the C++ and Fortran languages, running on Windows or Linux operating systems, and using Pentium, Xeon or Itanium 2 processors, Intel said. Compilers are a key part of the infrastructure that makes a processor useful. Improving a compiler can help a program run faster on the same hardware with no other changes. Intel also has used compiler technology to advance strategic goals such as its support for Linux. For Intel, compilers are crucial to the success of its chips. The version 7.0 products are the first to support features that help software take advantage of hyperthreading, a feature in Xeon and shortly to debut in Pentium that lets a single processor act in some ways like two. And Itanium, a departure from current prevailing chip designs from Intel and others, is very dependent on compilers that can keep the chip fed with data and instructions. The version 7.0 compilers create software on Itanium processors that runs about 15 percent faster than software created with the previous Intel compilers, the company said. Companies using Intel compilers include database giant Oracle and digital audio software maker MusicMatch. The Intel compilers can be plugged into software development tools such as Microsoft's Visual Studio. The C++ compilers for Linux and Windows cost $399. The Fortran compilers, which appeal largely to scientific and technical customers, cost $499 for the Windows version and $699 for the Linux version, Intel said.
2005-10-12 - Intel plans nine flavors of 'Montecito' Itanium    Intel is expected to begin the introduction of its "Montecito" processors with three models running at 1.6GHz and 1.4GHz, but by the end of the first half of next year, at least six more are scheduled to arrive. The broad portfolio is shown in an Intel road map seen by CNET News.com. The plan also shows an even broader portfolio of Xeons, a vastly more popular server chip that unlike Itanium can run the same software as other x86 chips such as Pentiums. The road map also shows that Itanium clock speeds will get a 200MHz boost from the addition of Intel's new "Foxton" technology, which lets chips run faster as long as they don't get too hot. Montecito, the first major redesign of Itanium in years, is the first in the family to come with two processing engines on one slice of silicon--a design called dual-core that rival chips from Sun Microsystems and IBM have had for years. Despite the significant change, Intel is retaining the Itanium 2 moniker, though augmented with a 9000-series numbering scheme. Intel declined to comment for this story. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker plans to ship Montecito in limited quantities this year, with full volume beginning in the first quarter of 2006. But the chip family was hit by delays, poor initial performance and software incompatibilities, and Intel has struggled to achieve mainstream acceptance. "Montecito is a fundamentally new, true dual-core design. It does get significant performance advantages over the previous single-core parts," said Peter Glaskowsky, an analyst at Envisioneering Group and system architect at MemoryLogix. Unfortunately for Intel, though, there are many fewer customers for the chip than the company would like, he added. In the meantime, Sun and IBM have grown more aggressive, releasing new UltraSparc and Power models that, like Montecito, use an improved manufacturing process with 90-nanometer features. And AMD has had success bringing higher-end features to x86 with its Opteron server chip. Hewlett-Packard, which initiated the Itanium project and co-developed the initial chips, is the major Itanium server seller, though Unisys, Silicon Graphics, NEC, Hitachi and Fujitsu also offer machines with the chip. IBM and Dell have dropped Itanium-based products from their server lines. But Intel isn't shying away from the Itanium challenge. After the Montecito models in the first half of 2006, the company will release a revamp code-named Montvale in the second half. The first three Montecitos, the single-core 1.6GHz 9010, dual-core 1.4GHz 9020 and dual-core 1.6GHz 9040, will get a Foxton bump to 1.8GHz, 1.6GHz and 1.8GHz, respectively, the road map said. The 9020 and 9040 have 18MB of on-board high-speed cache memory, while the 9010 has 6MB, according to the road map. In addition, Intel is working on a low-voltage dual-core Montecito model, the 9018, with a speed of 1.2GHz, a Foxton boost up to 1.4GHz, 12MB of cache and a 400MHz bus, the road map said. It's also due in the second quarter and consumes a maximum of 62 watts, considerably less than the 130-watt peak of the higher-end Itanium models. The top-end Montecito In the second quarter, a new top-end Itanium is expected: the 1.8GHz 9055, with 24MB of cache and a Foxton boost up to 2GHz, the top speed Intel has so far given for the chip. In the second quarter, the 9010, 9020 and 9040 also will get a faster front-side bus--the connection between the chip and the rest of the system--that runs at 667MHz compared with 400MHz and 533MHz for the first-quarter Montecito models. Those new versions will be called the 9011, 9021 and 9041, the road map said. And though Montecito is a dual-core design, Intel will ship new single-core models in the second quarter, the 9010 and 9011 that run at 1.6GHz, have 6MB of cache, and are boosted to 1.8GHz with Foxton. The 9011 differs from the 9010 in its support of the faster front-side bus. In the midrange, the 9030 and 9031 will run at 1.7GHz, include 8MB of cache and have a Foxton kicker to 1.8GHz. The 9031 supports the higher-speed bus. Dempsey leads Xeon debut Intel announced its first dual-core Xeon on Monday, a model code-named Paxville geared for dual-processor servers. But the real mainstream dual-core onslaught begins with "Dempsey" beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Dempsey models will be part of the 5000 series of Xeons, and at least six models, all with dual 2MB caches, will debut in the first quarter. In order of high-end to low-end, they are, according to the road map: The 5070, which has a clock speed of 3.46GHz, a front-side bus running at 1066MHz and a price in units of 1,000 of $851. The 5060, which is 3.2GHz with a 1066MHz bus and a $690 price tag. The 5050--3GHz with a 667MHz bus and a price of $455. The 5040--2.83GHz with a 667MHz bus and a $316 price. The 5030, which is 2.66GHz with a 667MHz bus and a $256 price. The 5020--2.5GHz with a 667MHz bus and $209 price. The top-end Dempsey clock speeds are a notch faster that the 3GHz maximum Intel described Monday at the Paxville launch. Dual-core Xeons coming sooner at the high end The version of Paxville for dual-processor servers is available now, but the chip was originally designed for the servers with four or more processors. According to the road map, there are four such models arriving soon, all members of the 7000 series. The top-end 7041 runs at 3GHz with an 800MHz bus speed, dual 2MB caches and a $3,157 price starting Nov. 1, according to the road map. The 7040 is the same but with a 667MHz bus speed. The 7030 has a clock speed of 2.8GHz, an 800MHz bus speed, dual 1MB caches and a $1,980 price. The 7020 has a speed of 2.66Ghz, a 667MHz bus, dual 1MB caches and a $1,177 price, according to the road map. Paxville's successor, code-named Tulsa, will come with as much as 16MB of cache, the road map said. Kai Schmerer of ZDNet Germany reported from Munich.
2003-04-23 - Intel plans Itanium course correction  Intel will release software later this year designed to dramatically improve how well its Itanium chips run programs written for its Pentium or Xeon processors, CNET News.com has learned. The move is meant to address a weakness that hampered the adoption of high-end, Itanium-based systems. Itanium chips currently include circuitry that lets them run the 32-bit software of "IA-32" processors such as Xeon or Pentium. But that circuitry's performance has been so poor that not even Intel advocates its use. The new software approach, called the IA-32 Execution Layer and code-named btrans, will give the forthcoming 1.5GHz Itanium 2 the ability to run 32-bit software about as fast as a 1.5GHz Xeon MP, Intel spokeswoman Barbara Grimes confirmed. The software could make Itanium processors more appealing to customers that have been reluctant to use Itanium systems because of the difficulty of running older 32-bit software, analysts said. In addition, Intel's new strategy could undermine one of the key advantages of the Opteron processor AMD introduced Tuesday because it allows customers to gradually transition to new applications without having to discard their current applications. AMD's Opteron is designed to run 32-bit code as fast as possible, meaning current applications don't need to be replaced. Itanium, on the other hand, emphasizes 64-bit software with the ability to run older 32-bit software as only a second priority. With both Opteron and Itanium, the software must be rebuilt if it is to take advantage of the 64-bit features, such as the ability to address large amounts of memory. "A customer who likes Itanium but also has 32-bit workloads they can't move immediately to Itanium is really in a quandary. AMD's claim to fame is that you can run that 32-bit software till the cows come home and have 64 bits, too," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. However, Intel's software emulation technology "does blunt AMD's story a bit," he said. The emulation software's speed, if it meets Intel's expectations, wouldn't be far behind the top 2GHz speed of today's Xeon MP, a chip that like Itanium is designed for multiprocessor servers. It would lag more substantially behind the speed of 3.06GHz Xeons for dual-processor computers, though. Still, it would be vastly better than the current technology for executing software for IA-32, also called x86 after earlier Intel processors such as the 386 and 486. "They said Itanium would never be their fastest 32-bit processor, but it would be in the ballpark. The original x86 hardware execution mechanism wasn't in the ballpark. It was barely in the parking lot around the ballpark," Brookwood said. Special Report Semi survival Soaring costs recast the chipmaking industry. The emulation move is also likely to be more palatable to customers than "Yamhill," an Intel project that sources have said is similar to AMD's 64-bit extensions to Intel's 32-bit design rather than the dramatic departure Itanium represents. "This could be another way to respond to AMD without necessarily compromising their Itanium strategy," Brookwood said. There are risks, though. Emulating one chip on another has historically been difficult and is most often used as a crutch during migrations, such as when Digital Equipment switched from VAX microprocessors to the Alpha. Apple managed the feat when it moved its computers from Motorola's 68000 line of processors to its PowerPC line, but could do so only because the new chip represented such a performance bump that it could offset some of the performance hit caused by running an emulator. Intel's Execution Layer software is a module that plugs into an operating system and emulates the IA-32 processor, Grimes said. Intel is working with Microsoft and Linux sellers on having the software included in their operating systems. Microsoft and top Linux seller Red Hat didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. SuSE declined to comment, but a source at the company said the second-largest Linux seller is working to support the technology. "We are working with Microsoft, with the Linux (project) maintainers and Linux operating system distributors to ensure the Execution Layer is functional and ready for quick, broad deployment when it's validated," Grimes said. The Itanium effort Itanium is an ambitious attempt to create a chip architecture that will last for more than a decade. Hewlett-Packard initiated the project in 1988 then signed a partnership with Intel to design and manufacture the chip in an effort to spread the processor as widely as Pentium instead of seeing it consigned to the small niche many high-end processors occupy. But the Itanium family arrived years later than expected, in the midst of an industry spending freeze, and the family's first member, code-named Merced, was largely a dud. Although the second-generation Itanium solved performance problems, it didn't change the larger problem: that software has to be rebuilt to take advantage of the chip's abilities. And because the anemic 32-bit performance made it hard to run older software, Intel rivals such as AMD and Sun Microsystems were able to exploit the fact that their new chips don't force customers to deal with a "binary break" that makes older software useless. And that led Intel to consider emulation technology. "If Intel could find a way to have IA-32 code run reliably and relatively quickly on an Itanium processor, it could only help its adoption," said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. HP, the company with the biggest stake in the success of Itanium--because it's moving its entire server line to the chip family--is supportive of the move. "We're pleased with any technology that will boost the performance of Itanium-based systems for our customers. We expect this (IA-32 Execution Layer) to help customers as they migrate their applications from 32-bit to 64-bit on Windows and Linux," said Brian Cox, worldwide product line manager for HP Business Critical Systems. Intel will keep the hardware-based IA-32 support at least through the Itanium II 9M model due to arrive in 2004, Grimes said. She declined to say whether the company would rely solely on the Execution Layer software after that, but analysts believe that move is likely. Removing the hardware component likely would liberate Itanium from design compromises the chip needed to accommodate the 32-bit code, Brookwood said. And Mercury Research analyst Dean McCarron noted that "getting rid of the hardware piece of it means fewer transistors, smaller die size, and (that Itanium would be) more manufacturable." Grimes, however, said removing the hardware support wouldn't change the processor size significantly. Several factors will determine the future of the emulation layer. On one hand, Intel engineers could improve the software in succeeding generations, and its performance will increase as newer, faster Itanium models debut. On the other hand, Intel has been aggressively boosting the speeds of its 32-bit chips. One advantage of the emulation software is that it can be more easily adapted to execute IA-32 instructions that older IA-32 chips lacked. For example, the existing Itanium circuitry can't execute the SSE instructions that have been boosting some mathematical operations since the days of Pentium III, much less the SSE2 follow-on in Pentium 4 and whatever might come later. The new layer doesn't change Intel's overall Itanium strategy of encouraging computing companies to rebuild their software for Itanium, Grimes said. Customers needing top 32-bit software performance should still buy Xeon systems, she said. "Itanium is first and foremost designed to run 64-bit," Grimes said. "The 32-bit support is in there as a migration path for people as they get over to 64-bit, or for nonperformance (critical) applications they might not want to migrate."
2008-02-04 - Intel pitching Silverthorne Itanium at ISSCC   Intel is expected to shed light on its processor of the future this week as it plugs along with another design that was once supposed to be its processor of the future.The chip industry's finest minds will be descending on San Francisco this week for the International Solid State Circuits Conference, and Intel plans to present 14 papers highlighting some of its recent work, said Justin Rattner, Intel's chief technology officer and head of Intel Labs. Chief among them will be its low-power Silverthorne processor, Intel's latest plan to infiltrate the world of handheld devices. "This is the smallest (x86 instruction set) processor we've built in the last 15 to 17 years," Rattner said, speaking of Silverthorne in a briefing for reporters prior to the conference. Silverthorne is expected to arrive in the second quarter in so-called mobile Internet devices, but it's really a stepping stone for Intel toward a lower-power future. The ultimate goal for Intel is to design a chip that will fit into the next generation of mobile devices and smartphones, carving out a niche for PC software and programming techniques in a world dominated by chip designer ARM and its partners, such as Texas Instruments and Samsung. With a power consumption range between half a watt and two watts, Silverthorne doesn't quite fit into the appropriate thermal profile occupied by those chips. But it can run any piece of software written for PCs at the performance level achieved by one of Intel's 5-year-old Pentium M processors. Silverthorne is a departure from the rest of Intel's designs in that it's an in-order processor, as opposed to the out-of-order design used in just about every other chip the company makes. That means pretty much what it sounds like; in-order chips have to process tasks in a defined order, but out-of-order chips can process tasks separately and reassemble a finished product later. Out-of-order means better performance, in-order generally means lower power consumption. The chip also incorporates a new low-power state, allowing it to essentially shut down in between processing tasks and limit power consumption. And just in case the software industry starts producing more multithreaded applications, Intel added an old friend, hyperthreading, to Silverthorne. Hyperthreading allows Silverthorne to present itself as a dual-core chip to software, even though it only has one physical processing core. While Silverthorne is considered a huge part of Intel's future, Tukwilla, the other major design being presented at ISSCC, is a remmant of Intel's past. Tukwilla will be the next version of the Itanium processor, which Intel once thought could take over the server industry but has been relegated instead to a high-end niche. Still, that's a powerful niche. Tukwilla will be the first quad-core Itanium processor, and it will use a whopping 30MBs of cache memory. This is going to be a high-performance (read: expensive) chip for high-end servers, and it will also be one of Intel's first chips that borrows design techniques employed by Intel's rival, Advanced Micro Devices, to great effect. Tukwilla will use point-to-point connection technology that Intel calls Quickpath to directly link processing cores together. AMD introduced this way back in 2003 with its Opteron processor, and it delivers a significant boost in performance as the chip industry moves into the multicore era. Intel's current designs required signals traveling between two different processor cores to leave, then re-enter, the chip. Quickpath lets those signals stay on the chip, allowing them to travel a shorter distance at higher speeds. That's good. Tukwilla will also use an integrated memory controller, which is a similar concept. Integrated memory controllers, as the name implies, are integrated directly onto the chip. This allows this vital link between the processor and the main memory to run at the speed of the chip, rather than the slower speeds necessitated by the front-side bus design used by Intel's chips. Intel eventually plans to bring Quickpath and integrated memory controllers down to its Xeon line of server processors, which go into the vast majority of the world's servers. That will arrive with the Nehalem generation of chips, due out later in 2008. Intel's researchers also plan to present papers in other areas, such as wireless technologies and memory research. The company has been working on radios that can employ multiple protocols, from Wi-Fi and WiMax to even cellular standards, and it plans to highlight some research in this area. The company is also investigating phase-change memory, one possible way to prepare for the end of Moore's Law by discovering ways to represent the fundamental zeros and ones of computing with something other than a transistor. These presentations are not for the faint of heart. An electrical engineering degree would be very helpful in deciphering the papers, although not exactly required. We'll be on hand during the week to highlight some of the more interesting presentations, especially Silverthorne, which is a key part of Intel's future plans.
2004-02-17 - Intel offers peek at future chips  Intel will give a glimpse of what the insides of computers might look like in a few years when it presents research results at a conference this week. Researchers from the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker will present papers at the International Solid State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) in San Francisco that will describe, among other projects, a low-power, high-speed arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that can run both 32-bit and 64-bit code. This, in turn, could allow the company to make Pentium-class chips that could run both types of software. The ALU churns calculations with whole numbers instead of decimals. Another paper will outline an input-output protocol that moves data at 8 gigabits per second in a parallel fashion that could replace some internal links inside PCs in a few years. Current parallel links move much slower. A third paper, filed in conjunction with memory makers Samsung and Infineon, will show how memory can be linked in a different manner inside PCs to speed up data traffic. Other papers will detail how Intel has made high-speed oscillators, a key component for radios, out of silicon. Typically, these are made from exotic materials such as Indium Phosphide. By 2005, Intel hopes to be producing silicon radios and, eventually, radios that can roam between different bands, said Krishnamurthy Soumyanath, director of communications circuits research at the company. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. There is no guarantee that any of these exact inventions will get embodied in future products, said Shekhar Borkar, director of circuit research at Intel. In the past, however, inventions and ideas described in papers at this conference often wind up in the market in a few years. The ALU runs at more than 7GHz in 32-bit mode and at 4GHz in 64-bit mode. Compared with existing Intel ALUs, the prototype unit increases performance by 20 percent and reduces power consumption by 56 percent, Borkar said. In the Pentium 4 family, the ALU runs at twice the speed of the chip, so the part would fit into a Pentium 4 style chip that would run at 3.5GHz. The ALU, made on the 90-nanometer process, could be inserted into either Pentium-class chips (so they could run 64-bit software) or Itanium chips (so they could run standard Windows code better), said sources close to the company. The company is looking at a few different ALUs, sources said. Borkar declined to comment on product plans, but said it could go into a next-generation Pentium-style chip. While the ALU would improve processor performance, the paper on memory describes a way to cure one of the chronic bottlenecks inside computers: getting data in and out of memory. In the Intel-Samsung-Infineon proposal, memory chips would shuttle data between one other at 3.6 gigabits per second and then to a memory controller, which would feed data to a processor. This would allow data stored in memory chips physically remote from the processor to get to the intended destination more rapidly. Advanced Micro Devices already uses similar "point-to-point" connections, called HyperTransport, with its Opteron chip. The high-speed link, however, connects the processor to other processors or central communication hubs. Memory chips do not connect directly to one other.
2001-08-29 - Intel offers details on future Itanium chips   SAN JOSE, Calif.--Intel is coming out with new versions of its Itanium chip--a slow seller so far--that the company says will provide far faster performance. The next version of Itanium, code-named McKinley, will be "able to realize a 1.5x to 2x performance gain very readily" over the current generation when it comes out in test systems later this year, according to Abhi Talwalker, vice president of the server products division at Intel. The boost comes from a much faster bus, additional microstructures and a more efficient 3MB memory cache located on the processor, he said. A year after that, a follow-on known as Madison will upstage McKinley by featuring a fairly massive 6MB cache integrated into the processor and even higher clock speeds, Talwalker said. Itanium is Intel's 64-bit server chip. Released earlier this year, Itanium and the servers and workstations that contain it largely compete against hardware from Sun Microsystems. The Itanium differs from Intel's desktop chips because, among other things, it processes data in 64 bits at a time rather than 32. Because of a number of delays, the first version of Itanium, code-named Merced, has largely been used as a test vehicle. "Merced was kind of a flop" commercially, said Jon Joseph, semiconductor analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Despite delays with Merced, its progeny are following in quick succession. Prototype servers containing McKinley will begin to appear later this year. Commercial systems will arrive in 2002, said Talwalker. McKinley gets its power from a generous helping of circuitry. In all, it will sport 220 million transistors, or about five times more than the Pentium 4, and will come with a 400MHz bus that is 128 bits wide. Itanium, by contrast, sports a 266MHz bus that is 64 bits wide, according to Talwalker. Typically, increasing the speed and width of the bus--the main data conduit connecting the processor to main memory--leads to greater performance. With McKinley, Intel also has increased the number of integer units, which perform basic calculations, from four to six. In addition, the chip will come with 11 instruction cores, two more than the current Itanium. Talwalker declined to state the speed at which McKinley will run but said it will be faster than the current Itanium, which runs at 800MHz. McKinley also comes with a more efficient Level 3 cache. Cache memory is near the processor and holds data that needs to be accessed rapidly. Current Itanium chips come with 2MB to 4MB of Level 3 cache. The tertiary cache, however, is not integrated into the processor but sits on separate chips next to the main chip. McKinley will come with caches ranging in size from 1.5MB to 3MB, integrated into the processor. While smaller, the caches on McKinley will likely lead to higher performance. Integration essentially allows data to reach the processor more rapidly by cutting down the electron commute. The new chip also will allow computer makers to build systems with more than 1,000 processors, Talwalker said. Current Itaniums can be melded into 512-processor systems. In 2003, Madison will raise the cache quotient. Versions of Madison for eight- and 16-processor servers will come with 6MB caches, while versions for smaller servers and workstations will come with caches ranging from 3MB to 6MB. A yet later successor to Itanium, known as Deerfield, which also comes out in 2003, will be aimed at the "dense server" market. Dense servers typically measure 3.5 inches in height or less. Deerfield will be built around the same basic architecture as Madison and McKinley, but it will consume far less power and produce less heat, according to Talwalker. The chip will appear mostly in two-processor servers. Although Intel typically declines to comment on its competitors, it often makes an exception when it comes to Sun, which rocketed to financial success with the emergence of the Internet. Since then, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and the rest of the old guard of computing have worked overtime to take a chunk of Sun's business. Besides touting the performance of the chip, Intel will also attack Sun on costs. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker has repeatedly said that servers based on Itanium will be much less expensive than their Sun counterparts, an important consideration in a recessionary market. Itanium servers can cut hardware costs by 40 percent to 50 percent in some instances, according to Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel Architecture Group. "The IT managers are absolutely compelled to take a look at the situation," he said. Overall, the actual number of Itanium chips shipped will be small compared with the company's other processors, said Salomon's Joseph. However, the chips will allow the company to get a foot in the lucrative "high ground" of back-end computing.
2002-11-27 - Intel Next Itanium to run at 15GHz The new chip, code-named Madison, is similar to its Itanium 2 "McKinley" predecessor but is built with smaller circuitry that permits faster processing and more built-in high-speed "cache" memory. Intel disclosed the 1.5GHz speed in an agenda for a February processor show, the International Solid-State Circuits Conference. "This is a demonstration that Intel is continuing to execute with precision, which is good" and very much a turnaround from the first-generation "Merced" version of Itanium, said Nathan Brookwood, an Insight64 analyst. "The Merced program was plagued with a variety of gremlins, but the McKinley and Madison programs have executed pretty smoothly." Intel's ability to crank out new, faster versions of Itanium each year is a key part of its argument that it can use its manufacturing expertise to take on IBM, Sun Microsystems and Advanced Micro Devices, each of which have their own server processors. Intel must meet a higher standard for Itanium to catch on because adopting the new chip requires companies to completely rewrite their software. "That's a pretty furious pace in the server business--a new part every year. It's much faster than what the other vendors are doing," said Kevin Krewell, senior editor at the Microprocessor Report. Improving technology is critical for Intel, but it's not the only requirement for the ultimate success of Itanium. It will take years to develop all the necessary software for the Itanium line, which uses completely different instructions than Intel's Pentium family; the first major server version of Windows for Itanium is scheduled to arrive in April 2003. Some analysts expect Intel server sales to lag competing designs through at least 2007, while others expect Itanium chips will only start shipping in volume with Madison. The Itanium processor line, co-developed with Hewlett-Packard, has a 64-bit design that can accommodate the vast amounts of memory needed for large databases. Other features protect against data transfer errors and make the chip well suited to large servers with numerous processors. Pentium and Xeon processors, 32-bit designs, have a much smaller 4GB memory limit. AMD, whose chips are compatible with the Pentium line, is taking a different design course than Intel, working on a chip called Opteron that has 64-bit extensions but can still run all the software of the 32-bit family. Intel said the size of each Madison will be 374 square millimeters, will consume a maximum of 130 watts, and will have 410 million transistors, the basic circuitry elements out of which chips are assembled. Until now, Intel had said only that the processor would have "about half a billion" transistors. Intel confirmed Tuesday that the chip measurements disclosed in the conference agenda are what's expected for the final version of Madison, expected in the summer of 2003. "Those numbers are certainly what we expect and what we are targeting," Intel spokesman Seth Walker said. With the clock speed increase and the doubling of cache size from 3MB on the current Itanium 2 to 6MB on Madison, Intel expects overall server performance to increase about 50 percent compared with Itanium 2, with overall system costs staying about the same. Big bucks for small chips The 374 square millimeter "die" size is a bit smaller than the 421 square millimeter size of Itanium 2, but still is large and therefore pricey. The larger the chip size, the fewer chips can be carved from each slice of silicon. "It's big," said Dean McCarron, a Mercury Research analyst. "But because it's a server product, that kind of die size is acceptable. It'll sell for thousands of dollars. With that kind of price tag, you can afford to have a really large die." Intel declined to comment on pricing, but Insight64's Brookwood expects the cost to stay about the same as the $4,226 price of the current Itanium 2 and the $4,227 first-generation Itanium. "What they've done with the Xeon and Itanium line is that each new generation of chips is using exactly the same price," he said. Server chips--larger and with more features--don't run as fast as desktop models. The Pentium 4 currently tops out at 3GHz, for example. But server chips have different design goals. "Where you're focusing on a more complex architecture...you may not run it as fast, but you're doing more work per each cycle," McCarron said. Itaniums can execute about six instructions per clock cycle, compared with one or two for Pentium processors, he said. The Microprocessor Report's Krewell, who expected Madison to run between 1.4GHz and 1.6Ghz, believes Intel may have been able to get Madison to run faster but would have run into problems with overheating that would have undermined one of the key selling points of the chip: easy upgrades. Madison and its successor "Montecito" will both plug directly into servers that accommodate the current Itanium 2 processors. That makes it easier for server designers--of which there are several--to build machines that won't be obsolete in a year. A key part of that promise is that the newer chips won't consume more power than the original Itanium 2. "The goal is to show that within a fixed infrastructure of 130 watts, Intel can take it from McKinley to Madison," Krewell said. Intel has said Madison will sport a variation of the Itanium 2 name. The first Itanium 2 was built with a manufacturing process that used circuit features as small as 180 nanometers, or billionths of a meter. Madison uses the 130-nanometer process of the current Pentium 4, which permits more transistors for a given amount of silicon. Montecito, due in 2004, will use a 90-nanometer process still under development. With the cache size and clock speed increases, Brookwood expects Madison to beat current Itanium 2 chips by about 50 percent on the much-watched SPECint2000 speed test. AMD's Opteron, also due in mid-2003, will have a SPECint2000 score of about 1,202, AMD projected in October. The current 1GHz Itanium 2 posts a score of about 810, and a 2.8GHz Xeon tops the chart at 1,032. With Madison and faster Xeons on the way, Intel should be able to meet AMD in the speed race, Brookwood said. "All three architectures will have very similar SPECint numbers," he said. "The two suppliers will be neck and neck."
2005-03-02 - Intel names top Itanium target IBM SAN FRANCISCO--Intel and IBM have long had competing processors for the server market, but Intel executives on Tuesday began overtly naming Big Blue as the prime target of the Itanium processor family. Pat Gelsinger and Abhi Talwalkar, who jointly lead the digital enterprise group, called out IBM's Power processor as Itanium's chief foe more than once during speeches at the Intel Developer Forum here. The move came a week after IBM acknowledged that it has stopped designing the server components at the heart of its own Itanium servers. "It's a two-horse race. It's Power and Itanium," Gelsinger said. "It's not particularly surprising they're not pursuing Itanium when their motivation is Power." And Talwalkar said of Itanium that "the primary focus and competition is primarily Power." It's not exactly bare-knuckle boxing, but the words were strong given the close partnership between the companies for use of Intel's other server processor, Xeon, a close relative of Pentium. "For Intel, that was foaming at the mouth," said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. IBM didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Intel missed its Itanium shipment goals for 2004, but the company is still investing in the technology, arguing that a "one size fits all" approach employing only x86 chips such as Pentium and Xeon wouldn't work to take on Power and another competitor, Sparc chips from Sun Microsystems and Fujitsu. To telegraph the company's Itanium commitment, Gelsinger also revealed a new high-end Itanium processor code-named Poulson. Gelsinger offered almost no details about Poulson other than the fact that it would arrive after the 2007 Itanium version code-named Tukwila and would fit into the Tukwila server platform, code-named Richford. But he did say it would depart significantly from Tukwila. "It's not just a minor revision. It will be a major development," Gelsinger said. Intel's roadmap for Xeon Also at the show, Intel released a large dose of plans for its Xeon server processors through 2007. The plans included both classes of Xeons, the DP models for dual-processor machines and the MP models for servers with four or more processors. "They've got some confidence again in what they're doing," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. One of the reason Intel didn't share them in the past: "I think they were unsure where they were going." Intel's new roadmaps correspond to the chipmaker's new focus on platforms--the combination of a processor and the chipset that connects the processor to memory and other computer subsystems. Previously, the processor and chipsets were developed separately, but the company has merged the work to try to better meet customer needs. The nearest-term Xeon products are MP models that are part of the Truland platform arriving in coming weeks. The higher-end Potomac version of Xeon will have as much as 8MB of high-speed cache memory, Gelsinger said in an interview. It will be mated to a lower-end Cranford model with less cache. The Truland systems will be the first time the 64-bit memory addressing technology arrives in the Xeon MP line. The chips also come with demand-based switching, which saves power by slowing the processor when it's idle. Truland will be updated in 2005 and 2006 with new models code-named Paxville and Tulsa, Gelsinger said. These models will be dual-core designs with two processing engines on one slice of silicon. Then in 2007, a new Xeon MP platform will be introduced, code-named Reidland and using a processor code-named Whitefield employing more than two cores. For the Xeon DP line--where the bulk of Intel's Xeon sales take place--dual-core chips will arrive sooner. The Bensley platform is scheduled to arrive in the first quarter of 2006 with a processor code-namd Dempsey and a chipset code-named Blackford. A variation of Bensley called Glidewell also will be available for workstations. Gelsinger demonstrated a Bensley system Tuesday. Bensley and Glidewell will debut three new Intel technologies: Intel Virtualizatoin Technology to run multiple operating systems simultaneously; Input/Output Acceleration Technology (I/OAT) to speed networking; and Intel Advanced Management Technology (IAMT) to ease remote control of computers.
1999-10-04 - Intel names Merced chip Itanium    Itanium--think "Titanium" with a slight regional accent--will be the official name of Intel's Merced processor, and the company will provide more details on the chip's microarchitecture at the Microprocessor Forum in San Jose, California, tomorrow. The name Itanium was chosen to "reflect the strength and performance of the processor," said Jami Dover, vice president of marketing at Intel. Sausalito, California-based Lexicon, which also coined the chip names Celeron and Xeon, came up with the name, she said. Itanium, due toward the middle of next year, will be the chipmaker's first 64-bit processor, which means that the chip can process information in 64-bit chunks. Current Intel processors work with 32-bit chunks. The processor will allow Intel to provide the building blocks for servers that compete against the expensive "big iron" servers currently sold by Sun and others. Itanium-based systems will largely be targeted to e-commerce applications and to Internet service providers. Although Intel has not officially released the speed or price of the chip, it will provide details about the internal structure of the chip tomorrow, according to Steve Smith, vice president and general manager of the IA-64 division. If anything, the structure of the chip makes it apparent that the processor will indeed be more powerful than any previous Intel processor, he said. The Itanium will be capable, theoretically, of performing at six gigaflops, or performing six billion operations per second, Smith said. The chip will include 4 integer units and 2 floating point units, two internal structures integral to mathematical calculations. In addition, Itanium will come with up to 4MB of secondary cache memory, Intel said. Cache serves as a data reservoir for the processor and enhances performance. Current Intel Xeon chips top out at 2MB of cache. In its package, the chip is slightly smaller than a 3 x 5 index card. To complement the chip, Intel will also produce the 460GX chipset, which will work with standard 100-MHz memory, the company said. Initially, the Itanium will not be geared to work with next generation Rambus memory. Server builders typically are more concerned with the amount, rather than the speed, of memory, and using standard memory initially will allow them to pack much more memory into their systems. Intel is currently having trouble with its 820 chipset, which is the first to use Rambus memory. More "Coppermine" details Intel will also use the Microprocessor Forum to provide more details on its "Coppermine" Pentium III processor, which is expected on October 25. Coppermine differs from current Pentium IIIs in that it will contain 256KB of integrated secondary cache on the same silicon as the processor. Current Pentium IIIs come with 512KB of cache, but the cache is on separate chips. Although smaller, the integrated cache will boost performance and help Intel close the performance gap between the Pentium III family and AMD's recently released Athlon chips. Overall, Intel states that its own benchmarks show that Coppermine outperforms standard Pentium IIIs in 3D tests by 13 to 23 percent. The new Coppermines are expected to run at 700 MHz, with a 733-MHz version coming soon after. Mobile versions of the chip running at 500 MHz will also be released. Coppermine processors will also come with a 133-MHz system bus, which is the main conduit between the processor and the rest of the computer. Most Intel system buses today run at 100 MHz. Later, Coppermine chips will work with Rambus memory.
2002-01-25 - Intel moves forward on Itanium backup  Intel is reportedly working on a long-rumored project to develop an emergency backup plan for the high-end server market in the event its Itanium processor fails to take off. The company is looking at building capabilities into the next version of the Pentium family, code-named Prescott, that will allow the chip to run 32-bit applications, the same sort of applications that currently run on Windows machines, as well as 64-bit versions of those applications, according to a report in The San Jose Mercury News. Sixty-four bits is the amount of data the chip can process during one clock cycle. Overall, 64-bit chips can greatly improve performance and are necessary for applications such as data mining. It's unclear if such a 32-64 bit chip would ever hit the market, or even if it's technically feasible to add such features into Prescott, according to analysts. Intel engineers, though, are tinkering with the concept, according to the Mercury News and Ashok Kumar, an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. An Intel representative declined to comment on unannounced products but said that the company in general maintains backup plans. "There are any number of plan Bs," said a representative, adding, "Itanium is the basis of an architecture that will span more than two decades." Arcane as it sounds, the release of a chip with those capabilities would be a significant event in the server world. Intel currently promotes its Itanium processor for servers that run 64-bit applications. These servers are supposed to compete against similar 64-bit machines from Sun Microsystems. Delays, uninspiring performance, and a lack of applications, however, have combined to make Itanium sales anemic. A Pentium chip with so-called 64-bit extensions would be compatible with the existing Windows server software, which would ease commercial adoption. Such a chip would also stem interest in Hammer, the code name for a 32-64 bit chip from Advanced Micro Devices. AMD Chief Executive Jerry Sanders has called such a chip from Intel "my biggest fear." Since last November, computer executives and analysts have said Intel would inevitably try to develop such a chip. Some computer companies have even actively encouraged Intel to put greater emphasis on a 32-64 chip. The existence or status of any projects has continued to be vague. Of course, such a chip would face an uphill climb in getting to the market, according to analysts. Intel has spent massive amounts of time, energy and money building the Itanium. Suddenly offering an alternative chip that would be more widely compatible with the world's software would drastically undercut those efforts. "It makes a lot of sense for them to do it, but there is zero incentive," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. "It could happen if AMD starts getting credible positioning in the entry-level server space with Hammer." Technically, integrating such capabilities into Prescott, due out in late 2003 or early 2004, would not be easy either. "I'd be real surprised if they could drop it in without a major overhaul," said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64. This chip would also require both hardware makers and software developers to come up with products that would be able to take advantage of the 32-64 bit design. Some of these companies, including IBM and Hewlett-Packard, have already invested substantial amounts in Itanium projects. Despite the obstacles, the chip would have at least one strong argument in its favor: Interest in Itanium remains weak. The first version of the chip debuted in May of last year. In the third quarter of 2001, only 500 servers containing Itanium were shipped, according to IDC. McKinley, a new version of the chip, is currently being launched on a test basis and will come out commercially in the middle of 2002. McKinley is expected to perform far better than the current versions of Itanium. Questionable demand Nonetheless, demand remains fairly uncertain. Compaq Computer executives, for instance, have said that companies will spend most of 2002 trying to popularize Itanium, with volume sales beginning in 2003 and 2004, when the successors to McKinley, called Madison and Deerfield, arrive. ServerWorks, which manufactures chipsets for Intel servers, said it likely won't come out with Itanium-compatible parts until Deerfield. "We're just waiting for volume to materialize," said Kimball Brown, vice president of business development at ServerWorks. A major stumbling block for Itanium has been a lack of applications. The chip is built around an entirely new architecture, which goes by the acronym EPIC, that requires brand-new software. Itanium chips can actually run standard Windows programs; the chip includes an integrated Pentium chip. Performance, however, is not very good, according to most analysts and computer experts. Although many new Itanium applications are expected to arrive with McKinley, the software available will be dwarfed by the number of servers with standard Intel chips. Software developers also don't have the dollars to invest in Itanium programs right now. Customer interest for Itanium servers is "effectively zero," Joe Marengi, senior vice president of Dell Americas, said in an interview in November at Comdex. "The investment involved in the transition is huge." At the time, Marengi suggested that one could argue the relative merits of a hypothetical 32-64 bit chip. Few companies have ever successfully switched from one architecture to another. Intel, in fact, attempted to switch from its "x86" architecture, the architecture behind its microprocessors, in the early '80s. Many of the company's best designers were put on the Sierra project, a chip based around a budding new architecture that would succeed the 286 chip, according to Brookwood. In the end, however, the company went with its plan B, an extension of the 286 called the 386. Pat Gelsinger, one of the leaders on the 386 project, has since become Intel's CTO. Ironically, Intel contemplated doing a 32-64 bit chip in the early '90s, according to former company executives, but decided to concentrate on chips based around the then-emerging EPIC architecture.
2003-11-16 - Intel moves deeper into supercomputing Intel plans to dedicate $36 million for basic research to improving the performance of supercomputers made from off-the-shelf parts as it continues to expand its reach in the very high end of the computer market. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company will be a visible presence this week at the SC2003 supercomputing conference taking place in Phoenix. Along with the announcement of the research effort, called the Advanced Computing Program, Intel will discuss how Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is erecting a cluster, code-named Thunder, that will contain 3,840 1.4GHz, 4MB Itanium 2 processors and is expected to be one of the fastest computers in the world. It is slated to be completed in December. At 20 teraflops, or 20 trillion floating-point calculations per second, Thunder would be the second-fastest supercomputer in the world if it were running now, following NEC's Earth Simulator, said Rick Herrmann, high-performance computing program office manager at Intel. Intel-based computers account for four of the top 10 computers on the latest Top500 supercomputing list, which was released Sunday, and for 189 computers total on the list. A year ago, only 56 computers on the list ran on Intel chips. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. Of the Top 500 systems on the new list, 32 contain chips from Intel's Itanium family, up from 19 six month ago. Call it the democratization of the supercomputer. Years ago, the market was a province of huge multinationals such as IBM or specialists such as Cray because supercomputers were largely customized beasts that often required years to build. Now, because of improved clustering, which allows researchers to stitch hundreds or thousands of commercially available servers into a functional supercomputer, and ever-increasing processor performance, a variety of companies are now making supercomputer-class machines. The basic building block of the Thunder cluster, for instance, is a four-processor, Itanium 2 server from California Digital. The machine is expected to take only five months to build from concept to final installation. A cluster of Apple Computer desktops put together by Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University ranks as the third-fastest computer on the most recent list. "We don't think it is an and/or equation. There is a place for customized solutions, but there is also a need for off-the-shelf systems," Herrmann said. "The performance of computers with off-the-shelf components intersected with specialized machines in the 2001-2002 time frame." To continue to increase the popularity of these types of systems, Intel will use the $36 million in the Advanced Computing Program to iron out some of the lingering technological limitations found in large computers fashioned from off-the-shelf parts. The research effort, which will involve server makers and universities, will revolve around such issues as increasing parallelism in applications, reducing energy consumption and improving system management. "We're looking at three to five years from now (to see) what needs to be solved," Herrmann said. In other Intel server news, the company this week said momentum for its Itanium chip continues to increase. "We?ve gone from a handful of apps to 1,000," said Ajay Malhotra, general manager of enterprise marketing and planning at the company. Around 1,500 applications will be available, or in development, by the middle of next year. Malhotra also added that Montecito, a dual-core Itanium expected in 2005, will have 24MB of level 3 cache and contain multithreading, a feature now found on Pentium 4 and Xeon chips.
2001-06-27 - Intel makes strides with Tualatin chips    NEW YORK--Intel has moved forward in two major areas of the chipmaking process with "Tualatin," the new Pentium III processor the company showed off at the PC Expo trade show Wednesday. Tualatin, also known as Pentium III-M, will initially be used mainly in notebooks. Intel executives said all of the major notebook makers, including Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard, Dell Computer, Fujitsu and Sony, will adopt the new chip. Several have shown Tualatin-powered notebooks at PC Expo, part of the Technology Exchange Week New York event. Tualatin uses Intel's new 0.13-micron manufacturing process, which allows smaller circuits to be printed on the chip, thus increasing the processing power that can be squeezed onto a piece of silicon. Tualatin also marks Intel's entry into the chip industry's copper shift, using the metal to connect circuits on the chip. It's unusual for a chipmaker to make two major shifts with the same product, but Intel felt the time was right for both, Frank Spindler, vice president and general manager of Intel's Mobile Computing Group, said in a PC Expo interview with CNET News.com. The 0.13-micron manufacturing process essentially shrinks the size of processor features from the current 0.18-micron process. That means faster chips that consume less power. "We think everything about the 0.13-micron technology is significant," Spindler said. The move to copper interconnects--the metal wires that connect transistors--also promises faster clock speeds. Intel is the last large chipmaker to switch to copper, after Advanced Micro Devices, IBM and Motorola. Spindler said that Intel, which takes an incremental approach to adding new technologies to its chips, didn't feel it needed copper right away. "We have found that other companies will highlight a particular technology like copper because it helps them overcome architectural issues with their designs," Spindler said. "We're not trying to overcome a core weakness. "We waited until it provided a substantial benefit. It's going to help us get to higher frequencies, and it will help on the power" consumption. The incremental approach to new technologies boils down to "a lot of stuff over a long period of time," Spindler said, as opposed to creating a brand-new chip from the ground up. Gartner analyst Martin Reynolds says Intel's current challenge is moving the Pentium 4 into the IT mainstream. see commentary "It underscores the point that delivering performance and lower power is more than one magic thing," he said. Tualatin's speed and power advantages will initially be concentrated in laptops. Compaq announced a Tualatin-powered notebook at PC Expo that weighs 2.5 pounds and runs for eight hours on a battery charge. Notebooks, which continue to outdistance desktop PCs in sales growth, have become increasingly important to Intel as the PC market stalls. Tualatin will become Intel's new bread-and-butter processor for mobile. Despite the planned introduction of a mobile Pentium 4 next year, Tualatin will live through 2003 before Intel replaces it, company executives said. The first Tualatin chips are expected to range in clock speed from 866MHz to 1.13GHz when they debut late next month. Later, Intel will introduce low- and ultra-low-voltage versions of the chip. Compaq executives also said the company would adopt Pentium III-M in its Presario 1700 series later in the year. Workstation and server versions of Tualatin will be available later, but desktop PCs based on the chip are unlikely. Intel executives said the company is encouraging PC makers to use the chips only for consumer-oriented desktops, while relying on the Pentium 4 for corporate machines. Compaq, for one, says it's happy with its current mix of Pentium III, Pentium 4 and AMD Athlon processors. It will not offer Tualatin in consumer desktops. "Tualatin was attractive for notebooks, but we felt that we've got an AMD solution so that Tualatin didn't make a lot of sense" for consumer desktops, said Will Townsend, senior manager of marketing for retail desktops in Compaq's Consumer Products Group.

2002-10-23 - Intel looks to spread silicon "everywhere" Intel plans to place its silicon in as many products, markets and geographic regions as possible, the company said Tuesday. "Our goal is to drive Intel everywhere into the home," as well as the office and mobile environment, said Paul Otellini, Intel's president, who was speaking at the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker's fall financial briefing to investors. "We want to drive more Intel silicon into every computer." Business remains down, but the potential to expand still exists, executives said. While PCs will consume most of Intel's chips, the company's silicon will increasingly pop up in set-top boxes, personal video recorders, handheld devices and networking equipment, he said. Integration and bundling--tools the company has used for years to expand into new markets--will be pervasive. Intel said, for instance, it will sell its upcoming Banias notebook chip with a complementary chipset and with its first Wi-Fi chip. The whole package will be sold under a single brand name and allow Intel to sell three chips at once. Manitoba--a chip for handheld devices coming in the second half of 2003--will combine flash memory, a microprocessor and communications functions into one piece of silicon. Because integrated chips cost less than separate chips, Intel believes it can undercut competitors as well as sell a larger percentage of the total silicon. Processor performance will also improve, the company said. Madison, the next version of the Itanium server chip, is due out in 2003. It is expected to contain close to a half a billion transistors and provide 30 to 50 percent more performance than the current Itanium 2. As an added bonus, it will fit inside current Itanium 2 servers. "Customers can take that same design and get substantially higher performance," Otellini said. Around the world In terms of geographic regions, Intel said it will continue to expand its reach in emerging markets such as Russia, China, Brazil, India and Mexico, where PC growth is strongest. Those five countries, in fact, account for 17 percent of Intel's sales today, said Mike Splinter, executive vice president of sales and marketing. To reach these international markets, the company will need to create stronger relationships with dealers and system integrators, which wield substantial power in those markets. Currently, the company works with around 90,000 integrators, including 3,000 in Russia alone. Within five years, Intel expects the number to expand to 200,000. Meanwhile, in the United States the company said it will continue its push to take share in the server market with Xeon- and Itanium-based servers. The company said it met its internal goal for Intel-based server sales into the 1,000 largest global companies. Revenue remains fairly flat. In this environment, the company will continue to cut costs, said CFO Andy Bryant. Since the company's employment peak in the first quarter of 2001, total employee count is down 13 percent. Among other notes A 3GHz Pentium 4 will come out this quarter, Otellini said. Sources said it would launch Nov. 14. Prescott, the successor to the current version of the Pentium 4, is expected to feature a new version of hyperthreading, called HT2, while an accompanying chipset will come with a security technology called LaGrande that prevents outsiders from looking at data on a hard drive. Prescott is due in the second half of 2003. Intel plans to integrate "soft access points" for wireless access into PCs. This extra software will let home notebook users connect to the Internet by using a wired home PC as a bridge. This technology could help expand wireless home networking, Otellini said. A 2GHz Xeon for multiprocessor servers is due later this quarter. Itanium will contain multiple cores, or processing units, Otellini said. Next year, three operating systems, a number of applications and virtually all of the major databases will be running on Itanium.
2001-04-25 - Intel looks to software to lift Itanium    Intel is taking a new look at the software behind its processors to increase performance for future chips. Intel's Microprocessor Research Labs (MRL) established an alliance Wednesday aimed at increasing the performance of compilers for its long-awaited IA-64 processors for servers. The compiler plays a vital role by allowing operating systems, such as Microsoft's Windows, to interact with processors in the most efficient way. A well-tuned compiler is in Intel's best interest, since it can wring the highest performance out of new chips by allowing application software, such as Web servers and transaction processing systems, to take full advantage of a new processor's speed. The MRL, which is responsible for researching new processor designs five to eight years in advance, enlisted the Chinese Academy of Science near Beijing for help with the compiler project. The goal of the project is to augment existing compilers, such as Silicon Graphics' compiler for IA-64 processors, to increase performance of the chips. Intel would like to loosen up the traditionally rigid compiler-design process by creating a new, freely available compiler development framework that would allow easy experimentation. The best of the new ideas, in theory, would go to market with future processors. "We're at a point, particularly with IA-64, where we're looking at testing out a number of novel optimizations," said Wilf Pinfold, MRL's business director. "We're looking for a way to test novel ideas and add new techniques in a modular way." Intel's first IA-64 chip, Itanium, is considered a crucial step in Intel's efforts to challenge Sun Microsystems in the lucrative server market, but the chip has been a long time coming. Originally due at the end of 1999, the chip has been delayed several times since, while Intel worked to complete its design. The company later grappled with clock-speed problems but now plans to release 733MHz and 800MHz versions of the chip. While production-level chips are set to ship this quarter, big-name servers using the chips won't arrive until fall. Adding to the drama, most server makers have greater interest in McKinley, the follow-up to the first Itanium chip. But Intel soldiers on with Itanium and its associated technologies, such as compilers. The compiler's work is long completed by the time computer users boot-up their PCs, but it affects people directly in terms of the performance it lends to or takes away from a processor, either in a desktop PC or in a distant network server. A poorly written compiler can sap performance from a chip, while a well-devised one can help squeeze out extra power. "The continued ability to make processors run more quickly is related to a few things, and one of them is the compiler," Pinfold said. One method for increasing processor performance, known as parallelism, tackles many jobs at the same time, instead of waiting for one to finish before moving on to the next. IA-64 chips already use another performance bump, processing data in 64-bit chunks instead of in the 32-bit chunks used by Pentium chips. Just as a person might speed things along at work by making a phone call while waiting for a PC to boot, a processor would tackle several jobs at once. It could also break a large job into many smaller jobs, which could be processed at the same time. Here, the compiler helps to direct data as these jobs are split between parts of a processor. Intel intends to explore these and other means of boosting processor performance by making the compiler more efficient at handling data. "There are some very interesting and innovative ways to split up tasks" between parts of a processor, Pinfold said. The MRL, which maintains an office in Beijing, will tap the academy's Institute of Computing Technology, where engineers are particularly talented in writing system software such as compilers, Pinfold said. There, a dozen or so engineers will work on the new framework in combination with Intel's MRL compiler-research team of 10 to 15 people. The MRL expects to complete the compiler-framework project in about two years. However, it plans to regularly post developments, such as compiler-code modules, for the researchers to review. Analysts said improving compiler performance could boost the performance of IA-64 chips over time. "Certainly, Intel has enough support for IA-64, but the more ideas you can get behind it the better," said Linley Gwennap, principal researcher at The Linley Group. "In theory, if this compiler technology could give better performance, it would be a rising tide for all boats." But until Intel can prove performance improvements, analysts will remain skeptical that the project is aimed at anything more than drumming up more support for IA-64 chips. "Without knowing exactly what these guys are doing, it's tough to see the value," Gwennap said. By making the compiler framework freely available, Intel believes it can benefit from thousands of extra sets of hands. Researchers would download the framework and its associated software tools and test new twists on compilers designed for Intel chips. "At this stage, you learn a lot from breadth of research. You want to test out a lot of ideas, even if some of them are a bit wacky," Pinfold said. Ultimately, however, Intel expects to directly benefit when new ideas for compilers are tested, proven and then written into production-level compiler software, helping to increase performance of future 64-bit chips. Typically, it takes time to perfect the compiler for a new chip, Pinfold said. Now, "we're trying to do some of that work earlier in the game."
2005-03-01 - Intel leads 3264-bit chip sales CEO says   SAN FRANCISCO--Advanced Micro Devices may have come to market with the first x86 chips that can run both 32-bit and 64-bit software, but Intel's chief said his company has surpassed AMD in shipments in that sector. "We are outshipping the competition in that space," Intel CEO Craig Barrett said in an interview with reporters following his keynote speech here at the company's developer forum. Although AMD has been shipping those kinds of chips for about a year longer than rival Intel, the law of large numbers favors Intel. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company controls more than 90 percent of the market for so-called x86 server chips, which are special derivatives of regular desktop processors. Intel began shipping chips with the dual capability last April. (64-bit chips can handle more memory, a huge performance advantage when running databases.) Overall, Intel accounts for about 82 percent of all of the x86 chips shipped. Also, x86 chips account for more than 90 percent of the server chips shipped today. Barrett was also quick to defend Intel's Itanium chip, a 64-bit chip that runs different software. The development began on Itanium in the late 1980s. "We said we'd need a new architecture for high-end computing, that a new architecture was needed, and a simple extension wouldn't do it," he said. On a separate note, Barrett discussed the pending changing of the guard at Intel. In May, he will give up the CEO title to Paul Otellini and become chairman, replacing Andy Grove. As chairman, Barrett will participate in formulating strategies for Intel and will be the public face for the company when meeting with government officials, international dignitaries and educational leaders. Among the issues facing Intel and other technology companies are the declining standards of education in the United States and the lack of support for basic research by many governments, he said. Like other high-tech giants, Intel will continue to garner more revenue and conduct more development overseas. "Seventy-five percent or so of our revenue comes from outside the U.S.," he said. A substantial part of the responsibility for overseas sales will fall to the company's channel products group. Formed in January and run by longtime Intel executive Bill Siu, the group will try to encourage small dealers worldwide to adopt Intel silicon. In contrast to the other Intel groups, which are based in Santa Clara and Oregon, the channel group will be based in Shanghai, Barrett said.
2006-07-18 - Intel launches long-awaited Montecito Itanium  SAN FRANCISCO--Intel launched its "Montecito" Itanium on Tuesday, doubling performance compared with its predecessor and upgrading ambitions for a high-end chip family that got off to a rocky start. Each Montecito chip has two processor cores, which is a first for the Itanium line. Of the six Montecito models introduced, the top-end 9050 has 1.7 billion transistors and 24MB of high-speed cache memory. The models range in clock speed from 1.4GHz to 1.6GHz and in price from $696 to $3,692 (in quantities of 1,000). Initial Itanium models were late, slow and burdened by software incompatibility with widely used x86 chips such as Intel's Pentium. Intel retrenched, gearing Itanium to compete with Sun Microsystems' Sparc and IBM's Power in "big iron" high-end servers. With Montecito, Intel says its troubles are a thing of the past. "We've gone through that hard, painful maturation process of a new architecture," said Pat Gelsinger, general manger of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group. "This thing is gaining momentum." Momentum wasn't helped last year when Intel delayed Montecito from a planned 2005 launch, slowed its top speed by 200MHz, and disabled a feature, code-named Foxton, that would have let the chip run another 200MHz faster when it was cool enough. The delay left a nearly two-year gap from the arrival of Montecito's "Madison 9M" predecessor. Intel ships fewer than 100,000 Itanium processors a quarter, but the volume is growing, said Mercury Research analyst Dean McCarron. "It seems to have its niche in the really big-iron enterprise space among a select few customers," he said. Montecito-based servers generally will start appearing in September. Gelsinger was backed onstage at a press conference here by seven such refrigerator-size Montecito machines that he said weighed eight tons collectively. The systems were from Itanium leader and chip co-developer Hewlett-Packard--the only member of the top-four server companies offering Itanium models--as well as Hitachi, Silicon Graphics Inc., NEC, Bull, Fujitsu and Unisys. The range of systems shows Intel's progress in making Itanium a standard for high-end computers, one that is as widely used as its Xeon is in low-end machines, the company argues. "It creates for the first time an efficiency in mainframe, mission-critical computing," Gelsinger said. HP dominates the Itanium server market, but Gelsinger predicted other Itanium companies will gain share. Of the other members of the top-four server makers, IBM and Dell canceled Itanium servers, and Sun never planned to use the chip. Intel has frequently observed that Itanium is geared for high-end servers, which account for roughly $25 billion of the $50 billion total server market. But that niche is more alluring for server makers, which reap most of that revenue, rather than chipmakers like Intel. For them, shipment volume rather than high prices is the way to recoup research and development and marketing expenses. In an interview Tuesday, Gelsinger acknowledged that Itanium is "not yet to the level of profitability that we hope to see in it," though the chip has surpassed 2006 goals. Technology Business Research analyst Martin Kariithi estimates that Intel's Itanium revenue is currently about $1.5 billion a year. That's a small part of the $38.8 billion in revenue the chipmaker garnered in 2005. Montecito features Montecito is unquestionably a more competitive product, however. On the widely scrutinized TPC-C test of server database abilities, HP's existing four-Itanium rx4640 server with 128GB of memory can perform 161,217 transactions per minute. Its cousin with four dual-core Montecito chips, though, scored 2.1 times better with 344,928 transactions per minute. Dual processing cores represent one advantage over the chip's predecessor. So does the increase in what was an already large 9MB of cache memory. Montecito's 24MB is split into two 12MB sections, one for each core. To make caches more reliable, Montecito introduces a technology called "Pellston" that can automatically detect faulty areas of the cache and shut them off. Video: Intel launches Montecito Itanium CNET News.com's Stephen Shankland talks with Pat Gelsinger about Intel's hopes for the dual core chip. Among other features arriving in Montecito is hyperthreading, the ability for a single processing core to run two separate threads of instructions at once. The core switches to a second thread when the first stalls because it has to wait for data from slow main memory. Although Intel debuted hyperthreading in its Xeon line in 2002, it has been removed for the time being from the current "Woodcrest" Xeons. However, when Intel delayed Montecito in 2005, the company was forced to remove one new feature called Foxton that would have let the chip run 200MHz faster when cool enough. Intel is "still evaluating" Foxton, said Kirk Skaugen, general manager of Intel's server platforms group. He declined to comment on whether it would be used in future Montecito chips or its 2007 successor, code-named Montvale.
2003-12-08 - Intel launches Itanium 2 trial Intel is challenging businesses to a server race. The chipmaker on Monday said it would supply large corporations with servers based on its Itanium 2 free of charge for up to 90 days under a new campaign designed to win customers for the processor. Intel, which calls the trial the Intel Itanium 2 Solution Challenge, wants companies to compare Itanium 2 servers against their current hardware. Intel hopes that this will convince large companies that use servers from Intel rivals to switch to Itanium 2-based servers. The trial is scheduled to run through the summer of 2004, Intel said.
2001-08-28 - Intel innovation could double chip power   SAN JOSE, Calif.--Intel showed off a new chip technology Tuesday that, if successful, will allow one chip to act like two. Called "hyperthreading," the new technology essentially takes advantage of formerly unused circuitry on the Pentium 4 that lets the chip operate far more efficiently--and almost as well as a dual-processor computer. With it, a desktop can run two different applications simultaneously or run a single application much faster than it would on a standard one-processor box. "It makes a single processor look like two processors to the operating system," said Shannon Poulin, enterprise launch and disclosure manager at Intel. "It effectively looks like two processors on a chip." Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel Architecture Group, demonstrated the hyperthreading technology at the Intel Developer's Forum here Tuesday. In the same speech, he showed off a 3.5GHz Pentium 4 running the computer game "Quake 3" and managing four different video streams simultaneously. The Pentium 4 demonstration didn't depend on Hyper-Threading; instead, it came out as part of Intel's effort to show how consumers and software developers will continue to need faster PCs. "There are a lot of tremendous applications on the horizon that will consume the MIPS (millions of instructions per second)," Otellini said. "Gigahertz are necessary for the evolution and improvement of computing." Technically, hyperthreading takes advantage of additional registers--circuits that help manage data inside a chip--that come on existing Pentium 4's but aren't used. Through these registers, the processor can handle more tasks at once by taking better advantage of its own resources. The chip can direct instructions from one application on its floating-point unit, which is where the heavy math is done, and run parts of another application through its integer unit. A chip with hyperthreading won't equal the computing power of two Pentium 4's, but the performance boost is substantial, Poulin said. A workstation with hyperthreaded Xeon chips running Alias-Wavefront, a graphics application, has achieved a 30 percent improvement in tests, he said. Servers with hyperthreaded chips can manage 30 percent more users. Will developers climb aboard? The open question is whether software developers will latch onto the idea. Software applications will need to be rewritten to take advantage of hyperthreading, and getting developers to tweak their products can take an enormous amount of time. Intel, for instance, has been working for well over a year to get developers to rewrite their programs to take full advantage of the features of the Pentium 4, which has been out for approximately nine months. The company even changed the migration program to speed the process of optimizing Pentium III applications for the Pentium 4. Still, to date, only 30 applications have been enhanced to take full advantage of the Pentium 4, according to Louis Burns, vice president and general manager of the Desktop Platforms Group at Intel. But more are on the way, he said. Otellini acknowledged that recruiting developers will take time. "The real key is going to be to get the applications threaded, and that takes a lot of work," he said. Nonetheless, adopting the technology to server and workstations applications should be fairly easy if the application already runs on dual-processor systems, other Intel officials said. "Thread your applications and drivers and OSes to take advantage of this relatively free performance," Otellini asked developers during his speech. Hyperthreading, which will appear in servers and workstations in 2002 and desktops in 2003, is part of an overall Intel strategy to find new ways to squeeze more performance out of silicon. For years, the company has largely relied on boosting the clock speed and tweaking parts of the chip's architecture to eke out gains. The performance gains to be achieved from boosting the clock speed, however, are limited. In all practicality, most users won't experience that much realistic difference between a 1GHz computer and one that contains a 2GHz chip, according to, among others, Dean McCarron, an analyst at Mercury Research. Ideally, hyperthreading, which has been under development for four and a half years, will show meatier benefits. An individual could play games while simultaneously downloading multimedia files from the Internet with a computer containing the technology, Poulin predicted. Hyperthreaded chips would also be cheaper than dual-processor computers. "You only need one heat sink, one fan, one cooling solution," he said, along with, of course, one chip. Chips running hyperthreading have been produced, and both Microsoft's Windows XP and Linux can take advantage of the technology, according to Poulin. Computers containing a single hyperthreaded chip differ from dual-processor computers in that two applications can't take advantage of the same processor substructure at the same time. "Only one gets to use the floating point at a single time," Poulin said. On other fronts, Intel on Tuesday also unveiled Machine Check Architecture, which allows servers to catch data errors more efficiently. The company will also demonstrate McKinley for the first time. McKinley is the code name for the next version of Itanium, Intel's 64-bit chip that competes against Sun's UltraSparc. McKinley is due in demonstration systems by the end of this year.
2008-02-11 - Intel increasingly letting customers lead the way  When you're the world's largest chipmaker, it's hard to turn on a dime. It can be even harder to admit when you've overreached. A shift has taken place at Intel over the last year or so. Once known for dictating the direction of the PC market, Intel is increasingly letting its customers carve their own path. With that subtle yet important change, the PC industry is moving past its Model T era and entering a new world of style and design, where a simple black or gray box won't do. The most recent and telling example of this shift is the special version of the Core 2 Duo that Intel built at the request of Apple, one of its smallest yet most influential customers. Intel accelerated the development of a much smaller chip packaging technology and lowered the chip's power consumption, just so Apple could build the MacBook Air. Intel has done exclusive chips for special customers in the past, but since Sean Maloney took the helm of Intel's sales and marketing in 2006, the chipmaker is much more willing to find a way to meet the needs and ideas of its PC customers--and to recognize that father doesn't always know best. These days, Intel is cleverly taking a page from Advanced Micro Devices, the smaller chipmaker that has managed to work the phrase "customer-centric" into just about every press release and public appearance since 2003. Intel salespeople are now encouraged to spend more time out of the office, talking to PC customers and designers and taking their ideas and concerns back to the mothership. Those customers have rapidly matured; instead of one basic desktop and laptop design for all, they are starting to realize that different people want different things. They are customizing products for various segments and even different geographies, and introducing new designs like Gateway's all-in-one or Apple's MacBook Air. That reality makes it harder to dictate a top-down vision for the PC market, since there are now so many different types of customer needs to try to satisfy. Intel's product-planning priorities have changed as a result. The Nehalem generation of processors, due in the second half of this year, will be one of Intel's most complicated launches ever because of the huge variety among different chips. Some will have integrated memory controllers. Some will have point-to-point interconnects. You'll see dual-core, quad-core, and perhaps more in the server market. Some will be hot-and-heavy powerhouses, while others will be cool and nimble notebook chips. In short, Intel is going to have perhaps its widest variety ever of so-called SKUs (stock-keeping units) to offer its customers, allowing them to choose among several chip versions to find the one that best fits their goals. Just five years ago, the industry worked in a different way. There was little differentiation among PC companies like Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and Gateway; everybody was cranking out bulky black desktops that sounded like jetliners or bulky notebooks with desktop processors that got two hours of battery life playing Minesweeper. The market became all about price competition, and Dell rose to the top on the strength of its world-class manufacturing and assembly operation in central Texas. In their haste to keep up with Dell, everyone in the PC industry hustled to become lean and mean, and basic research and development into design techniques became a near afterthought. That is, until 2005, when Apple announced its decision to switch to Intel's processors. Suddenly, the rest of the PC industry was on notice: they could no longer dismiss Apple as a sideshow act. Now their products were going to be held up against Apple's to an even greater degree, and that scared the hell out of several PC companies that had little to no experience in cutting-edge design. Perhaps in return for enjoying a profit margin four times greater than that of its customers, Intel had been the one pushing the leading edge of PC design prior to 2005. It called for standards that would help reduce the costs of building PCs. It cajoled PC makers into adopting more interesting designs with its own set of concept products. And it recognized the growing importance of mobile computing with Centrino, a one-stop shopping experience for PC companies looking to build smaller, thinner notebooks. That success emboldened Intel. PC companies, trying to recover from the collapse in business spending following the dot-com crash, were eager to cut costs and let Intel and Microsoft spend the money researching new ways to use PCs to grow the size of the market. Intel felt that with its reach, it had a better understanding of the PC market than any one vendor, and the smarts needed to take the industry where it needed to go. Even if they don't want something like the MacBook Air, people now want stylish PCs, not cookie-cutter boxes. Corrine Schulze/CNET Networks Unfortunately, that only went so far. The platform strategy introduced by Intel CEO Paul Otellini, where Intel provides a pre-ordained set of components to PC makers, eventually showed its limits when it comes to predicting consumer tastes and styles in a changing market. It wasn't that the strategy itself was flawed: PC makers definitely wanted the combo meal deal, where they could get the processor, chipset, and networking components fully assembled and tested. Even AMD, which for years criticized the idea of restricting "choice," jumped on board with the platform strategy after acquiring ATI Technologies. It's just that at some point, Intel's ideas stopped resonating with its PC customers, as well as their customers. The Viiv digital home strategy has been a notable failure, as the general public has shown little interest thus far in putting a Windows PC at the center of their entertainment lives. At one point, Dell even forgot that it was supposed to be promoting the brand concept. Earlier on, AMD became a serious player in this business because it listened to server customers who wanted no part of Intel's Itanium route to 64-bit processing. It came out with Opteron, a much cheaper yet still-powerful chip that preserved backward compatibility with software written for the x86 instruction set, and the rest is history. Intel has changed a lot in the past decade. The company was left shaken and humbled by its clear misread of the market in the middle of the decade, and has vowed not to let it happen again. The trick now will be avoiding the same trap AMD fell into in 2006 and 2007. Barcelona, AMD's first quad-core server processor, was the product of repeated customer requests for an integrated quad-core design, according to AMD executives. Faithful to its customers, AMD set off on building that chip, only to run into problems of nightmare proportions as it realized how "complicated" (in the words of CEO Hector Ruiz) that design would be to complete. Barcelona will ship at least a year later than expected as a result, and Intel cornered the quad-core server market by taking a less elegant but easier and quicker route to market. Companies have to make leaps of faith from time to time. Just look at Apple; despite all the risk involved in switching to Intel's chips, it needed a lower-power chip if it wanted to stay relevant in a computer market where people were demanding laptops. Two years later, that has worked out pretty well. But sometimes father does know best. Every now and then, you have to tell a customer who comes to you with a request that "no, it can't be done. And here's why." The bet-the-farm strategy can wind up leaving both you and the customer in the lurch if something goes awry. Can Intel walk the fine line between management consultant and flexible supplier? It will be quite the balancing act for one of the world's largest tech companies, and one that historically at least, is used to pushing rather than pulling.
2000-08-24 - Intel in fast lane with new chips growth strategy  latest developments The chip giant unveils details of several new initiatives at its developers conference this week, including faster server chips, a new architecture for its Pentium 4 processor, and slower-than-expected Itanium chips.

2002-09-09 - Intel Hyperthreading to speed desktops SAN JOSE, Calif.--Intel will bring the performance-enhancing server technology known as hyperthreading to the desktop later this year, and plans to introduce technology in 2003 for securing data on hard drives. The two announcements were the highlights of the opening keynote speech by company president Paul Otellini at the Intel Developer Forum in San Jose, Calif. Complete coverage Intel Developer Forum news Read what visionaries at the confab expect for wireless, security Despite the downturn in the PC market, the company will continue to boost chip performance and add features with the double goal of enhancing the PC experience and gaining an edge over rival Advanced Micro Devices. "There's no doubt it gives us a competitive advantage, but it also gives us a market advantage" by expanding the capabilities of PCs, Otellini said in a briefing held before the speech. Hyperthreading will appear in the 3GHz Pentium 4 for desktops, due later in the quarter. The technology allows different elements of the chip, such as the integer unit for graphics processing and the floating-point unit for complex calculations, to be active at the same time. By multitasking in this manner, chip performance can be boosted by 25 percent to 30 percent, Otellini said. It's a free performance boost, he added, because the circuitry to enable hyperthreading is already inside the Pentium 4. Software applications must be tuned to take full advantage of hyperthreading, and some such programs--Adobe Photoshop and Windows Media Encoder 9, for example--are available or coming to market now. But even applications that aren't tuned, such as Microsoft Outlook, will see a partial boost because the technology will let the chip run two functions from Outlook at the same time, Otellini said. Windows XP and 2000 are already hyperthreaded, he added. For speed freaks, Otellini also demonstrated a 4.5GHz Pentium 4 processor onstage. He was able to rev the chip to 4.7GHz before the machine konked out and offered up a blue screen. Keeping data safe In the second half of 2003, Intel will introduce LaGrande, a security technology that prevents hackers or viruses from obtaining or corrupting data in a PC. "This will minimize the ability of people to steal your credit card number or break into your hard drive to snoop," Otellini said. "Protecting users' data, protecting users' identity, protecting transactions are all on the list of things we want to do." LaGrande places a secure wrapper around selected hard-drive data, as well as around the keyboard, the display and the interconnects inside the computer, said an Intel representative. Currently, data that gets sent to commerce sites is encrypted while traveling between a PC and a server. But once it's back on a hard drive, it reverts to its original form, making it valuable if it can be stolen. Conceptually, LaGrande is similar to IBM's RapidRestore, a feature on IBM notebooks that lets users store applications and data behind a secure partition on the hard drive. The technology, though, will have other functions. It is possible to use it in conjunction with digital rights management programs, such as Microsoft's Palladium, to prevent piracy, which in turn could help promote legal entertainment downloads. Otellini said users will be able to turn LaGrande off. "It will be opt in," he said. LaGrande will make its initial appearance in Prescott, Intel's next generation of desktop chips, coming in the second half of this year. Although LaGrande sounds useful, Intel could have a difficult time getting support for it, especially from Microsoft. "Just like Microsoft eventually integrated signal processing into Windows, they will eventually integrate security processing, and they will do it on their own time," said Peter Glaskowsky, editor in chief of the Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. "Intel needs to work with these things with Microsoft from the beginning." Glaskowsky compared the effort to Native Signal Processing, a chip technology that Intel tried to popularize in the early '90s. Microsoft was strongly opposed to the effort and cajoled other developers not to support it. Eventually, Intel dropped it. "I call this native security processing," said Glaskowsky. Market woes continue Otellini reiterated that the PC market remains slow. The U.S. market is showing few signs of optimism, with consumers more worried about their jobs and the future than getting a new PC, he said. Corporate purchases currently revolve around replacing dead machines. Still, those replacement numbers can add up. There are currently around 500 million PCs in active use today, he said. Despite the recent slowdown in the Asia-Pacific region, the area will still likely drive Intel's sales. "Until this quarter, we've had seven consecutive record quarters in Asia-Pacific," Otellini said. As expected, Otellini also showed off computers from NEC running Madison, the codename of the next version of its Itanium processor, which is scheduled for release next year. Madison will outperform the current Itanium II by 30 percent at launch, he promised. "This chip is about a half a billion transistors," Otellini said. Itanium II contains around 220 million transistors, according to Intel. Hewlett-Packard, which codeveloped the Itanium architecture, is also heavily involved in creating Madison, he added. Sales of Madison, while slightly lagging, should occur in greater volumes than Itanium II "by definition," Otellini said. So far, few Itanium II servers have shipped to the marketplace. Otellini also demonstrated Banias, a new notebook chip coming in the first quarter of next year. Banias notebooks will provide longer battery life than standard Pentium notebooks and come with integrated 802.11a and b wireless technology, he said. Sources say Banias will run at 1.4GHz, 1.5GHz and 1.6GHz, and possibly also at 1.3GHz, at launch. Upon the release of Banias, Intel will introduce a module containing both 802.11a and b wireless chips designed for use in notebooks and desktops. Pre-packaging the chips in a module will help ease adoption, say sources, because motherboard makers will only have to make one, rather than a variety, of boards to accommodate the module. Notebook users also won't have to worry as much about wireless standards.
2002-10-10 - Intel hyperthreading shows Digital roots   Next month, Intel will bring its hyperthreading technology to desktops, another advance in the chip world that can be traced to Digital Equipment Corp. Although Digital often floundered when trying to sell its own chips, the defunct computing giant left behind technologies and engineers that are at the core of many recent and coming advances. "There is all this cool technology coming out on PCs that came from Digital," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. Nonetheless, McCarron, among others, noted that these breakthroughs rarely helped Digital's bottom line. Digital was acquired by Compaq Computer in 1998, and its remnants became part of Hewlett-Packard earlier this year when HP completed its acquisition of Compaq. Nonetheless, technologies with Digital genes march on, including HyperTransport, a high-speed method of chip interconnection championed by Advanced Micro Devices; a future version of Intel's Itanium family of processors; and low-power chips for cell phones and handhelds from both those companies. Intel's hyperthreading, which involves breaking up an application for easier digestion by a computer's processors, derives in part from work on simultaneous multithreading performed by a team of researchers at the University of Washington and Digital, an Intel representative confirmed. In 1997, Intel licensed the patents and hired many of the employees who worked on the project as part of a massive legal settlement between the companies. The threading work will likely leave a lasting impact, as it remains one of the areas of chip architecture where substantial performance gains can likely be achieved without major penalties. With hyperthreading, a chip can run two parts of an application at once, boosting performance by up to 30 percent. The gains come because the application can take advantage of different parts of the chip at the same time. "We're at the place where we have lots of idle resources we can use," said Dean Tullsen, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, and one of the Washington researchers who published the papers on multithreading in 1995, attracting Digital's attention. In the future, "helper threads" that run ahead of the main application to clear the computing path will likely appear, Tullsen added. The Digital divide The transformation of Digital into a posthumous chip powerhouse lies in the circumstances of history. Founded in 1957 by Ken Olsen, the company gained prominence in the minicomputer era and emerged as a chief rival to IBM. The PDP-11, a minicomputer released in the '70s, still garners fans to this day. In the '80s though, the company missed both PCs and Unix because of its obsessive focus on minicomputers. Olsen didn't believe a big market existed for these lower-end products. "He was famous for saying, 'Unix was about as interesting as a Russian truck,'" recalled Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64 and a former Digital employee. In the '90s, the company played catch-up in both markets, but was often saddled by delays and faced the problem of trying to dislodge established leaders. The company developed the Alpha chip in 1992. While touted for its performance, the chip and servers containing it never achieved the same sort of widespread acceptance in the marketplace as competing products from Sun Microsystems, HP or IBM. "A lot of the research stuff--the sales guys couldn't sell (it) because it was ahead of its time," said Richard Belgard, a patent consultant and former engineer at competitor Data General. "Alpha was great technology, but who the hell needs another microprocessor?" Digital also built a state-of-the-art chip fabrication facility in Hudson, Mass., that manufactured Alpha chips and StrongArms, an energy efficient chip for cell phones. That plant rarely, if ever, ran at full capacity. Toward the end of the decade, the intellectual exodus began. In May 1997, the company filed a lawsuit alleging that Intel's then-future Itanium chip violated 10 Alpha patents. Despite the public rancor, the two companies settled the suit by October. Intel obtained the Hudson fab and the rights to make StrongArm, while Digital got $700 million. The two also entered into a 10-year cross-licensing arrangement. Simultaneously, Intel hired a number of the Digital engineers and gradually began to incorporate the company's technology into its own product lines. The StrongArm became the foundation of Intel's IXA network processor line for telecommunications equipment. The XScale chip, used in the latest Power PC handhelds and Sony's Clie, derived from StrongArm as well. A deal between Compaq and Intel in June 2001 led to a further brain transfer. Engineers acquired from Compaq in that deal are now working on compilers for Itanium and future versions of the chip, including "Chivano." HP still sells Alpha servers but plans to phase them out by 2004. Some, though, ended up somewhere other than Intel. Dirk Meyer, one of the chief Alpha engineers, went to AMD in 1996 and co-managed the development of the Athlon, the successful desktop chip released in 1999. Among other Alpha bits, the Athlon uses a bus originally developed for Alpha. Hammer, the next big chip from AMD, also derives design principles from Alpha, said Brookwood, and many Alpha alumni work on the chip. One of the performance enhancements is an integrated memory controller, an idea touted years earlier on Alpha. In true Digital style, the Alpha chips that were to feature multithreading and integrated controllers have been delayed several times. HyperTransport, which will connect Hammer chips, came from work between AMD and Alpha Processor, a defunct joint venture between Compaq and Samsung. Thirty-five engineers from API form the bulk of AMD's Boston Design Center Similarly, Rich Witek and Greg Hoeppner, two former Digital engineers who left the company after the Intel settlement, subsequently formed Alchemy Semiconductor. In February 2002, AMD acquired Alchemy and made it the center of its handheld strategy. While many of these underlying ideas came from Digital, the work to embody them in actual products has been performed by the companies touting them. Inserting hyperthreading into the Pentium 4, for instance, was an in-house job for Intel. "Some of the actual concepts were developed there, but the implementation was done by Intel," the Intel representative said.
2000-06-06 - Intel hosts Itanium PlugFest   About 100 hardware and software developers will be running around an Oregon hotel this week checking to make sure that all the products they are developing for Intel's Itanium chip work together. The Itanium PlugFest, which kicks off tomorrow, is aimed at making sure that when Intel debuts its 64-bit processor later this year all the components can work together. Representatives from computer makers such as Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer and Dell Computer along with market leaders from Microsoft to EMC will be literally taking their products door-to-door through the Embassy Suites Hotel in Tigard, Ore. The companies will make sure all the disk drives can work with the different servers and workstations that in turn can run a variety of operating systems from Windows to Linux. The PlugFest is the latest in Intel's long marketing and developing push for the new chip, which the Santa Clara, Calif.-based giant hopes will allow it to rival Sun Microsystems and others in the market for the high-end servers that power the Internet. Intel plans a second, similar event in September for smaller firms and those in other areas such as communications and networking. The Itanium chip is scheduled to be released in the third quarter of 2000, with server and workstations being released in the months following the chip's release. Intel said it has already shipped 4,000 prototype Itanium servers and workstations to developers. Last month, Intel detailed the chip's microarchitecture on its Web site.
2004-05-07 - Intel hastily redraws road maps    Intel has redrawn its product plans for 2005, shelving two chips and announcing vague plans about the processors that will come out next year. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker confirmed that it will shelve Tejas, a version of the Pentium 4 due out later this year, and Jayhawk, a similar Xeon chip for servers that had been slated for 2005. In their place, Intel will come out with dual-core chips for desktops in 2005 and for notebooks in 2005 or 2006, an Intel representative said. Earlier, Intel had indicated that dual-core chips for these markets might not appear until 2006 or later. Dual-core chips can provide far better performance than traditional single-core chips. Intel's plans, however, appear to be quite vague at the moment. The representative could not identify code names for the new products. It is also unclear whether the chips will be made using the 90-nanometer manufacturing process or the newer 65-nanometer process. "Dual-core is a more sane way for getting more performance without breaking other things." --Dean McCarron, analyst,Mercury Research Typically, when announcing new chips, Intel provides the new code names and sometimes describes the manufacturing process. The chips also have not "taped out," the representative said, which means that the design is not yet finalized. Tape-out usually occurs a year before shipment. The shift in the company's product plans likely comes as a way to get around the problem of excess power consumption, said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64. The circuits on chips have become so small, and the chips are consuming so much power, that it is becoming extremely difficult and expensive to keep the temperature inside PCs down. Excess internal heat can cause signaling problems and melt parts. The current line of top-end Pentium 4s each consume 100 watts, or more than most household lightbulbs. Much of that energy is lost in leakage. By making a dual-core chip with each chip running at a moderate speed, Intel can increase peformance and reduce power consumption. "The benefits of increasing clock frequency are beginning to be offset by the liabilities of heat dissipation," Brookwood said. "They won't be pushing as hard on clock frequency as they did in the past." The change was also likely prompted by opportunism, said Dean McCarron, an analyst at Mercury Research. Right now, about three-fourths of the real estate on Intel's desktop chips consists of cache, or high-speed memory built into the processor. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. Intel engineers probably determined that they could get more benefits, both in terms of performance and power consumption, by using a smaller cache and two cores. The company also likely has already figured out many of the problems that come with moving to dual-core chips, anyway, as they plan to bring out a dual-core Itanium in 2005. "Dual-core is a more sane way for getting more performance without breaking other things," he said. "You get more performance out of the transistors." McCarron added that Intel is a planning-centric company, so shifts like this are out of character. Gordon Haff, an analyst at Illuminata, added that the success of Pentium M has made Intel comfortable with lower chip speeds. Chip analyst Peter Glaskowsky, however, said that the move underscores major problems at Intel. When it introduced the Pentium 4 in 2000, the company said the underlying architecture would last a decade. Now, it appears the architecture will start to get phased out in the next few years. Additionally, Intel may start to lose some credibility with hardware makers, Glaskowsky said. A few months ago, the company reversed itself and followed AMD into 32/64-bit chips. Additionally, the dual-core chips may not score well on benchmarks. "The Pentium 4 has just not delivered what it should have. It was a billion-dollar effort," he said, adding "AMD will totally kill them on benchmarks" in 2005. Engineers and designers first began to discuss the looming crisis in 2000, and power consumption has already been taking its toll on Intel. Despite three years of fairly flawless execution, Intel had to slightly delay the release of Prescott, the latest Pentium 4, to February in order to solve some power consumption problems. It then announced a 3.4GHz Prescott earlier this year and said it would come out in April. The chip has only just begun to come out in limited volumes, according to sources. Dothan, a notebook chip coming out on Monday, was supposed to come out earlier this year. To get around future power consumption issues, Intel already plans to bring its notebook chip designs to desktops with Jonah in 2007.
2001-07-11 - Intel halts sales of defective server chip Intel has stopped shipping its top-end server chip because of a bug that could cause servers to crash. Intel began shipping the chip, the Pentium III Xeon with 2MB of high-speed "cache" memory, in March. But about a month later, a company that sells computers using the chip notified Intel that it found a problem while testing the chip, Intel spokesman Bill Kircos said Tuesday. Intel was able to reproduce the problem but unable to patch existing systems, Kircos said. Accordingly, the company stopped shipping the chip in mid-April. Intel is changing the chip's manufacturing process, and a new version of the processor is expected to begin shipping in mid-August, Kircos said. Until then, Intel will swap out the defective chip with the slower 700MHz version. The problem is comparatively minor because few customers had the chip at this early stage in its life, Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood said. "It's very contained. I doubt any end-users have experiences or are likely to experience this problem," Brookwood said. In addition, the customers buying the chip are comparatively rare and often are satisfied with a 700MHz chip. Though Intel characterized the problem as minor, the company doubtless would prefer to sell the 900MHz model, which sells for $3,692 in quantities of 1,000, compared with $1,980 for the 700MHz chip. It's not easy designing high-end chips, which typically feature more circuitry and run under higher stress than the CPUs of desktop computers. Sun Microsystems found a problem in its new top-end UltraSparc III chip that forced the company to disable a speed-boosting feature, even though the problem only was found in lab testing. But companies have to be conservative when dealing with demanding server customers, the people in charge of the computers that handle critical business operations such as tracking inventory or booking plane reservations. The Pentium III Xeon is one of a host of high-end server chips Intel is selling as a way to take on Sun and other more established server companies. The 900MHz Pentium III Xeon with 2MB of cache is the current top-end product for multiprocessor servers. Eventually replacing it will be a server version of the Pentium 4 chip, code-named Foster and sold since May under the name Xeon with no "Pentium" prefix. But the 2MB cache feature, which increases the size, speed and price of the chip, isn't yet available on the Xeon. That model is expected in the first quarter of 2002, Kircos said. Also coming in 2002 is a version of the Xeon chip built with smaller, faster 0.13-micron circuitry, Kircos said. This chip is code-named Prestonia, Brookwood said. But for the long term, Intel is banking heavily on a totally different design called Itanium. This chip, which began shipping in servers in June, speaks a totally different language than the Pentium and Xeon lines. Because it's such a dramatic departure and requires big changes to software, it is largely used as a development system at present. Intel had hoped to be able to screen for the problem so it could continue to sell 900MHz chips that didn't show the defect, Kircos said, but that plan didn't work out. "The workaround we hoped would keep them shipping was a screen," he said. "We didn't feel the screen met our quality standards. We decided to go with a manufacturing tweak." Intel's problem occurs in rare circumstances in "extreme" testing and hasn't been reported by any system users, Kircos said. When the problem occurs, the chip fails to write information to a part of the processor that keeps track of what tasks are going on, locking the chip into an endless loop of pointless processing.
2003-07-02 - Intel gets more key Alpha alums    Pete Bannon, one of the key architects behind the touted Alpha processor, and a number of other Alpha engineers are joining Intel to work on future versions of Itanium. Bannon and approximately 50 Alpha engineers will move from Hewlett-Packard to Intel this month, the company announced this week. The transition is the latest stage in a technological wagon train that began in 2001 as the result of a massive development agreement between the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker and Compaq Computer, which at the time controlled Alpha. Around 300 former Alpha engineers already work at Intel. By the time the agreement is concluded, more than 450 are expected to move to Intel, company spokeswoman Barbara Grimes said. Most of the Alpha alumni are working on a version of the Itanium that will follow Montecito, a version of Itanium with two separate processors in a single piece of silicon coming in 2005. Although the Alpha chip has never sold as well as other server chips, such as the UltraSparc family from Sun Microsystems, analysts and engineers have praised its performance. Digital Equipment first released the chip in the early 1990s. Compaq acquired Alpha in 1998 when it bought Digital, and HP became the owner when it bought Compaq. The chip, and the Alpha development team, directly and indirectly influenced other major processors. The original Athlon chip from Advanced Micro Devices used a bus initially created for the Alpha. The new Opteron chip features a high-speed chip-to-chip interconnect called HyperTransport and an integrated memory controller--technologies similar to those touted earlier in Alpha. Dirk Meyer, AMD's top processor executive, worked on the Alpha. Similarly, Hyperthreading, a technology in the Pentium 4 that lets a chip do multiple tasks simultaneously, was inspired in part by research performed at Digital first. Brannon on Tuesday joined Intel as an "Intel fellow," the job title given to the company's deep thinkers. Like their counterparts at IBM, fellows at Intel sketch out strategic technological plans. While an employee at Compaq, Bannon was known for making disparaging comments about Itanium at the Microprocessor Forum, one of the big, annual events for semiconductor makers. Bannon "will be leading a system interface architecture team for a future Itanium product," Grimes said. That processor will be released after Montecito. Kevin Krewell, a senior editor at The Microprocessor Report, said it won't be surprising if Brannon and his team work on technologies similar to Hypertransport or integrating a memory controller. In June, Mike Fister, general manager of the Intel enterprise platform group, said the company is considering integrating a memory controller into its server chips and improving the chip interconnects. The move for the Alpha team likely won't be difficult. Intel owns the building in Hudson, Mass., where they work. "It is a migration from one end of the building to another," Krewell said.
2003-02-25 - Intel gets inside life sciences    Intel says its processors are behind efforts to find new breakthroughs in life sciences research and healthcare in a number of countries. The Santa Clara, Calif., chipmaker, which began an effort to boost its presence in life sciences in November, said on Tuesday that 15 universities and other research institutes in Australia, India, China and Singapore--all focused on areas such as medicine and genetics--are using or will soon put into place new computers based on Intel chips. Some of the research efforts are relying on clusters, which link multiple desktop or server computers to harness their collective computing power, while others are using more traditional multiple-processor supercomputers from companies such as SGI. Researchers see new avenues for discovery using these systems to perform large calculations for tasks such as gene mapping. Intel sees additional revenue from higher sales of its Itanium, Xeon and Pentium 4 chip lines as well as the potential for brand new categories of chips. The chipmaker isn't alone among tech companies angling for a stake in the life sciences. On Tuesday, Intel rival Sun Microsystems headed to North Carolina to launch a research center dealing in bioinformatics and computational biology. The center is designed to foster collaboration among Duke University, North Carolina State University, the University of North Carolina and other schools in areas such as genomics--and to get them to use Sun hardware along the way. IBM--some of whose computers use Intel chips--has also launched a number of programs to deliver computers, software and services to customers in life sciences. Those efforts include providing technology and services to help companies hunt for new drugs and selling grid-computing packages to life sciences companies. Computing grids connect computer networks to share computing power, data storage and other resources. One technology that has caught on recently is the high-performance computing cluster, which provides researchers with an avenue to low-cost computational power. Clusters group large numbers of otherwise standard computers using Linux or other operating systems. They've been giving more traditional supercomputers a run for their money in areas such as genetics, where researchers require computers to tackle a large number of individual tasks. Hong Kong Baptist University, for one, has tapped such an assemblage to explore traditional Chinese medicine. Its project, designed to identify and classify herbs in an effort to understand the ways herbal remedies work, uses a cluster built out of 64 Xeon-based computers, from Dell Computer, running the Linux operating system. "Buying an Intel-based cluster running Linux gives us more bang for the buck, plus we have access to the plethora of open-source software developed for this environment," Fred Hickernell, professor at Hong Kong Baptist University's Department of Mathematics, said in a statement. But research institutions such as Australia's Queensland Parallel Supercomputer Foundation, a consortium of six universities in Queensland, plan to stick to their guns. The foundation will soon install a supercomputer built by SGI and based on Intel Itanium chips to conduct research into bioinformatics, computational physics and chemistry, Intel said. Intel, in partnership with companies including Dell, is enjoying the newfound popularity of computing clusters, which can use very large numbers of its Pentium 4 and Xeon processors. But the chipmaker isn't just working to promote its products for researchers. It is also dreaming up new ways to place current and future chips into medical equipment and even into everyday devices that could eventually offer built-in health-monitoring capabilities. "The building blocks that we can do in silicon can become the new building blocks for other industries," said Pat Gelsinger, Intel's chief technology officer. One spur for Intel into the areas of life sciences and healthcare has been the aging of the of the world's population. Approximately 11 percent of people worldwide are over 60, a figure that will increase to 21 percent by 2050, said Eric Dishman, a health research manager at Intel. As the average age of the population increases, medicine will shift, Dishman predicts. Intel's research is largely focused in two basic areas: chips that can be inserted into medical devices or replace traditional lab equipment, and chips that serve as sensors to aid in preventive medicine. When it comes to medical devices, Intel, like others, is working on microfluidics chips, among other things. These chips can be used to test blood samples for diseases, the company has said. Meanwhile, Intel's research into preventive healthcare has it inventing new sensors that can communicate with computer networks and help detect early warning signs of diseases like Alzheimer's, or even pester patients to take medicines or exercise, Dishman said Many of these systems rely on Bayesian networks, which gather data on a person's daily habits and warn doctors or family members outside the home that a change in the regular pattern has occurred. Intel is working with several health organizations, medical device companies and regulatory bodies on these products, he said. Intel's migration into healthcare is aided by the progression of the chip industry as detailed by Moore's Law, said Andy Berlin, who heads biotechnology research at Intel. That theory accurately predicted that the number of transistors on a chip would double every two years, a development that has led to smaller, cheaper, faster and more sophisticated chips. At some point, cheap microprocessors with integrated networking capabilities could be fit into things like "smart" bandages or mirrors that scan a person's face to detect anomalies such as potentially cancerous lesions. "We would like to turn healthcare...into a chip industry," Berlin said.
2005-09-15 - Intel fortifies Shanghai connections   Chipmaker Intel on Thursday said it has opened a new research and development arm for the Asia-Pacific region in Shanghai, China. Dubbed Asia-Pacific R&D, the new center intends to scout for fresh research and manufacturing talent in China. The chipmaker did not disclose the amount of money it will spend on the new facility, located in Shanghai's Zizhu Science Park. The center is expected to employ 1,000 people by the end of 2006. Intel had earlier made clear its plans to set up new design centers in four major cities in developing parts of the world: Bangalore, India; Cairo, Egypt; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Shanghai. These centers are expected to design PCs, components and software suiting local needs in different parts of the world. Separately Thursday, Intel announced its plans to invest a total of $345 million in its existing manufacturing units in Colorado Springs, Colo., and Hudson, Mass. The funds will be used to augment the capacity of Intel's wafer fabrication facilities there. Fab 17 in Hudson and Fab 23 in Colorado Springs--in which $155 million and $190 million is respectively invested--produce primarily chipsets, communications and flash memory components for diverse Intel platforms. The additional investment in the Colorado facility will go toward a microprocessor-finishing room that may create several hundred new jobs over the next three years, Intel said. Money allocated to the Massachusetts facility will be used to enhance its overall capacity to manufacture chipsets for Intel's initiatives in the mobile, desktop and server markets. The investment is expected to result in 300 additional manufacturing jobs. The chipmaker has also identified a location in Fort Collins, Colo., to accommodate a portion of the company's Itanium design team.
2004-02-18 - Intel fleshes out Itanium plans    SAN FRANCISCO--Intel described two new technologies for its Itanium family and fleshed out its plans for the processor, as the company tries to build momentum for the high-end server chip. Later this year, the company plans to release an enhanced version of the so-called Madison Itanium 2 chip that will run at 1.7GHz and contain 9MB of level-three cache. Although Intel has discussed the supersize cache, the speed has not been disclosed before. Current Madisons have a maximum of 6MB of cache and a top speed of 1.5GHz. Typically, more cache and faster chip speeds lead to greater performance. Additionally, the company plans to come out with Fanwood, a less expensive version of Madison. Fanwood will run at 1.6GHz, slower than the 1.5GHz Madison chips selling today, and contain 3MB of level-three cache. Intel also will release a 1.2GHz version of Fanwood that consumes less power than the 1.6GHz version, Mike Fister, general manager of the Enterprise Platforms Group at Intel, said during a keynote speech Wednesday at the Intel Developer Forum here. In 2005, the company is expected to release a whole new line of Itanium 2 chips. Montecito will contain two processor cores, the brain inside the brain that is the processor, and a 24MB level-three cache. Millington, meanwhile, will be a budget version of Montecito. A low-power version of Millington also will come out. The Montecito and Millington chips will contain two new technologies: Foxton for power management and Pellston for correcting data errors in the cache. There will even be a budget, low-power version of Tukwila, the multicore offspring of Itanium that is expected to be released toward the middle of the decade. It is code-named Dimona, Fister said. The future of Itanium is the central theme at the forum taking place this week. Servers that use the chip, which specializes in running complex 64-bit code, have posted some of the highest benchmarks in the industry, according to organizations that tally those results. Sales of the chip also have picked up. Intel CEO Craig Barrett on Tuesday said that more than 110,000 Itanium chips have shipped since the processor's introduction, and most of those shipped last year. Fister said the price of Itanium is dropping fast. In a few years, servers that use the chip won't cost any more than those running the now less expensive Intel Xeon processor, he said. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a regular Enterprise Hardware column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. "I expect that by middle of the decade we will cost parity with Xeon with about twice the performance," he said. The server market, however, is increasingly dominated by so-called x86 chips that can run standard Windows or Linux code. More than 90 percent of servers shipped in the fourth quarter contained x86 chips such as Xeon or Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron. More than half the server industry's revenue comes from x86 servers. While Itanium can run Windows or Linux code, it runs well only when software has been specifically ported to it. Although Microsoft has released a version of Windows for Itanium and more than 1,000 applications exist, it's a comparatively small universe. This week, Intel also announced that it plans to release a version of Xeon in the second quarter, code-named Nocona, that can run standard 32-bit Windows or Linux code as well as enhanced 64-bit versions of this software. Analysts have predicted that this sort of capability could slow any budding momentum for Itanium. A 64-bit chip can pull data out of a vast amount of memory, while 32-bit chips can only harvest from 4GB, a ceiling many server users have already hit. Fister, though, said that the two lines will coexist and that Intel will dedicate resources to developing both lines. For the most part, Itanium will go into computers with the most complex workloads such as databases. Still, in a few years, the two chips' markets will begin to cross over, probably in the four-processor server market, he said.
2004-07-23 - Intel fills in more details on Itanium family  Intel will add a number of features to two upcoming Itanium family chips, as it looks to cut power consumption, raise performance and, hopefully, stoke greater interest among buyers. Montecito, an Itanium 2 that will arrive next year, will sport SpeedStep, a technology first deployed in notebooks that slows down a chip during lull periods to cut power, said Jason Waxman, a director in Intel's Enterprise Multiprocessor Platforms group. The chip will also contain a complementary technology called Foxton that will speed things up during peak periods. Overall, Montecito will consume about 20 percent less power than current Itanium 2 chips, Waxman said. At the same time, the chip will likely be connected to the rest of the system with a 667MHz bus, faster than the 400MHz bus found on current Itanium 2s, and run at about 2GHz, faster than the 1.5GHz version out now, Waxman hinted. Some large Montecito machines will also contain multiple buses, an approach designed to free up the data traffic jams that can occur in 16- and 32-processor machines. Beefing up Itanium remains one of the primary concerns at Intel. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has spent more than a billion dollars in the past decade on chip development, server designs, venture investments and software to create a full-fledged environment for Itanium. Computers containing the chip rank among the fastest machines in the world, and sales have substantially improved in the past 18 months. Still, Itanium holds only a fraction of the market, and analysts and competitors often assert that it will remain a niche product. An estimated 100,000 chips shipped last year. Some software developers have curtailed Itanium projects. To top it off, the market Itanium was designed to dominate, the RISC server market, is shrinking as a result of the popularity of chips like Intel's own Xeon and the Opteron from Advanced Micro Devices. More, more, more Other enhancements to Montecito include multithreading. The technology from the Xeon chip server line, which allows a chip to run multiple applications, will be integrated into Itanium for the first time. With multithreading, the dual-core Montecito will be able to process four applications simultaneously, compared with only one for current Itaniums. "We have four times the number of threads, but less power (consumption)," Waxman said. The multithreading benefit coming in Montecito will give the chip a performance boost of about 10 percent to 20 percent, he said. In comparison, IBM's simultaneous multithreading in its Power5 processors boosts performance about 30 percent, Big Blue has said. Tukwila, the Montecito successor coming in 2007, will sport these same features but contain more processor cores and probably other enhancements. Montecito will have two cores, while Tukwila will have at least four, with plans for up to 16. Budget versions of Tukwila will be able to fit into cheaper Xeon servers, a crucial part of a plan on Intel's part to reduce customer resistance to Itanium. Even before Tukwila, the prices had been coming down, Waxman noted. In 2002, a two-processor Itanium 2 server could cost $18,000. A similarly configured system today costs about $8,000, and entry-level systems can cost $2,100. "Two years ago, customers got sticker shock," he said. Ease of use A third theme of Itanium's evolution is simplified management. Intel essentially is trying to make it easier to build or own a server with the chip. Pellston technology, which will be inside Montecito, will allow a computer to kill malfunctioning sections of a chip's cache, a pool of memory embedded in the chip, and continue to use the chip. Currently, users have to replace these chips to prevent recurring errors. Silvervale technology, meanwhile, will help boost the performance of existing virtualization software such as EMC's VMware and Microsoft's Virtual Server, which lets a computer run several operating systems in different partitions, Waxman said. A later version arriving with Tukwila will expand to include more sophisticated partitioning technology of its own. On other notes, Waxman reiterated that Intel is coming out soon with a version of the Itanium 2 that will have a 9MB cache and run near 1.7GHz. Current versions run at 1.5GHz and come with up to 6MB of cache. Intel is taking pains to emphasize reliability features of the Itanium family, such as Machine Check Architecture, or MCA, which enhances a server's ability to detect computer-generated errors. Using equipment at a national laboratory, Intel bombarded Montecito servers with gamma rays and alpha particles to verify that MCA really caught errors before they caused crashes or data corruption. The test--essentially accelerated-wear testing--revealed that individual chips had an average time between failures of hundreds of years, Waxman said.

2006-03-10 - Intel feeds virtualization's need for speed    SAN FRANCISCO--With the first generation of Intel Virtualization Technology now being built into most of the chipmaker's products, Intel is turning its attention to improving its performance. Virtualization makes it easier to run several operating systems simultaneously on the same computer, an idea of high interest to those trying to run multiple tasks more efficiently. But the virtualization control software, called a hypervisor or virtual machine manager, imposes a performance penalty as it manages resources such as memory or input-output. It's that performance penalty Intel is trying to fix. "As we build future implementations, we're making things perform better within the constraints of the architectural foundation, but without requiring software changes. Then we're also extending the architecture," Richard Uhlig, senior principal engineer at Intel, said during an interview at the Intel Developer Forum. Intel has begun building its VT abilities into its chips that make virtualization easier, and its top rival, Advanced Micro Devices, will begin selling its AVT equivalent later this year with its Rev F processors. The goal of Intel's first version of VT was to improve features of virtual machine software. For example, the leading virtualization product for x86 computers, EMC's VMware, can run 64-bit operating systems in its virtual machines through use of VT. And an open-source rival, Xen, can run Microsoft Windows on VT-enabled systems. One planned improvement is a feature called extended page tables, an idea similar to an AMD virtualization technology called nested page tables. Both technologies speed up a facet of virtual machines dealing with memory. In a computer without virtual machines, the operating system expects memory addresses to start at zero and work their way upward. But with many virtual machines sharing a computer's memory, zero isn't the starting place, and memory addresses skip from one patch to another, Uhlig said. Consequently, one important job of a hypervisor is "page table shadowing," which translates a virtual machine's memory addresses to the real ones used by the actual computer. The more translation is required, the slower the virtual machine runs, and with programs such as databases that constantly switch among different patches of memory, the performance penalty can be anywhere from 10 percent to 25 percent, Uhlig said. New versions of VT will get a feature called the page table walker, in which the processor rather than the hypervisor keeps track of that memory issue, he said. The overhead imposed "doesn't drop to zero," but will be much faster than the software-based function, Uhlig said. Intel's "Paxville" versions of its Xeon chip brought a VT implementation called VT-x to the server market in 2005, and more widely used "Dempsey" processors are due to arrive in servers in May or June. The VT-i version for Itanium processors is scheduled to arrive in servers starting in the third quarter with systems using Intel's "Montecito" chip. Another improvement coming in hardware support for virtualization is the expansion of the technology into the domain of networking and other input-output tasks. Intel announced its VT-d specification Tuesday for some I/O virtualization, a month after AMD made a similar move. But more sophisticated changes to networking are farther off because they require changes to the PCI standard that network cards and many other add-on devices use. For example, one idea that Intel plans to support is the splitting of a network card's capacity among different virtual machines. Work is under way at the PCI Special Interest Group to add features that will permit such splitting, said Rajesh Sankaran, an Intel senior staff researcher. The new specification is due later this year, and the first products supporting it are expected in 2007, he said.
2007-02-27 - Intel eyes the future of Itanium   In his nearly 30 years with Intel, Pat Gelsinger has led the design team for the 80486 processor, produced the ProShare videoconferencing system, and was chief technical officer during some of the most exciting--and troubled--times for the chipmaker. Now that he's in charge of Intel's biggest and most important division, the Digital Enterprise Group, he's responsible for both the Core and Itanium processor lines. In London for a conference on power management in data centers, Gelsinger sat down with CNET News.com's sister site ZDNet UK to discuss a wide range of issues, in particular how Itanium is converging with the new Core architecture, how quickly the developing world is catching up in supercomputing, and the debate he doesn't expect to see concluded before 2020. Q: How are you getting on with moving developments in the Core architecture onto the Itanium? Gelsinger: Itanium used to be a shared development process between HP and Intel. We've consolidated that with the agreement we announced two years ago, which allowed us to integrate all of the Itanium development activities and get a consistent development methodology. Since that move, we've basically hit all of our timings--the first Montecito slip aside, we're back on track. It's not that far away until you'll see the one-chip blade. Part of that on-trackness means we can leverage the same circuit design libraries, process technologies, all of those other things we were not doing a good job with before. So going forward, the circuit techniques, the power-management technologies, all those sorts of things are much better leveraged. The first realization of that is Tukwila (quad-core Itanium) in late 2008, the next step in the product family, where we move to common system architecture elements, as well as full alignment on design tools and process. It's still a different microarchitecture, a different instruction set, still aiming at a different market segment than the core of our product line. I'm driving for more convergence in Poulson (post-Tukwila Itanium) and beyond. Presumably the cache architectures are converging as you move to a common bus? Gelsinger: Yep. You just get more and more, and some of the differences that we had before weren't for good reasons, and we're bringing those together, so I'm pretty happy that this gives us much better leverage for the R&D investments. As you move to a common systems architecture, it's much better investment for the customers as well. HP can say: "I can do a platform development, so I have a lower-end Xeon platform that can be used to bring Itanium lower in my product line," so you start to get that not just in our developments, but also in the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) developments. Do you see convergence continuing to the point where there's one chip with a mode bit (making it compatible with Core and Itanium)? Gelsinger: I don't see it getting that far, but I am driving these things to be as common as possible. How's the heterogeneous versus homogeneous multicore debate going within Intel? Gelsinger: I expect that debate to be going until 2020, and I expect--in my crystal ball--different market segments coming to different conclusions in that discussion. You can clearly envision--and this is an easier discussion to have after IDF (Intel Developer Forum) than it is today, so we'll have to have the next installment of this discussion after April 17--but you can see the lower end of the product line having homogeneous, little cores. You could imagine the midrange of the product saying: "We need some big cores, for performance, but little cores are more efficient for certain portions of the workload." You can imagine some embedded applications where you have big cores but with some special-purpose cores for other, specific applications, maybe XML acceleration or packet processing or other things like that--a range of building blocks, from little cores to big cores to special purpose cores. You now have a fabric of choices to mix and match for the market segment. Won't you need some complicated design and verification tools to maintain a large library of very complex cores? Is that a limiting factor in the speed at which you can develop them? Gelsinger: Sure. Verification is already a limiting factor. That ends up being the rate-limiting portion of new products coming to market. That continues to be the case looking forward, although I do expect that to be helped by formal verification methods and formalization of on-die interconnect. What happens is that near the CPU is a great sucking sound. Some CPUs suck more than others. Gelsinger: In multiple respects...Anyway, the CPU starts hauling everything in. What you saw as the system architecture yesterday, tomorrow is the on-die architecture. As that starts to come together, some of these formalizations, interfaces, etc. become part of the die. It's not that far away until you'll see the one-chip blade. You've just announced a new transistor design on the 45-nanometer process. How far will it take you before you have to have another look at the transistor architecture? Gelsinger: There's the structure of the transistor and the materials of the transistor. The materials we just announced; the move to hafnium and metal gate is good for quite some time. We don't expect to change the material structure for a while--improve it, tune it, perhaps, but it's going to last us for several generations. In terms of the structure of the transistor, we've already been talking about changing to a tri-gate structure, changing the physical structure to have better control as well as to have a surface area for the leakage. We're looking to make changes. That's one of our key research areas over the next couple of generations. We're good at 45 (nanometers), not likely to change at 32, but beyond that it's pretty likely we'll look at a new structure. You've talked a lot about power and environmental factors in the data center. What's Intel doing? Gelsinger: We've been doing a lot as a company ever since (Intel co-founder) Gordon Moore; he had a penchant in this direction. We plan our own operations in terms of environmental efficiency; we sponsor a lot of initiatives in the industry, and obviously our energy-efficient product line has been a big deal for us. How well is the move to more efficient computing going? Gelsinger: You need metrics to measure it. Like any of these kinds of things there's lie, lies and benchmarks. We've worked on SpecPower, vConsolidate, Ecomark, which have all been important efforts for us in defining how things work. We've had a good success with a number of the big data centers and started on our own operations. What we've seen is this incredible densification of the data center, and it's led to the compute space being compressed by something of the order of 20 times over the past decade. The developing world isn't as far behind as you might think. Generally, the thermal envelopes have gone down by about two (times), but because the computing space is getting denser you're seeing almost 50 times the amount of power density. That's pretty stunning. Data center managers are putting 100 servers where they used to have 10, and the amount of compute you're getting in that space is typically two times what you had before, so with Moore's law and other microarchitectural improvements, the performance you're delivering is pretty stunning. Where are the tools for power management? Gelsinger: Intel wouldn't claim that we've solved all of those problems. But we're also working with the key OEMs, HP, IBM, and so on, as well as working directly with some key users, giving them our BKMs--our best-known methods--and applying them to their environments. You'll see a number of different announcements in the very near future, to put these ideas under a broader umbrella. Are there major differences in data centers around the world? Gelsinger: The developing world isn't as far behind as you might think. Their sophistication in planning and building their data centers is rapidly catching up to the mature markets, but there's still a gap. One unexpected key sign is that every one of the major emerging countries--Russia, India, Brazil and so on--has major high-performance computing projects as well as major megadata center efforts under way. You're seeing Baidu trying to position itself as the Google of China. You're seeing China and India putting petaflop programs in place to be in the front edge. Why can't they leapfrog, as with communications, by taking everyone's best practices without their legacy? Gelsinger: I don't see them leapfrogging at this time, but I see the five-year gap we used to expect become a much shorter gap in these scenarios, maybe a one- or two-year gap at this point. But they're coming on strong. It's amazing. You go and see a Baidu data center, and it's pretty impressive. But you look at India saying, "We're going to have a petaflop machine in 2008." That's pretty impressive for a country that not long ago wasn't even in the high-performance computing race, and they could be literally No. 2 or No. 3 in the world. They see the challenge in racing China as well as looking north, and both of those have brought a lot of impetus in installing IT infrastructures. When do you see power becoming an important issue for smaller data centers, ones with handfuls of servers? Gelsinger: If you're just talking 30 or 40 servers, then power's not that big a deal--only hundreds of dollars' difference per year. But people are environmentally concerned, so they're putting those priorities ahead of just the savings associated with them. If I ran a Google data center I could be talking about millions of dollars of operational costs per year, plus as a company they're trying to position themselves at the front end as eco-friendly and environmentally conscious, as part of their corporate positioning, and I think you're going to see that trend increase. We're seeing the digitization of industries. Amazon is becoming a retailer of mammoth proportions. Google's out to digitize the world. The environmental impacts of these data centers are increasingly concerning governments, as environmental issues become more important in general. Rupert Goodwins of ZDNet UK reported from London.
2004-12-17 - Intel expands core concept for chips   Intel plans to release chips with two processing cores next year, but that's just the start. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip giant intends to exploit the concept of using multiple processor cores--the part of the microprocessor that does the math--as a way to increase performance of its chips during the next few years. Chips with four cores and eight cores will eventually join dual-core chips. The company's research department is also looking at the feasibility of creating chips with hundreds of cores to assist servers and supercomputers with large numbers of relatively repetitive calculations, said Steve Smith, vice president of the desktop platforms group at Intel. News.context What's new: Intel is turning its attention to chips with two processor cores--and more. Bottom line: Multiple cores are a way to get more performance without big boosts in power consumption. But Intel's not alone--AMD and others are heading that way, too. One company even plans a 96-core chip. More stories on chip cores The focus on multiple cores arises from Moore's Law, which dictates that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years. In the past, the extra transistors have been used to increase the size of the cache, an integrated pool of memory for rapid data access, or to boost other performance-enhancing features, such as instruction-level parallelism, which lets a chip do more than one task per clock cycle. However, Intel is now employing the extra transistors to create additional cores to boost performance, a measure it says it can take without drastically increasing chips' power consumption. Power consumption was among the reasons that Intel shifted to the dual-core strategy and canceled Tejas, a high-speed, single-core successor to the Pentium 4. Continuing the trend of quickly upping its processors' clock speeds would have eventually boosted their power consumption above practical levels, Intel has said. "We're doing (dual-core chips) because we believe it's a more efficient way to use our transistor budget," Smith said. One of the key areas where consumers may notice the dual-core difference will likely come when they run two or more applications, Smith said. With two cores, a consumer can edit a movie from a digital video camera in the background or record a television show using a personal video recorder setup--while surfing the Web, sending e-mail and performing other tasks. Intel isn't the only chipmaker expecting twins. Nearly every processor company has multiple-core plans. IBM has been selling dual-core chips for servers for a few years, while ARM sells dual-core chips for cell phones. Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices has said it will create chips with two, four and eight cores, too. Its first dual-core chip will also come out in 2005. Meanwhile, ClearSpeed has developed a 96-core chip for augmenting supercomputers, similar to chips from Japan's RIKEN and others. Nonetheless, Intel is the world's largest chipmaker, so the vast majority of the population will experience dual-core computing through its products. "This will be looked back upon in 10 years as the beginning of the new processor architectures," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. "The manufacturing challenge is not all that great. It is easier to do this than to do a complex single processor that's twice the size." As some companies start making dual-core chips by merging two of their single cores into one piece of silicon, they will begin to differentiate their products by adding different types of input-output mechanisms and other features, McCarron added. The first dual-core Intel chip for desktops, code-named Smithfield, will come out in desktops in 2005. Its first dual-core notebook chip, code-named Yonah, will begin shipping late in 2005 and likely won't appear in notebooks in any great numbers until 2006. A dual-core version of Itanium, called Montecito, will also debut in 2005 while Tulsa, a two-headed Xeon for servers, is set to come out in the first quarter of 2006. Smithfield will also be paired with a feature called Active Management Technology, which will allow an IT manager to control a PC remotely. If a PC is spitting out viruses, for example, an IT manager can shut it off with the management technology. "If you are going to curtail an outbreak, you want to contain it in a matter of minutes," said Justin Rattner, an Intel fellow. While volumes of dual-core chips will likely be small in 2005, they are expected to represent 70 percent of notebook and desktop of the chips produced by Intel by the end of 2006 and 85 percent of the server chips. Because of the additional core, Smithfield will initially be larger than its single-core predecessors and hence more expensive to manufacture, Smith said, but the chip will decrease in size over time. This pattern is typical in processors. Smithfield will be made on the current 90-nanometer manufacturing process, which means that the average size of features on the chip will measure 90 nanometers. Yonah will be made on the 65-nanometer process coming next year. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter. Smith also acknowledged that Intel's desktop and notebook chips, now quite distinct architecturally, will begin to converge. "Over time, these will look increasingly similar from a feature and capability perceptive--more so than they do now," Smith said. Among other things, "it makes for consistent software development." Software compatibility will not be a problem, Smith said. Microsoft's Windows XP is already designed to run on two processors. Many desktop applications have also already been tweaked to take advantage of hyperthreading, a technology in current Pentium 4s that lets a single chip do two actions at once, almost like a dual-core chip. Hyperthreading, in fact, will make dual-core chips seem like four-core chips. Servers will be able to take advantage of this feature, and hyperthreading will be a feature of dual-core Xeons and Itaniums. By contrast, hyperthreading may not be manifest in the early dual-core notebook and desktop chips, other Intel execs have said, because client applications haven't been tweaked to run on four processors yet. Still, while software development may be fairly straightforward, software licensing for dual-core and multicore processors has proven trickier, especially in servers. Despite Intel and AMD recommending that companies charge fees by the number of processors each server contains, regardless of how many cores each processor includes, some companies' policies dictate charging by the number of cores each processor in a given server contains.

2005-02-08 - Intel expanding 64-bit Xeon family In the next 90 days, Intel will begin selling a new line of Xeon processors that brings 64-bit abilities to multiprocessor servers, the chipmaker said Tuesday. Two versions of Xeon, code-named "Potomac" and "Cranford," are scheduled to arrive in systems in the next 90 days, Phil Brace, director of marketing for Intel's Digital Enterprise Group, said in a Tuesday interview. Intel first released the 64-bit feature, which vastly increases the amount of memory a server can use, in the "Nocona" Xeon model for dual-processor servers in 2004. But four-processor servers are more likely to run into the 4GB memory barrier of 32-bit processors. Rival Advanced Micro Devices beat Intel to the punch for 64-bit x86 chips. Intel still is the x86 server market leader, however, and by the end of February, the company will have shipped more than 2 million 64-bit x86 chips, Brace said. Intel's 64-bit chips also are vastly more popular than the company's higher-end 64-bit processor family, Itanium, which requires software to be revamped to run well. Intel debuted the Itanium family in 2001, but sold fewer than 200,000 of the chips in 2004. The processors are designed for four-processor servers, with Potomac geared for high-end work and Cranford for lower-priced machines. One major difference will be in the amount of high-speed cache memory; Potomac will include 8MB--an all-time high for Xeon processors--but Cranbrook will employ less, Brace said. Also Tuesday, Intel announced that in the next two weeks it will release a new Xeon for dual-processor servers and a new Pentium with 64-bit features. The Potomac and Cranford processors are at the heart of a new "platform" at Intel that also includes the new 8500 chipset--the supporting chips that handle communications with memory, network and the input-output subsystem. The 8500 is been code-named Twin Castle. Intel reorganized earlier this year in a move to tightly synchronize engineering and marketing for processors and chipsets, taking a page from its Centrino playbook for laptop computers. "We cannot deliver this technology piecemeal," Brace said. The 8500-based systems will introduce technology for the crucial 2006 transition to dual-core chips. For the first time, there will be two data pathways called front-side buses that connect the processor to the rest of the system. "As dual-core capabilities come into the market, this platform has been architected to take advantage of that," Brace said. Dual-core processors boost performance by combining two processing engines on a single slice of silicon. Though Intel will release dual-core desktop and notebook PCs this year, the dual-core Xeons aren't slated to arrive until early 2006. Also coming with the 8500 will be double data rate 2 (DDR2) memory, which is a smidgen faster but much more energy-efficient than the current DDR1; PCI Express input-output systems, which is faster than existing PCI connections; demand-based switching to lower processor speed and power consumption during idle moments; and memory reliability improvements; and technology to correct errors in data transferred within the system. The front-side bus will run at 667MHz compared to the current 400MHz speed, Brace said. Later this month, Intel will also launch a new family of 64-bit capable Pentium 4 processors for desktop PCs. The chips, part of Intel's new 600 series of Pentium 4 chips, will double current cache size to 2MB. In addition to the EM64T 64-bit extensions, Intel also fitted the Pentium 4 600 family with enhanced SpeedStep power management technology to reduce speed and power consumption, and with NX or no-execute support to help resist viruses and worms. The extra cache, and especially the 64-bit capabilities, promise more performance for PCs running multimedia and some other types of applications now and in the future, said Rob Crooke, vice president of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group. The chips will fit into manufacturers' existing PC lines, but are likely to come out first in their priciest, top-of-the-line models. CNET News.com's John Spooner contributed to this report.
2001-03-02 - Intel draws out Itanium arrival    SAN JOSE, Calif.--The slow arrival of Intel's upcoming Itanium processor for high-end servers just got a little slower. Though Intel will meet its most recent schedule set after a series of Itanium delays, servers incorporating the chip design may hit the market at a more gradual pace than earlier anticipated. In a keynote address Thursday at the Intel Developer Forum here, Mike Fister, general manager of the enterprise platforms group, said manufacturers would begin shipments of Itanium-based computers in the second quarter--but that "broader deployment" will happen in the second half of 2001. In July, Intel had said "general availability" of Itanium-based computers would be in the first half of 2000. Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood said the new schedule is "stretching" earlier announcements of availability. "At every stage, nothing on this program has happened as early as anybody expected," he said. Intel's Fister said computer manufacturers will unveil Itanium-based systems over a period of months. For example, IBM may introduce a Linux machine early, while Hewlett-Packard might unveil a system with its own HP-UX operating system a little later in the year, he said. Intel is in the middle of a years-long process to convert its power in the desktop computer processor market into similar dominance in the server world. The Itanium processor is Intel's flagship--albeit a battered one--in this effort. While Intel's Pentium chips are immensely popular for lower-end servers, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker has yet to displace the central processing units made by competitors Sun Microsystems, Compaq Computer, HP, IBM and SGI for high-end machines. The McKinley milestone Even Intel acknowledges that Itanium's second-generation successor, code-named McKinley, will probably be more useful to customers than its predecessor. During the keynote address Thursday, Fister said that although Itanium is useful for some e-commerce tasks, many customers will wait for McKinley to run high-end business software--such as that from SAP or Siebel Systems. But few discount Intel's power in the long run. For one thing, Intel's huge manufacturing complex allows the company to produce processors at a lower cost. The company also specializes in all-purpose designs and produces them in large quantities to be sold by as many manufacturers as possible. Brookwood expects the delay between McKinley prototypes and shipping products to be less than the delays between Itanium versions. The reason: Much of the difficulty of unveiling Itanium has been in preparing software and programming tools for the radically new chip design. That work won't have to be reproduced for McKinley, the analyst said. "If McKinley stays on target, the period between pilot and platform release will be considerably shorter because the software will have been shaken out a bit," Brookwood said. A lower-end CPU likely to gain more attention in the near term is Foster, the code name for the server version of the Pentium 4. Foster now is officially named Xeon, Fister said, as Intel has dropped the "Pentium" prefix that was part of the preceding Xeon line. Dual-processor workstations using Foster Xeon chips will arrive in the second quarter, while servers with two processors or more will arrive in the second half of the year, he said. Intel later this month will unveil the last Pentium III Xeon, running at 900MHz with 2MB of high-speed "cache" memory, he said. Packing in the power As expected, Fister also described plans for a new line of servers that cram increasing amounts of computing horsepower into racks of computers. Drawing on experience from its portable computers, Intel will build several CPUs and chipsets for this new type of "ultradense" server, Fister said. Mobile systems, like ultradense servers, have problems with minimizing power consumption and keeping faster processors cool. Intel will use the very same CPUs designed for laptops in the ultradense servers, Fister said in an interview with CNET News.com. The chips and chipsets Intel plans to create will run the power gamut, from full-featured, powerful chips to lower-power processors that don't have as much computing power, he said. The low-powered chipsets will arrive later this year, Fister said. Computer makers are likely to build their own chipsets as well as augment Intel chipsets with their own designs, he added. One ultradense server chipset, the 815em, will accommodate CPUs that need 2.56 watts of power and will accommodate a maximum of 512MB of memory. And the 440MX chipset will work with 2.1-watt systems with only 256MB of memory, Fister said. Intel also has two "Ketris" servers based on technology acquired when it bought Ziatech in August. One is 3.5 inches thick and holds four separate servers, while another is 15.75 inches thick and holds 16 servers. To InfiniBand and beyond Fister also took the opportunity during his keynote address to plug InfiniBand, an upcoming standard for connecting servers, storage systems and networks. Though two of the three InfiniBand demonstrations went awry, Fister assured the audience that InfiniBand technology is well on its way. By the end of this year, adapter cards for current servers will be available that will bring InfiniBand communications to server technology. InfiniBand support also will be built into McKinley-based systems, he said. InfiniBand will work alongside the current Ethernet network standard, not replace it, Fister added.
2001-01-17 - Intel developing new chip for lighter laptops  Intel is designing an entirely new mobile processor it plans to debut in 2002, raising its bet that notebooks will soon come to dominate the PC market. The new and as-yet-unnamed chip will be aimed at the so-called thin and light segment--laptops weighing less than 5 pounds. It will be sold alongside mobile versions of the company's Pentium 4 and Celeron chips. The increasingly popular slimmed-down notebooks represent a challenge for Intel, as they require processors that consume less power and consequently generate less heat. Low-power consumption has been one of the main drawing cards rival chipmaker Transmeta hopes to use to grab a chunk of the market. The chip, first mentioned at the Microprocessor Forum event last October, follows Intel's tradition of segmentation. Intel developed its Celeron and Xeon chips for low-cost PCs and PC servers. The company also created, despite delays, Itanium, its high-end server chip. Like the Itanium project, the new mobile chip will be a ground-up design effort. It will include a number of design tricks aimed at decreasing power consumption while increasing overall performance. But Intel has been tight-lipped about anything other than the chip's purpose. "As we anticipate the evolving needs of the mobile market, we said we'll develop more mobile-specific CPUs," said Don MacDonald, marketing director for Intel's Mobile Platforms Group. "We'll continue to design CPUs for each and every segment," MacDonald said. "We'll end up with two significant CPU designs rather than one that voltage regulates down" as the Pentium III does. Intel estimates it will need the new mobile chip by 2002. By then, the company estimates, some 60 percent to 65 percent of the notebook market will be made up of thin and light models. These notebooks will not have the internal capacity to handle the heat produced by a mobile Pentium 4 chip, analysts say. Intel's design philosophy for the new chip is to reduce power consumption as much as possible, without sacrificing performance. "How do you get performance without increasing heat and power? That's going to require a radical rethink," MacDonald acknowledged. Power junkies Intel's former Timna design team is familiar with big challenges. Based in Israel, the group is stewarding the new chip's design. Timna was Intel's ill-fated integrated Celeron processor. The chip would have featured a processor core, input and output controller, and graphics-processing engine in a single package aimed at reducing overall PC costs. But the chip was designed for expensive Rambus-based memory, which has yet to migrate to the low end of the PC market. Intel was forced to push Timna back as it designed a memory translator hub, a chip that would translate memory signals meant for Rambus memory to the more popular SDRAM. Problems with the hub, which forced Intel to recall some 1 million motherboards, eventually led to the cancellation of Timna. But it is likely that the former Timna team will put its knowledge to good use in designing the new chip. The team's primary goal is to reduce power consumption without compromising other factors, such as clock speed, MacDonald said. That means the team will likely combine several approaches by adding greater levels of feature integration and using a gated clock transistor design. Gated clock transistors can be turned off individually when not in use, thus reducing power consumption. Intel will also use voltage switching similar to its SpeedStep Technology, which reduces voltage and clock speed on mobile Pentium III chips when a notebook is using battery power, MacDonald said. The chip will be based on an optimized version of Intel's 0.13-micron manufacturing process. Analyst believe that Intel will likely base the design for the new chip on the mobile Pentium III processor core but will add new capabilities to it. "If you just crank up the (clock) frequency, you burn up a lot of power," said Kevin Krewell, senior analyst with MicroDesign Resources, in Sunnyvale, Calif. Krewell said Intel would likely go down a path of tweaking the Pentium III core to process a greater number of instructions per clock and also to increase clock speed. He said Intel will likely use a fairly large 512KB Level 2 cache as well as a new multimedia instruction set, possibly the Pentium 4's SSE-2. Intel's track record with Rambus memory has been less than successful so far. Krewell said the company likely will avoid another Timna fiasco by choosing Double Data Rate (DDR) SDRAM memory. The chipmaker will also integrate a memory controller for SDRAM into the chip to save space and power and cut memory latency, he added. "The real question is whether they'll pull graphics onboard," Krewell said. "Putting graphics onboard would limit the flexibility" of the chip. Instead, "something like what Transmeta's Crusoe is right now would be optimal for Intel," Krewell said. The Crusoe chip sports an onboard DDR memory controller but requires separate a I/O controller and graphics, giving it flexibility to be used in several different kinds of notebooks. The new mobile chip will compliment a forthcoming mobile version of the Pentium 4, based on Intel's 0.13-micron manufacturing process, which is code-named Northwood.
2006-03-07 - Intel demonstrates quad-core PC server SAN FRANCISCO--Intel demonstrated two quad-core processors Tuesday, "Clovertown" for servers and "Kentsfield" for PCs, directing attention toward the future during a more troubled present. Pat Gelsinger, a senior vice president in Intel's Digital Enterprise Group, demonstrated the processors during a speech at the company's Intel Developer Forum here. Both chips are built using Intel's 65-nanometer manufacturing process and will ship in the first quarter of 2007, Intel representatives said. The show comes as Intel faces market share losses to rival Advanced Micro Devices and financial troubles. Mainstream x86 chips with dual-processing engines began coming to market in 2005 and are becoming widely used. Quad-core models are the next step and a further indication that Intel's effort to improve performance focuses more on adding more cores than on increasing a chip's clock speed. One factor could affect the take-up of chips with four cores, however. Although servers often run software whose tasks are divided into multiple threads that can take advantage of multicore processors, PC software is not so amenable to the approach. "Dual-core makes sense right away, because there's almost some back task that's executing while you're trying to do something else," said Roger Kay, president of analyst firm Endpoint Technologies Associates. But quad-core PCs initially will be "a niche, for sure," appealing only to power users with heavy-duty computing tasks such as digital rendering or computer-aided design, he said. More interest is likely to come for Conroe, a dual-core processor for desktop PCs due in the second half of the year. "It delivers 40 percent more performance while taking 40 percent less power," compared with current Pentium chips, Gelsinger said. It's not clear what approach Intel will take to achieving four cores, however. AMD's version will have all four processor cores integrated on a single slice of silicon. But Intel, in the past, has taken a less sophisticated approach that puts two separate cores into a single package that plugs into a processor socket. Using that measure, IBM's Power5+ server chip is already there with its Quad-Core Module option. Dempsey and low-power Xeon Gelsinger also showed two nearer-term server processors that both fit into the same "Bensley" platform that Clovertown eventually will fit into. The first, "Dempsey," is now in production and will ship this month, Gelsinger said. The second, "Woodcrest," uses a new processor design and is due in the third quarter, said Kirk Skaugen, general manager of Intel's Server Platforms Group. Woodcrest had been scheduled for the fourth quarter, but Intel was able to pull in the schedule by one quarter, Skaugen said in an interview. It will run at 3GHz, while Dempsey will top out at 3.73GHz, the upper range of where Intel had hoped, he added. Those speeds, combined with Dempsey's 667MHz memory and Woodcrest's 1333MHz memory--and the sooner-than-planned arrival of virtualization technology--shows that Intel's engineers are getting things right. "All that is an engineering execution proof point," a bullish Skaugen said. Though AMD has made gains, Intel's technology will prevail again: "We have leadership in performance and in performance per watt. That's what people care about. It'll be undisputed as we get into the Woodcrest timeframe." Woodcrest will arrive on the heels of Dempsey, but Intel doesn't consider it a replacement. Instead, the company is likely to market both, Skaugen said: Dempsey for small businesses as primarily concerned with price and Woodcrest for big companies as primarily concerned with performance per watt. Skaugen also said a low-voltage Xeon LV processor, "Sossaman," will ship next week. The dual-core processor is based on the newest Core Duo laptop chip and consumes 31 watts compared to more than 130 watts for regular Xeons. IBM is using the Xeon LV in its BladeCenter servers, but its top rival in the x86 server market, Hewlett-Packard, is passing over Sossaman. "It's an old technology, based on the Lindenhurst chipset," used in the soon-to-be replaced fourth-generation ProLiant servers, HP spokesman Tim Kreuger said Tuesday. Another reason HP isn't using it is that Sossaman lacks 64-bit support. "It's a very targeted product for a small part of market," he said. Dempsey servers will ship in the latter half of the second quarter, but are due to be replaced almost immediately by the Woodcrest models that offer significant improvements in the key domain of lower power consumption. "Intel does not really have a competitive product today" in the server market, Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff said. Intel apparently decided that "having a reasonable, if not industry-leading, processor like Dempsey was better than not having anything for three or four months." But things look better with the next-generation processor core coming from Intel on which Woodcrest is based, Haff said. "Those do not appear to be cherry-picked numbers of some particular benchmark on a blue moon with a tailwind blowing," Haff said. Dempsey includes support for Intel Virtualization Technology, which makes it easier to run multiple operating systems simultaneously and thereby to increase server efficiency. On Tuesday, Intel announced its specification for extending virtualization to a computer's input-output subsystem, a next step in making the technology useful. AMD announced its I/O virtualization specification in February. Diane Greene, the president of leading virtual machine software company VMware, said the EMC subsidiary will support Intel's I/O virtualization in products in 2007. Intel has had difficulties in the other half of its server chip line, Itanium, with a significant delay of the first dual-core model, "Montecito." The chip had been scheduled to arrive in 2005, but Intel in October delayed it until mid-2006. On Tuesday, Gelsinger said the processor will ship in the second quarter of the year.
2003-07-22 - Intel debuts wireless software tools   Intel introduced on Tuesday its first set of compiler programs for wireless devices powered by its XScale processors and built on the Intel Personal Internet Client Architecture. Compilers are software tools that filter data written in a particular programming language and transform the information into code understood by the microprocessor in any given device. Software developers use compilers to translate programming languages such as C++ into the language that can be read by a particular processor. Intel announced earlier this year that it would release a series of compilers to help increase performance of applications written for use in devices built around its processors. Company executives said the new compilers are for use with Microsoft's eMbedded Visual C++ programming language and Intel's Pentium 4, Xeon and Itanium 2 processor product lines. Intel said it launched the compilers to offer software developers a consistent set of tools for use in building applications on mobile computing devices based on the company's chips. "Availability of these new compilers means developers have tools to improve the performance of applications spanning Intel-based mobile and wireless devices, desktops and servers," Jon Khazam, general manager of Intel's Software Products Division, said in a statement. Intel claims that applications built using the compilers offer improved graphics, increased interactivity and stronger communications capabilities with other devices implemented in networks. The company said the compilers enhance the performance of productivity applications, games and cell phones. The compilers are available in two forms: The Intel C++ Compiler for Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ is available from Intel for $399, and is intended for applications development. The Intel C++ Compiler for Platform Builder for Microsoft Windows CE.Net is available for $1,499 and is intended for use by device manufacturers and systems integrators.
2004-08-23 - Intel cuts Pentium 4 prices    Intel on Sunday dropped prices on a range of Pentium 4 processors, some by more than a third. The fastest version of the chip, the 3.6GHz Pentium 4 560, dropped by 35 percent from $637 to $417. The 3.4GHz Pentium 4 550 slipped by 33 percent from $417 to $278. The 3.2GHz Pentium 4 540 dipped 22 percent from $278 to $218. The 3GHz Pentium 4 530 is down 18 percent, from $218 to $178. Intel's prices reflect chips purchased in 1,000-unit lots by PC makers. Thus street prices for individual chips purchased by consumers vary and are often higher. Intel lowers its prices on a fairly regular basis, often in order to make room for new processors or to stimulate demand. This price shift was the first one for its latest generation of numbered Pentium 4s, which emerged in June, along with its latest crop of supporting chips, the 915 Express and 925 Express chipsets. The lower price for Intel's 3.6GHz Pentium 4 560 may ring hollow for some, however. The chip has proved difficult to find since its introduction in June. Meanwhile, the chipmaker lowered prices by similar percentages on its older Pentium 4s, including chips such as the 3.4GHz and 3.4EGHz Pentium 4, which now cost $278, down 33 percent from $417. Those chips have been on the market much longer than the numbered Pentium 4s. Intel, likewise, cut some mobile Pentium 4 prices by margins that ranged from 14 percent to 20 percent. The 3.2GHz mobile Pentium 4 538 dipped by 20 percent from $294 to $234, for example. The company's 3.4GHz and 3.6GHz Pentium 4 with EMT64 for workstations and servers saw similar price reductions, dropping by 33 percent to $278 and 35 percent to $417, respectively. EMT64 is the name for Intel's version of 64-bit memory-addressing technology. Meanwhile, Intel also lowered prices on several of its desktop Celeron chips by 7 percent to 12 percent. The 2.8GHz Celeron 335, for example, dropped 12 percent from $117 to $103. The chipmaker enacted price cuts of up to 32 percent on some of its Itanium 2 server processors. The 1.3GHz Itanium 2 with 3MB of cache, for example, was ratcheted down 32 percent from $1,338 to $910, while the 1.4GHz with 4MB of cache dropped by 12 percent from $2,247 to $1,980. AMD, Intel's rival in the PC chip business, last adjusted its prices in late July. The adjustment saw many Athlon XP and Athlon 64 prices go lower, but a few of the chips' prices increased slightly, as AMD adjusted its list prices to reflect chips sold in kits to distributors compared with those sold bare and direct to PC makers.
2004-04-13 - Intel cuts Itanium fat with new chips tech Intel announced on Monday two new Itanium processors for two-processor servers, another step in the company's efforts to eliminate price as a barrier to Itanium acceptance. The 1.4GHz Itanium 2 with 3MB of cache is designed for servers in clusters. The new chip will provide about 25 percent more performance and cost much less than the initial Itanium optimized for clusters, which came out last year, said Jason Waxman, director of multiprocessor platform marketing at Intel. The second new chip, a 1.6GHz Itanium 2 with 3MB of cache, is optimized for higher performance in general-use two-processor servers, he said. Waxman reiterated that Intel is working on several technologies that will eliminate any price premium on Itanium by 2007 and thereby allow its performance advantages to, hopefully, blossom. "The price/performance balance will be heavily in favor of Itanium," Waxman said. With the focus on price, the Itanium melodrama is once again reaching a turning point. After several years of delays, the chip family debuted in 2001 to poor reviews and negligible customer acceptance. A second version of the chip that appeared in 2002 dramatically improved performance but failed to spark the market. Itanium finally began to gain acceptance in 2003 with Madison, a new version of Itanium 2 that substantially improved performance again and lowered the cost. Intel shipped about 100,000 Itaniums in 2003, compared with only around a few thousand for the first two years. Itanium volume is expected to double this year, CEO Craig Barrett said in February. But in 2004, Intel announced that it would come out with a version of its Xeon chip that runs both 32- and 64-bit code. Xeon and Pentium chips typically run 32-bit code. Itanium runs 64-bit code, which, among other advantages, lets a computer maker pack far more memory into a computer. Itanium, however, requires completely different software to work well, a factor that has hindered adoption. Part of the appeal of the Opteron chip is that it can handle larger memory loads in 64-bit mode on essentially the same software base. Lowering the cost of Itanium servers won't eliminate the software issue, but it will begin to create an environment in which greater acceptance could occur, which in turn could cause software developers to gravitate to Itanium. Analysts and PC makers have viewed this theory with various doses of skepticism, but the range of opinion is generally substantially less negative than it was 18 months ago. Price drops have already had some effect. In 2002, a two-processor Itanium server cost about $18,000. With the new chips, a similarly configured system can sell for less than $8,000, while basic one-processor Itanium servers will go for just more than $2,000. Some of these price cuts have come as a result of Moore's Law, which predicts that the number of transistors on a chip will double every 18 months. But Intel has also expanded its product line to better suit the economic realities of two-processor servers. The company also designs and partly manufacturers many of the Itanium servers on the market, which cuts independent engineering costs. To lower the price further, Intel will begin to create products and add features to Itanium so that Itanium servers can be made out of many of the same components as Xeon servers. In 2005 and 2006, Itanium servers will be able to use the same memory or other components of Xeon servers, Waxman said. In 2005, Intel will also come out with two different chipsets for Montecito, the next major version of the chip. One chipset will wring maximum performance out of the chip, Waxman said, while the other will allow server makers to insert Montecito into their Madison-based servers, thereby cutting down independent design efforts. By 2007, Intel will release a common chipset that can work with either Itanium or Xeon servers, similar to what IBM did with its Summit chipset. The 1.4GHz Itanium 2 comes out Monday for $1,172 in 1,000-unit quantities. A 1.6GHz version comes out in May for $2,408 in similar quantities.
2008-10-23 - Intel 'corrects' executives who slammed iPhone Updated 4:30pm with additional background on the ongoing saga of Apple and Intel. Intel issued a "correction" Thursday regarding comments one of its executives made earlier this week slamming the iPhone as incapable of working correctly with the Internet. It's hard to see this as anything other than an formal apology to Apple and ARM for comments made by Intel's Shane Wall and Pankaj Kedia at the company's Intel Developer Forum in Taipei, as reported by our sister site ZDNet Australia. Among other things, the executives resurrected Intel's lame "ARM chips can't handle the Internet" argument and singled out the iPhone as an example of a smartphone that could be really awesome if it only used one of Intel's low-power x86 architecture processors, known as Atom. But in a posting to Intel's Chip Shots blog Thursday afternoon, Anand Chandrasekher, the head of Intel's low-power efforts, threw his fellow executives under the bus in admitting that Intel's current low-power x86 processors don't even come close to matching the power consumption numbers--a vital design parameter in smartphones--of those made by ARM's partners, which are used in smartphones like the iPhone and over 90 percent of all the mobile phones in the world. The post follows in its entirety. Anand Chandrasekher issued a correction on comments made by members of his team yesterday at Intel's Developer Forum in Taiwan. As general manager of the Group responsible for Intel's ultra-mobility products, he acknowledged that Intel's low-power Atom processor does not yet match the battery life characteristics of the ARM processor in a phone form factor; and, that while Intel does have plans on the books to get us to be competitive in the ultra low power domain - we are not there as yet. Secondly, Apple's iPhone offering is an extremely innovative product that enables new and exciting market opportunities. The statements made in Taiwan were inappropriate, and Intel representatives should not have been commenting on specific customer designs. Whoops. Apple has made it pretty clear that it doesn't buy Intel's argument that since the PC-based Internet experience runs on x86-architecture processors, the best way to bring that experience to the mobile world is to adopt x86 processors. Apple purchased the engineers of P.A. Semi earlier this year to start working on processors based on ARM's cores for future iPhones and iPod Touches, rather than waiting for Intel's Moorestown product--the chip Chandrasekher was referring to in his post--to arrive. Intel has been making this argument for over a year, but it had avoided slamming high-profile ARM-based smartphones such as the iPhone during extremely public events like IDF. And now we know why; a certain Apple executive said to be close friends with a certain Intel executive was unlikely to be pleased by Intel's comments just as Apple was reporting blowout iPhone sales. The apology raises the question of just how strained the relationship between the world's largest chip maker and Apple, who have now been partners for a little over three years, has become this year. For the most part, the relationship has been mutually beneficial. Apple got the notebook processors it desperately needed to upgrade the iMac and the MacBook, as well as a totally committed chip partner, and the results have been stellar. For its part, Intel hooked up with a partner that wasn't totally dependent on the chip company for innovation and that had dramatically more sex appeal than Hewlett-Packard, Dell, or Acer. Ever since June 2005, Intel executives have been positively giddy about their relationship with Apple, p jointly developed by the style wizards in Cupertino and the engineering wizards in Santa Clara and Oregon. The two companies were said to have engineering staffs that bonded over a common love for innovation, and Intel salespeople were ecstatic at showing off how their technology could be used in leading-edge designs. But Apple doesn't toe Intel's line the way the rest of the PC industry does. It doesn't need Intel's marketing war chest, it doesn't need its cadre of design engineers, and it doesn't need Intel's brightly colored stickers to help sell its products, as CEO Steve Jobs reminded the poor reporter who dared ask last year why Apple doesn't participate in the Intel Inside program. Apple has shown that it is quite willing to follow its own path. The purchase of P.A. Semi was a clear signal that Apple had taken a look at Intel's future road map for low-power processors, and decided it had to take matters into its own hands regarding future chips for the iPhone and iPod Touch. And while Apple is unlikely to dump Intel's processors anytime soon from the Mac lineup--especially given the struggles of Advanced Micro Devices this year--its decision to use Nvidia's integrated graphics chipsets in the newest editions of the MacBook underscores what everyone in the PC industry knew anyway: Intel's integrated graphics chipsets are the bottom of the barrel. Meanwhile, the Intel-based gadgets co-designed by Apple and the chipmaker are nowhere to be found. Intel had probably hoped that it could sell Apple on the Netbook or Mobile Internet Device concepts that it has been flogging for the past two years, but Apple has sensibly concentrated its efforts on the iPhone and Mac rather than helping Intel get its ideas for mobile computing off the ground. So where does that leave the two companies? They'll be fine, although Intel is sleeping on the couch tonight. This week's exercise, however, is an interesting example of how much power Apple wields over one of the most important and historic companies in technology. Intel has never apologized for slamming IBM's Power server chip--a competitor to its Itanium processor--while simultaneously selling IBM Xeon chips for a different class of servers. But one offhand remark surfaces about Jobs' iPhone, and Intel bends over backward to smooth things over.
2003-09-16 - Intel chips to do double duty  SAN JOSE, Calif.--In the future, Intel's processors will have split personalities. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker wants to take advantage of the huge number of transistors on the microprocessors coming out in the next few years. The company plans to produce chips with two or more processor cores--the calculating engine inside a chip--and make chips that can function as two processors, company President Paul Otellini said Tuesday morning at the Intel Developer Forum here. A chip technology that will be available within five years, code-named Vanderpool, will allow users to partition the processor inside their computers. In a demonstration, Otellini used a PC to beam an episode of "The Simpsons" to a plasma TV, while another Intel executive booted and rebooted a game with the same machine. "What we are doing is creating virtual machines inside the microprocessor," Otellini said. "You can run multiple versions of Windows or different operating systems." Conversely, Intel will release Montecito, an Itanium chip that will be Intel's first dual-core processor, in 2005 and follow it with Tanglewood, a future version of the Itanium family of chips for servers that will contain multiple cores. The dual-core concept also will show up in the Xeon line in the form of Tulsa, which will be released in about three years. Xeon is based on the traditional x86 architecture, which differs from the Itanium architecture. Security technology LaGrande also will split functions inside a PC. Working in conjunction with Microsoft's Next Generation Secure Computing Platform, LaGrande will prevent hackers from using keyboard "sniffers" to steal passwords or scrape data such as credit card numbers from screens. The technology works by processing confidential data in a different manner. Hooked on wireless Otellini reiterated Intel's familiar themes about the growth of wireless and the convergence of computing and communications. Currently, a wireless access point is installed every 4 seconds, he said, and a new wireless client gets activated every second. During his speech, he showed off a prototype handheld called the Universal Communicator that can automatically switch between Wi-Fi and different cellular networks. By 2010, around 1.5 billion PCs will be hooked up to broadband networks and there will be around 2.5 billion handhelds connected to broadband networks that contain processors that are as powerful as today's fastest Pentium 4, he said. Otellini said Intel will come out with low-power versions of 802.11 chips. Earlier in the week, Broadcom announced a similar product. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. Technological progress will ultimately rely on following Moore's Law, which states that the number of transistors on a chip double every two years. More transistors lead to greater performance and capability. "In so many ways, you can't fight Moore's Law," Otellini said. Intel will continue to follow that maxim for years. The company will begin to ship chips made on the 90-nanometer manufacturing process by the end of this year. (Ninety nanometers refers to the average feature size of components on a chip. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.) The company also has produced wafers on the 65-nanometer process, transistors on the 45-nanometer process, and prototype transistors for the 32- and 22-nanometer processes. That will take the company to 2011. Intel will continue to increasingly look at the developing world for sales. North America now accounts for around half of the installed base of PCs. That will shrink to a quarter toward the end of the decade. To better penetrate developing countries, however, Intel will have to redesign its products and lower the price points to suit these economies. In some countries, consumers may want to use a TV screen instead off a regular monitor. Increasing sales in those regions may involve coming up with new, derivative versions of the company's current chips. "How do you bring value to people who have household incomes that are less than the cost of a PC?" Otellini asked. Intel is hiring in these markets to better plumb market conditions.
2001-08-10 - Intel chip not ready for the cool crowd    Although manufacturers are demanding server processors that produce less heat, Intel said Friday that a low-powered version of its 64-bit Itanium chip is still several years off. The server chip, launched earlier this year, is designed to tackle high-performance tasks such as processing vast databases. But server manufacturers are increasingly demanding low-power chips for the rack-mounted servers that fill data centers--and Itanium generates too much heat to fit inside these so-called high-density devices. Alan Priestley, strategic marketing manager for Intel's European enterprise marketing group, said Intel does not have plans to fit Itanium or other IA-64 chips into high-density servers for at least a year, if not more. Demand for the rack-mountable "pizza box" servers is coming from several directions: companies looking to consolidate their servers into one physical space, for instance, and telecommunications companies that are putting data centers around the fringes of their networks. Web-hosting companies particularly benefit from the high-density model, which is suited for handling high volumes of server requests. Priestly conceded that high density is driving server growth. "It's a rapidly emerging sector of the market. It's an area that's growing very fast," he said. But Itanium is designed for pedestal servers. For one, it needs an unusual amount of cooling equipment, filling about two-thirds of the space inside the box. Itanium dissipates 130 watts, far more than Sun's UltraSparc III, which has been moved to a 0.15-micron technology and dissipates 75 watts. Intel's current top high-density product is the 1.13GHz Pentium III 512k, a new version of the Pentium III chip that shrinks the manufacturing geometry from 0.18-micron to 0.13-micron, reducing power consumption and heat dissipation. Pentium 4 will get the 0.13-micron treatment later, beginning to push it into the high-density range. But though Intel has demonstrated a concept of a pizza-box 1U server based on Itanium's successor--McKinley--that processor won't arrive for at least a year. And while engineers at Hewlett-Packard, Dell Computer and other manufacturers are pushing Intel to come up with a lower-power version of the Itanium, Intel says it is impossible. "Future generations of Itanium will use high density, but not the current generation," Priestley said. "There is no way to get the current processor into a 1U form factor. You couldn't do it because of the physical constraints of the processor." Some engineers and analysts have suggested that the performance of Itanium or its successors will have to be crippled to bring heat emissions to a manageable level, but Priestley dismissed the idea. "You have to do a lot more than step down performance to decrease watts," he said. "Everything we're doing now is to drive MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and keep watts down, and we don't want to drop that. "We've just brought the product to market, and it'll be a little while yet before we're optimizing it for watts and not MIPS," he said. Instead of performance cuts, Intel will look to new process technologies to bring power usage down. McKinley will shift the IA-64 line to a 0.13-micron process, and the process will later move to 0.1 microns. A version code-named Deerfield, set for late 2002 or early 2003, will probably be Intel's first attempt to optimize IA-64 for power consumption over performance. Intel's emerging connection technology, InfiniBand, will also give a boost to high-density Itanium servers. With InfiniBand, which will begin to be generally used next year, Intel plans to take components like storage out of the server box, leaving more room for the extra cooling equipment, as well as the additional memory that 64-bit chips require. Intel is downplaying the demand for 64-bit computing in the high-density market, saying that at the moment the greatest demand for features like memory and floating-point performance is still in midtier to back-end systems. "There is enough headroom still in the 32-bit space to drive forward into the high-density market," Priestley said. Staff writer Matthew Broersma reported from London.
2003-12-18 - Intel changes code name of future Itanium  Tanglewood, thy name is Tukwila. To avoid a trademark dispute, Intel has changed the code name of Tanglewood, a version of its Itanium expected to come out after 2005 that will contain several processor cores, to Tukwila, an Intel spokesman said. Since it is just a code name, Intel decided to switch rather than fight. The old name is associated with the famous Tanglewood Music Center in Massachusetts, said an Intel spokesman. Many of the engineers working on the project came to Intel from Massachusetts-based Digital Equipment and live and work in the state. Tukwila is a town in Washington about 15 minutes away from Seattle. The mayor's name is Steven Mullet. Intel typically selects geographic place names for code names to avoid copyright and trademark disputes. Many of the code names derive from towns in the Pacific Northwest, but other names are creeping in. The Pentium M chips carry Israeli code names such as Dothan and Banias because the chips are designed in Israel. Other companies follow similar practices. In the late 1990s, Advanced Micro Devices derived some of its code names from characters in the cartoon "The Land Before Time." An engineer's kid liked the show and got to name the chips, according to sources. Later, it paid homage to American muscle cars like Corvette and Mustang. The car manufacturers, however, complained and now the chips are given code names such as Newcastle. Although sales of Itanium chips were slow for the first two years, there has been an uptick in the market. Intel President Paul Otellini said in November that over 100,000 Itanium chips will have been shipped by the end of 2003.
2000-08-22 - Intel CEO says Sun model doomed    SAN JOSE, Calif.--The Berlin Wall came down long ago, but the specter of communism still looms as long as Sun Microsystems is around, Intel CEO Craig Barrett joked during an interview at Intel?s Developer Forum. Sun, which designs the hardware, software and processors that go into its servers, represents an increasingly outmoded way of doing business because it locks corporate customers into products or services from a single seller, Barrett said. By contrast, the "horizontal" PC market, where different companies sell interchangeable products based on common standards, lets customers shop around and will emerge victorious. "The horizontal makes much more progress than the vertical market. You just have to look at Sun," Barrett said with a laugh. "If (Sun CEO) Scott McNealy's model worked, communism would still be prevalent and challenging capitalism." Hyperbole aside, Sun represents the future challenge for Intel. Although Intel?s largest direct competitor remains Advanced Micro Devices, Sun will likely emerge as a prominent, visible antagonist in coming years. Sun leads the market for expensive, highly profitable servers for running e-commerce sites and business-to-business transaction services. That's a market that Intel wants to enter with its Itanium processor. Compaq Computer, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, among others, also want to put a dent in the 40 percent-plus growth Sun has seen in recent quarters. Sun?s McNealy and many of the PC companies have traded verbal barbs for years. Sun and Intel, however, had a nasty split six months ago over a now-defunct plan to bring Sun?s Solaris operating system to Intel?s Itanium chip. Intel claimed Sun was not dedicating the necessary resources to the project, while Sun said Intel overreacted. "Sun is going to get a lot of competition in their area of strength, which is the back office," Barrett said. "It wasn't the horizontal marketplace that brought eBay to its knees. The horizontal marketplace can provide just as good reliability as Sun." One of the advantages of the horizontal market is that, combined, a horizontal industry spends more research dollars than a single company. Historically, consumers also have gravitated away from vertical markets. "If the vertical market was successful, Apple would have 95 percent of the market rather than 4 percent," Barrett quipped. Barrett, who had just returned from fighting fires at his ranch in Montana, also said Intel has worked to shore up some loose ends at the company. On the acquisition side, Intel has begun to take a less heavy-handed approach toward changing cultures and processes at these companies. Rather than indoctrinate these new acquisitions right away, Intel has allowed the integration process to become more open-ended. "We've gotten quite better at it. We no longer smother our acquisitions," Barrett said. "You acquire people for the technology they have, the knowledge they have, and (you) keep all of it...If an acquired company has a different sales model or a different HR structure, there is not reason to slap them around...We are much more adaptable." As part of the integration process, the company appoints a proxy general manager from inside of Intel to teach new acquisitions the formal and informal rules of life at the company. Intel has also moved to correct manufacturing and planning problems, which helped cause a processor shortage that has lingered for nearly 10 months. The company simply didn?t anticipate demand correctly last year, Barrett said. Some products also had to be delayed because of defects. "I don't believe (Intel had) bad luck in that stuff...We kind of dropped the ball," he said. "We have been embarrassed by the slips and are dedicated not to have a continuing episode of these slips."
2005-11-14 - Intel brings virtualization to the desktop Intel is set to launch Monday new desktop processors that can subdivide tasks in a hardware feature called Virtualization Technology, or VT. While VT is currently found in some of Intel's Xeon processors for servers, this is the first time that the chipmaking giant has extended the technology to the desktop via its Pentium line. VT makes it easier to run multiple operating systems or applications in independent partitions or "containers" on the same chip, said Chad Taggard, Intel's director of technology marketing. Intel is offering two Pentium 4 chips that are VT enabled. The 672 and 662 are shipping in desktops from Asian PC makers Acer, Founder, Lenovo and TongFang. The Intel processors are priced at $605 and $401 respectively, in 1,000-unit quantities. Beyond the single-core Pentium 4, Intel is expected to enable its dual-core Pentium D to run VT in the first quarter of 2006. By the first half of next year, Intel expects to fill out the rest of its product line including its next-generation Xeon and Itanium server processors as well as its Pentium M line for laptops, Taggard said. "We are starting out with releasing VT on a single-core Pentium because some government and IT agencies have standards that do not validate dual core as of yet and we want them to still take advantage of virtualization," Taggard said. For consumers, Taggard said the VT technology could prevent some basic computer foul-ups. For example, playing games or chatting through instant messaging with friends could be partitioned on a separate section of the computer, Taggard said. "And when the machine turns off, that personal information is destroyed and does not carry on to the other partition," he said. The security of online banking could also improve because a partitioned interaction would be erased after use, rendering some spyware ineffective. For dual-processor servers, VT support will arrive with the Dempsey dual-core processor due out in the first quarter of 2006. Advanced Micro Devices plans to introduce its equivalent technology, code-named Pacifica, in the first half of 2006. "A company can update a PC's security software or other applications in the background without the user having to stop their work," Taggard said. "Each client could have a partition so that virus updates could be handled as the problem arises. Businesses can better protect themselves from viruses by filtering network traffic through a separate partition before it reaches the user." The feature is also designed to improve the performance and flexibility of software such as VMware's ESX Server, Microsoft's Virtual PC, and the open-source Xen project. All three entities have lent their support to Intel's endeavors, Taggard said. The feature is one of the chipmaking giant's extensions sometimes referred to as a "Star Ts" or *Ts, Taggard said, which Intel plans on combining. Intel's VT is expected to complement another Intel technology--Active Management Technology--on dual-core Intel business processors code-named Averill, later in 2006.

2002-01-11 - Intel BMC fund Linux company   Chipmaker Intel and mainframe software company BMC Software have joined others in a $14 million investment in Aduva, a company that seeks to simplify installation and management of Linux systems, the company said Wednesday. Returning investors in the third-round funding include Cap Ventures, Evergreen Management and the Capital Group, the company said. The Intel investment came from its Intel 64 Fund, which seeks to boost the prospects of its newly released 64-bit Itanium family of high-end processors. And through its investment, BMC now has the right to package and resell Aduva's products, including jointly developed software for IBM's zSeries mainframes, which now can run the Linux operating system.
2006-03-24 - Intel acknowledges Itanium flubs predicts strong future    SANTA CLARA, Calif.--A top Intel executive acknowledged significant problems with Itanium but said Thursday that the company is increasing investments in the high-end chip family to brighten its future. "I'm not happy with our sales figures, I'm not happy with our execution delays, I'm not happy with our killed projects," said Pat Gelsinger, senior vice president of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group. But at the same time, Itanium server sales are more than half of Sun Sparc server sales and a third of IBM Power server sales, and there are new customers and partnerships such as a major deal with computing technology supplier Electronic Data Systems. "Do I feel good or bad? The answer is yes," Gelsinger said in an interview at Intel headquarters here. Itanium may have grown more slowly than Intel initially expected and hoped, but it's no different than other major server designs, said Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini. "We looked at the unit ramp of Power, Sparc and Itanium set to time zero. We're right on their curves from first shipments," Otellini said. And transitions are necessarily slow when it comes to large servers, Otellini said. "In the mainframe space, you're displacing 10- to 20-year-old architectures; it's a marathon." Intel and Hewlett-Packard, the initiator of the Itanium project and its biggest advocate, have begun trying to take the offensive with the chip family. The new assertiveness includes $10 billion in Itanium technology and market development spending through 2010. Half of that is coming from HP. Intel has had troubles with Itanium--most recently the delay of "Montecito," the first dual-core model and a product Intel says will double performance over its "Madison" predecessor. But the company has increased internal spending on engineers so future designs--"Montvale" due in 2007, "Tukwila" in 2008, and "Poulson" some time after that. After the agreement in which HP's Itanium design team moved to Intel, "We did a top-down look" at Itanium, Gelsinger said. "We looked at the road map--the embarrassment of Montecito--where we needed to be with Montvale, with Tukwila, with Poulson, and what does it take to execute." Consequently, Intel has been hiring engineers in Fort Collins, Colo., and Massachusetts. "We have not been more specific in terms of how much we incremented," he said, but it should help Intel with "better execution, credibility and predictability."
2005-01-20 - Intel accelerates virtual-desktop plans    Intel will begin to implement technology that will let a user run two operating systems on the same PC this year, an acceleration of the timetable that better matches its chip plans. Vanderpool essentially divides the resources inside a single PC or server so that it can function like two or more independent machines. Virtualization technology like this is already common in the server market, and Intel had plans to bring it to its Itanium chip this year. Initially, Vanderpool wasn't slated to come to desktops until 2006. Now, it will come out in desktop chipsets and processors in 2005. The company also released a preliminary specification on Thursday. Intel will also release dual-core processors later this year. Vanderpool dovetails with these types of chips. Dual-core processors are made to perform two separate functions at once: Virtualization software can help balance the computing needs of each processing core with the software and other hardware inside the box. Vanderpool is part of a family of enhancements Intel has been adding to its chips to improve overall computing performance or versatility without necessarily increasing power consumption. Hyperthreading, the first in the series of improvements, allows a chip to handle multiple functions at once. Another coming in the near future, called Active Management Technology, or AMT, will enable an administrator to shut down a PC remotely if it is spitting out viruses.
1999-12-22 - Intel accelerates plans to release high-speed chips    On Monday Intel released the 800-MHz Pentium III processor ahead of its original schedule, and apparently that's just the tip of the iceberg. The Santa Clara, Calif., manufacturer has advanced its "road map" for 2000, and will come out with 850-MHz and 866-MHz Pentium IIIs in the year's first quarter, according to a presentation obtained by the HardOCP hardware discussion site. In addition, a 1-GHz Pentium III has been added to the chip giant's plans and is scheduled to appear in the fourth quarter of 2000. Intel declined to comment on unannounced plans. But moving up the release dates of these and other chips is in line with the company's previous response to increased competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices. "That's absolutely consistent with this week's actions," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood, referring to Monday's announcement of the top-end 800-MHz Pentium III. "Intel always has to have in reserve three or four speed grades so they can continue the quarterly progression that has become a fact of the market." The flagship Pentium III will make a pit stop at 933 MHz in the third quarter while Celeron, the processor for budget computers, will rise to speeds of 633 MHz and beyond next year. A processor with integrated graphics capabilities, code-named Timna, will debut at the end of the third quarter at 600 MHz. In addition, a host of chipsets, the silicon which serves as a bridge between the processor and the rest of the computer, will come out as well, according to the document. These chipsets will run at 100 MHz and 133 MHz and will work with Rambus memory or standard memory running at different speeds. The main reason for the advanced schedule is Athlon,  AMD's performance processor. The chip has received rave reviews from benchmark testers, who have noted that Athlons and Pentium III run neck-and neck with AMD taking the edge in certain tests but losing in others. Perhaps more important, AMD has not hit any debilitating manufacturing snags, a problem the company had in the past. As a result, Intel is pushing its monster-sized, worldwide manufacturing capabilities to pump out faster chips in less time than ever before. "They are really concerned about AMD," said Linley Gwennap, publisher of the Microprocessor Report. "AMD has Intel sweating." Perhaps deliberately, Intel sprang the news of the 800-MHz chip at the beginning of a two-week holiday at AMD, whose representatives were not available for comment. "It's getting to be like with Clinton and Congress," when the president makes announcements when Congress isn't in session, Brookwood quipped. However, Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD "clearly is positioned to come back with an 800-MHz product early in the year," likely before Jan. 6, Brookwood said. The arrival of the 1-GHz Pentium III is also interesting, Brookwood said. "There was general concern that the current Coppermine core would max out at 933 MHz," he said. Coppermine is the newest Pentium III design, introduced in October. The Intel chip road map also shows a growing gap between the higher-end Pentium III chips and their lower-end Celeron brethren. The clock speed difference between the two lines was only 100 MHz at the beginning of this quarter, with Celerons running at 500 MHz and Pentium IIIs at 600 MHz. But a year from now that gap will be more than 300 MHz, when Pentium IIIs will have hit 1 GHz but the Celeron will still be in the 600-MHz range. In addition, the Pentium IIIs will benefit from a faster system for communicating with memory. Intel wants to let the development pace of the Celerons slow down to make sure they don't compete with high-end chips with comparable performance, Brookwood said. "It got to be a problem, with clock rates at the low end more or less tracking what was at the high end. It was getting hard to defend [buying] an $800 processor when you could get a $150 processor that seemingly had the same level of performance." With AMD mostly focusing on the high end, Intel can be a bit more complacent with the Celerons, Brookwood said. Still, AMD will keep pressure on with new versions of its budget K6-2 and K6-3. A discount version of the Athlon will also come out mid-2000. Separately, Intel will be coming out with its first 64-bit chip, Itanium, toward the middle of 2000. The company is currently shipping prototype processors running at between 500 MHz and 600 MHz to computer makers for testing. When released, Itanium will run at much higher speeds, Brookwood said. Though Intel has advanced its chip schedule, the fastest chips will be scarce. For instance, Dell and Gateway both announced 800-MHz systems yesterday. A Dell spokeswoman admitted, however, that it takes about 20 days to prepare and ship an 800-MHz computer, putting delivery into the next year. Computers with slower processors can be at the consumer's door in five days. Part of the acceleration also comes from a fundamental change in Intel's business practices. Until recently, Intel would manufacture thousands of new chips before announcing them so that there were ample supplies of PCs in the sales channel. Now, the company is announcing chips when only limited supplies are available, which allows Intel to release the chips at a faster rate. An Intel spokesman said that this pattern should continue in the future, especially as more PC companies move to the build-to-order manufacturing method. Ironically, AMD has been hurt in the past by an inability to manufacture enough chips to meet the demands of PC makers, noted Microprocessor Report's Gwennap, a track record that Intel executives have been known to mention. AMD may be able to go on the offensive with plans to introduce chips that have faster copper technology and special high-speed "cache" memory built into the chip. "If AMD can accomplish those two things on schedule, they would be in a position to put a little bit of distance between themselves and Intel by late in the second quarter," Brookwood said. "In the past, watching Intel compete with AMD was a really dull tennis match. Intel would serve the ball and AMD would never be able to return it," Brookwood said. "Now, Intel serves, and AMD so far has demonstrated a pretty good ability to return those serves."
2003-01-16 - Intel accelerates Itanium schedule Intel has changed the release schedule of its Itanium chips for servers, adding a new chip for 2004 and moving up the launch date of an Itanium with two processor cores to 2005 from 2007. The changes reflect Intel's confidence in its ability to release high-end server chips faster than competitors and thereby gain the performance high ground, said Jonathan Eunice, principal analyst at Illuminata. Itanium 2 ranks with the best server chips in the market, but the new release schedule will likely enhance the chip's attractiveness and put pressure on competitors to step up their own schedules, something that they have been loath to do. Intel's "design teams and design resources are well stocked, so they can do a shrink early or do a dual-core (chip) early. They have a lot of leeway that would stress out a Sparc development team," Eunice said, referring to shrinking the size of components on a chip and to Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc processor. Under the new schedule, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker this summer will release Madison, a souped-up version of the current Itanium 2 with 6MB of level 3 cache, according to Jason Waxman, marketing manager for enterprise processors at Intel. Increasing the cache, a reservoir of memory located on the processor, generally enhances performance. The chip, which will contain around 500 million transistors, will run at 1.5GHz. Madison, like the entire Itanium family, is a 64-bit chip, meaning that it can digest data in 64-bit chunks (as opposed to 32-bit Pentium chips). Typically, 64-bit chips fit into the most expensive and powerful servers. Soon after, Intel will release Deerfield, an energy-efficient Itanium 2 for rack and blade servers. Then, in 2004, the company will come out with a new version of Madison that will contain 9MB of level 3 cache. Most server chips currently come with 1MB of cache. This chip was previously not on Intel's product road maps, Waxman said. Two cores better than one In 2005, Intel will follow with Montecito, which will contain two Itanium processor cores on the same piece of silicon. Dual-processor chips are pretty much what they sound like: single chips that contain two separate "brains" so they can best a single-core chip but cost less than two separate ones. It's one of the hot design ideas in the chip world. IBM has already come out with the first dual-processor chip for the server market, Power4. Sun's UltraSparc IV, debuting toward the end of the year, is expected to contain two processor cores. Analysts have also noted that Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron chip, coming out in the first half, could be redesigned to accommodate a second processor core. Originally, Montecito, due in 2004, wasn't a dual-core chip, but it was morphed after engineering and manufacturing teams concurred that a dual-processor chip could be mass-manufactured at Intel by 2005. "Our dual-core (chip) was originally planned for the following generation of chips," said Waxman. Besides enhancing performance, Intel may use its dual-core chips to undercut IBM, said Kevin Krewell, senior editor at the Microprocessor Report. In larger servers, Oracle and other software vendors charge a licensing fee for every processor in a given server. To date, IBM has said that the Power4, although a single chip, has two processors. Hence, software customers have to buy two licenses for each Power4 chip. Intel is already indicating that it will consider Montecito a single processor, requiring only one software license, Krewell said. "I think they are going to sell it that way to make it cost effective" to switch to Itanium from other servers with different chips, Krewell said. Montecito, Krewell added, will be made on the 90-nanometer process, which means the average feature inside the chip measures 90 nanometers. Madison, Madison II and Deerfield will contain features measuring 130 nanometers. The current Itanium 2 comes with 180-nanometer features. Reducing feature size allows companies to squeeze more transistors on a chip. Not as sweet by any other name Continuity is another theme. Madison, Deerfield and Madison II will be sold under the Itanium 2 name. All of the forthcoming chips, including Montecito, will also fit into the same motherboard sockets and be capable of using the same chipsets currently used in Itanium 2 servers, said Waxman. In turn, this will reduce the need for server makers to redesign their servers with each new chip release, smoothing the commercial adoption. Despite its long and often controversial history, the Itanium family appears to be gaining momentum in the market, according to Eunice. In the mid-1990s, analysts speculated that the chip, designed by Intel and Hewlett-Packard, would become one of the most popular for high-end servers. However, the first version, formerly code-named Merced, was delayed several times and offered only middling performance. It finally debuted in 2001; sales were dismal. Itanium 2, formerly McKinley, came out in July 2002 and was substantially different from the first Itanium. Analysts have given it fairly positive reviews. Itanium 2 "competes or outperforms the fastest Alpha and Power chips. It is right up there at the elite country club of performance," Eunice said. Still, despite strong benchmark scores, sales started slow. The economy was in a slump, which discouraged interest from customers, software developers and hardware makers. Interest, though, appears to be growing, Eunice said. Laboratories and other scientific customers are increasingly offering Itanium 2 servers. More software tools are also coming onto the market. If the tide changes, Intel could benefit. "2002 was a terrible time to launch a new technology," said Eunice.
2005-03-01 - Intel 15 dual-core projects under way  SAN FRANCISCO--They're going dual-core crazy at Intel. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is working on 15 different multicore chips at the moment for the server, notebook, desktop and networking market, said Steve Smith, vice president of the Digital Enterprise Group, during a talk at the Intel Developer Forum here. Dual-core chips for the desktop market, code-named Smithfield, will appear in the second quarter, about the same time as a dual-core Itanium chip, code-named Montecito, arrives. Smithfield, which will be marketed as an Extreme Edition Pentium 4 chip for gamers, will run at 3.2GHz, slower than single-core chips on the market today, and have an 800MHz bus. Each core has a 1MB cache, less than existing chips. Although Smithfield will be slower and have less cache, its two cores will boost performance, Smith said. Smithfield, which can run 64-bit software, will also fit into the same package as current Pentium 4 Extreme Edition chips, so it can be used in current PC designs, he said. "To get this kind of performance a year ago, you would have had to buy a dual-core workstation," said Smith. Over the year, the dual-core concept will come to nearly all of Intel's product lines. In 2006, 85 percent of its server chips offered will be dual-core, the company said, while more than 70 percent of its desktop and notebook chips will have multiple cores. Multiple cores, multiple threads Though the first chips will have two cores, future chips will have four or more cores, Smith said. On many chips, particularly in the server market, each core will be able to process multiple threads at once, and thereby further increase performance. Threading and multiple cores will also help gamers, Smith said. Typically, adding threads and cores lets a computer do more things at once and/or run individual applications much faster. By the end of the decade, Intel will produce cores with up to eight threads, meaning that a four-core chip could run 32 simultaneous tasks. Sun Microsystems and IBM are working on similar projects. Intel will continue to make single-core chips, Smith said. The move to dual-core and multicore chips also means an explosion of code names. In the Itanium line, a chip called Montvale will arrive in 2006. It will be followed later by Tukwila, which will be the first processor from Intel to have more than two cores. Montvale will be made on 90-nanometer processes, while Tukwila will be made on 65-nanometer processes. (The nanometer measurement refers to the average size of features on a chip.) Montvale and Tukwila will be for more-expensive Itanium systems. Less-expensive dual-core Itanium chips include a Millington, DP Montvale and Dimona. Turning on the Xeons In the Xeon line, the first dual-core chip, called Paxville, will arrive in 2006 and be made on the 90-nanometer process. Tulsa, a 65-nanometer dual-core Xeon, will arrive later that same year. Before the release of Paxville, Intel plans to deliver a single-core Xeon with a whopping 8MB of cache, Smith said. This will compete against a dual-core Opteron coming from Advanced Micro Devices in the middle of this year. Tulsa will be followed by Whitefield, which will be able to fit into the same servers as an Itanium chip. Intel has said it will develop common chipsets, motherboards and other parts so that Xeon and Itanium chips will be interchangeable in servers by 2007. In desktops, Smithfield will be followed by Presler in 2006, an Extreme Edition Chip for high-end desktops, made on the 65-nanometer process. For the standard desktop market, Intel will come out with a dual-core chip called Cedar Mill in 2006. Typically, Extreme Edition chips have larger caches and/or faster system buses. Smith said Presler will have threaded cores and Cedar Mill will have standard cores, giving Presler a performance advantage. Another chip, Yonah, will come out for notebooks in late 2005 to early 2006. It will be teamed with a wireless chip called Golan. Smithfield chips will be sold with other Intel chips in an overall platform, or reference design. For businesses, the Smithfield platform is code-named Anchor Creek, while the home version of this platform is called Lyndon. Anchor Creek and Lyndon will sport, among other features, up to 8GB of memory, eight USB 2.0 ports and an ability to add four hard drives. Yonah and Golan will show up in the Napa platform. Smith said there are three basic dual-core architectures. Some dual-core chips will consist of a single piece of silicon. Though the two cores will access the outside world through a single bus, they will largely be independent. This is how Smithfield will work. The two cores function independently and then shuttle data through the same bus. The cores on Montecito, meanwhile, will be more integrated. Some other dual-core chips will consist of two separate pieces of silicon in a single package. This approach is intended to cut design and manufacturing costs.
2008-09-17 - InfiniBand eight years later   In October of 2000, I hopped a Las Vegas-bound flight to attend a developers' event being thrown by the InfiniBand Trade Association. By way of background, InfiniBand was one of the hot technology properties of the pre-bubble-bursting days. It was touted as a better (faster, more efficient) way to connect servers than the ubiquitous Ethernet. Its more vocal backers, of which there were many, went so far as to position it as a "System Area Network"--a connective fabric for data centers. A whole mini-industry of silicon, software, host bus adapter, and switch vendors supported InfiniBand. One sizable cluster resided in Austin, Texas, but there were many of them scattered around the U.S. and elsewhere--to say nothing of significant InfiniBand initiatives at companies such as IBM and Intel. I don't remember all the details of that past InfiniBand event but it filled a decent-sized hall at the Mandalay Bay and was followed by a party that took over the hotel's "beach" on a balmy Vegas evening. Last week, I attended another InfiniBand event, Techforum '08. It was also in Las Vegas. More modest digs at Harrah's reflected that InfiniBand hasn't exactly lived up to those past hopes. However, the fact that there even was a TechForum '08 also reflects that InfiniBand is still with us--primarily as a server connect for high performance computing (HPC) applications where low latency and high bandwidth are especially important. Given that I've been following InfiniBand since its early days, this seems like a good opportunity to reflect on where InfiniBand stands today and where it may be going. As with another Big "I" technology, Intel's Itanium processor, it's tempting to glibly dismiss InfiniBand as a failure because it failed to live up to early (probably unrealistic) hopes and promises. In fact, InfiniBand now dominates performance sensitive connections between servers in HPC. It's largely taken the place of a plethora of competing alternatives, most notably Myricom's Myrinet and Quadrics' QsNet. Plain old Gigabit Ethernet has successfully held onto its position of default data center interconnect and FibreChannel has remained the default for storage area networks. But InfiniBand has actually been quite successful at establishing itself as the standard interconnect for optimized clusters. One also finds InfiniBand technology beneath the covers in a variety of products. Among other products, a variety of blade chassis use InfiniBand in their backplanes. This may not exactly be InfiniBand the standard, but it is InfiniBand the technology. And this type of use contributes to InfiniBand component volumes--which tends to drive down prices. But, what of 10 Gigabit Ethernet? Isn't it inevitable that 10 GbE will replace InfiniBand? Indeed, most InfiniBand component suppliers, such as Mellanox, are covering their bets by embracing both technologies. But 10 GbE, after many years in development, remains in early days. Costs are still high. The converged 10 GbE that is most relevant to InfiniBand's future sometimes called "Data Center Ethernet" isn't even a single thing. It's at least six different standards initiatives from the IEEE and IETF (not including the related FibreChannel over Ethernet efforts). In many cases, 10 GbE will also require that data centers upgrade their cable plant to optical fiber. In short, although 10 GbE will certainly emerge as an important component of data center infrastructures, lots of technical work (and political battles) remain. So does Ethernet conquer all? Maybe. Someday. A lot happens someday. InfiniBand may not ever markedly expand on the sorts of roles that it plays. But 10 GbE is far from ready to take over when latency has to be lowest and bandwidth has to be highest.
2012-08-01 - In Itanium legal tiff HP wins over Oracle  Oracle just can't catch a break in any of its courtroom battles lately. Hewlett-Packard has just won a major court ruling in the Itanium case against the hardware giant. Here are the key points in the ruling handed down by the Superior Court of California this afternoon: The Settlement and Release Agreement entered into by HP and Oracle in September 2010 required Oracle to continue to offer its product suite on HPs Itanium-based server platforms and didn't permit Oracle to decide on its own whether to do so or not. That agreement also pertains to any Oracle software products that were offered on HPs Itanium-based servers at the time the deal was signed. Thus, Oracle was required to continue to offer its products on HPs Itanium-based server platforms until HP discontinued sales of Itanium-based servers. Oracle was required to port its products to HPs Itanium-based servers without charge to HP. For reference, HP filed a civil lawsuit against Oracle in June 2011 to support the Itanium platform after Oracle said the previous March that it would stop supporting HP's Itanium platform because Intel planned to shut it down in the long run. HP and Intel both had denied Oracle's claims. HP has already issued the following statement: Todays proposed ruling is a tremendous win for HP and its customers. The Superior Court of the State of California, Santa Clara County, has confirmed the existence of a contract between HP and Oracle that requires Oracle to port its software products to HPs Itanium-based servers. We expect Oracle to comply with its contractual obligation as ordered by the Court. Oracle has also responded with a statement of its own: Last March, Oracle made an engineering decision to stop future software development on the Itanium chip. We made the decision as we became convinced that Itanium was approaching its end of life and we explained our rationale to customers here: www.oracle.com/itanium. Nothing in the Court's preliminary opinion changes that fact. We know that Oracle did not give up its fundamental right to make platform engineering decisions in the 27 words HP cites from the settlement of an unrelated employment agreement. HPs argument turns the concept of Silicon Valley partnerships upside down. We plan to appeal the Court's ruling while fully litigating our cross claims that HP misled both its partners and customers. Check out the full decision from Judge James P. Kleinberg: HP v. Oracle: Proposed Statement of Decision This story originally appeared at ZDNet's Between the Lines under the headline "HP wins over Oracle in Itanium legal battle."

2004-01-13 - IDC rains on Itanium parade    IDC, an influential market research firm, has lowered its projections for sales of servers that use Intel's Itanium processor because of competition with chips from Advanced Micro Devices and others. IDC expects Itanium server shipments to reach $7.5 billion in 2007, a drop from its previous forecast of $8.7 billion, the firm said Tuesday, but for the short term, it actually raised projections. The newest lowering of projections is dour news for the processor, which many once assumed would sweep the server world the same way Intel's "x86" processors have swept the desktop computer market. Over the years, IDC has lowered its Itanium forecasts several times. In 2000, it expected 2004 Itanium server sales to reach $28 billion. The reason for the changed forecast: "As the Itanium architecture becomes established, it will be challenged by what we consider more incumbent architectures that are here today and (by AMD's) emerging x86-64," Vernon Turner, vice president of IDC server group research, said in a conference call Tuesday. The x86-64 chip technology, now called AMD64, is the method by which Intel rival AMD is adding 64-bit features to processor designs. AMD64 adds 64-bit features, such as the ability to address large memory, while still being able to easily run software written for x86 processors such as Intel's Xeon and Pentium or AMD's Athlon. Itanium, by contrast, runs that software only slowly and awkwardly. Intel has a rosier view of Itanium. "We're pleased, overall, with the progress Itanium is making," Intel spokesman Scott McLaughlin said. "We shipped over 100,000 units in 2003. We are making strong progression against RISC" (reduced instruction set of computing) processors, such as IBM's Power and Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc. IDC lowered its forecasts, but it hasn't relegated Itanium to a mere niche. An $8 billion market is twice the size of IBM's mainframe market, Turner said. Itanium, a design begun at Hewlett-Packard and called Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing, had been expected in 1999 but was delayed several times. HP only late in 2003 began offering a full server line using the processor. Despite its troubles, Intel has succeeded in winning a place for Itanium in several servers. HP is the loudest of the chip's backers, but others selling it include Silicon Graphics Inc., Unisys, Dell, IBM, NEC, Hitachi and Fujitsu. Itanium servers will chiefly be higher-end systems with four or eight processors, not dual-processor machines that ship in larger quantities, IDC also forecast. IDC's projections typically predict spending behavior five years in the future. The research firm's 2000 forecast pegged Itanium server sales at $28 billion by 2004. In 2001, IDC predicted sales of $15 billion by 2005 and lowered its forecast later that year to about $12.5 billion. Things got worse in 2002, when the 2006 projections dropped to $9 billion and later in the year were lowered to about $7.5 billion. IBM is one of Itanium's biggest naysayers. Although it ships servers using the processor, it also touts its own 64-bit Power processor family and the pSeries and iSeries server lines that use it. "The case for Itanium weakens daily," Karl Freund, IBM's vice president of management and strategy for pSeries, said in an October presentation.
2006-10-10 - IBM's Power6 gets help with math multimedia    SAN JOSE, Calif.--IBM's forthcoming Power6 processor can count to 10. That may not sound like anything special for a processor whose clock ticks at a rate approaching 5 billion times each second. But Power6 can count to 10--and perform numerous other mathematical operations--with the decimal digits 0 through 9 rather than the binary digits of 0 and 1 used by conventional computers. "When we do multiplication on the chip, we can do it the same way you learned it in grade school," Brad McCredie, Power6's chief architect, said in an interview. McCredie also presented Power6 details at the Fall Processor Forum here Tuesday. Binary math is the ordinary mode for Power6 and a natural for computers: The two digits can conveniently be represented by voltage differences and other yes-or-no, up-or-down, on-or-off differences. But humans, graced with 10 digits, generally opted for base 10, or decimal, mathematics, and about a little more than half of numeric stored in commercial databases is decimal, McCredie said. But precision problems can crop up when computers translate numbers into binary to perform a calculation, then translate back to the decimal system to present answers. For example, 10 percent of $1.50 should be 15 cents, not 14.9999 cents, he said. Consequently, regulations require that some tax and government applications perform math using decimal-based calculations, McCredie said. "There are a lot of software packages so people can run decimal math," he said, but performing the instructions in hardware speeds up processing by a factor of two to seven, he said. It's still slower than binary math, though; the chip can't do as much in a single clock cycle. Power family competition Power6, a dual-core chip IBM will begin manufacturing this year for servers going on sale in mid-2007, is the latest in a series of server processors that are central to Big Blue's recovery in the Unix server market. In terms of revenue, IBM reached the top spot in the market in 2005 over Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems, though the company has given back some of those gains in the first half of 2006. The Power family, which also includes lower-end PowerPC models, competes chiefly with Itanium chips from Intel, Sparc from Sun and Fujitsu, and x86 chips from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. The Power and PowerPC lines will grow one step closer together with Power6, which incorporates the AltiVec instruction set that speeds up many multimedia tasks. AltiVec, also known as VMX, increases efficiency by letting a single processing instruction be applied to multiple data elements. That's helpful for video and audio tasks on desktop machines, but servers will benefit as well in, for example, high-performance computing tasks such as genetic data processing, McCredie said. Adding AltiVec was a tradeoff, he said. It's a valuable feature, but electrical current "leakage" problems in today's chipmaking technology mean that even idle parts of a chip consume power and produce waste heat. Power6 will run at speeds of 4GHz to 5GHz, IBM has said. "It will be closer to 5GHz than it is to 4GHz," McCredie said. To keep up with the faster clock speeds--about twice that of the current 2.3Ghz fastest Power5--IBM increased the Power6's communication abilities. Where Power5 can transfer data on and off the chip at a rate of 150 gigabytes per second, Power6 can do so at 300GBps, McCredie said. IBM also has moved some higher-end reliability features from its mainframe line to Power6, he said. The idea is to catch and fix as many errors as possible before software has to be interrupted. At each cycle, the chip records the state of all the data it's storing; if an error is detected, the chip can revert to its previous state to retry the processing step, McCredie said. If the error is more severe, the entire state of the processor can be moved to a new processor core, an ability called "CPU hot spare." In addition, every data pathway is checked to make sure data isn't corrupted as it moves within the chip, he said. Each Power6 chip has dual processing cores, and each core has 4MB of high-speed level-two cache memory to itself, compared with a 2MB shared cache in Power5. In addition, the two cores can share an optional 32MB of level-three cache separate from the chip, McCredie said. Each core can simultaneously handle two instruction sequences, called "threads." The performance of the second thread is about 55 percent of the first on database transaction tasks, McCredie said, which is about double the performance of the second thread on Power5. To improve virtualization abilities, Power6 can be subdivided into as many as 1,024 separate partitions, each with its own operating system. Customers aren't likely to want slivers that thin, though, he said. "I don't think we're going to deliver that to the customer. I think we're going to stop at 200 or so," McCredie said. A Power6 chip can connect directly to three others in four-socket groupings using a first-tier communication fabric. And each of those groupings can connect directly with seven others over a second-tier communication fabric. The two-tier fabric keeps all the processors' cache memories synchronized.
2009-08-25 - IBM's Power charge continues   IBM's industry analyst meeting last week in Austin, Texas, covered the present and the future of its Power line. This is the system lineup once called the RS/6000 and pSeries into which was more recently folded the iSeries (previously AS/400, System 36, etc.) to form a new family called IBM Power Systems. For our purposes here I am going to focus on Power in the guise of IBM's RISC-based lineup running a combination of AIX (IBM's flavor of commercial Unix) and Linux (either natively or using PowerVM Lx86 to run x86 Linux applications). IBM i, the successor to OS/400, also runs on the unified Power line. IBM is slated to publicly unveil some of the details of Power7 , the next generation in the Power microprocessor lineup, at the Hot Chips conference at Stanford University on Tuesday. At the top-level, IBM describes Power7 as having eight cores per chip, four threads per core using simultaneous multithreading (SMT), and two to three times the per-chip performance of Power6 using the same amount of power. Specifics of the systems based on Power7 will come later. IBM did say it'll build Power7 systems that generally add the required memory, bandwidth, networking, and so forth to keep the systems balanced. Beyond future hardware, though, there were a few themes from this meeting worth highlighting. IBM's Unix business is a smooth running machine at this point. We repeatedly saw a chart detailing IBM Unix Server revenue share gains at the expense of HP and Sun. The three companies held roughly equal share at the start of 2005; today IBM holds about 37 percent of the total market, about 10 percent more than those competitors. One can always argue about which particular slicing and dicing of data most accurately represents the state of the market--of course, each vendor chooses the view that paints it in the best light--but it's hard to argue against the idea that IBM Power is on a nice upward trajectory. Part of this is IBM's processor road map. One of the corollaries of Moore's Law is that time to market is performance. What would be a truly compelling processor in Year X is much less so in Year X+1 and even less so in Year X+2. And IBM Power development has been on a solid three-year cadence for major releases combined with interim speed bumps. Competitively, Sun's "Rock" has been reportedly canceled and Intel's next major iteration of Itanium, "Tukwila," has been much delayed. However, it's also a case that IBM has simply made advancing Power Systems a real priority and has systematically put the resources in place to make that happen. I'm inclined to argue that this focus on scale-up, mission-critical, and integrated stacks that have helped lead to Power's success and the mainframe's renaissance have worked against IBM is the less differentiated segments of the x86 business. (IBM does bring many of the same concepts and even technologies to x86 with its higher-end eXA products.) Be that as it may, when it comes to Power Systems, IBM's understanding of the needs of large enterprise data centers for their core applications has paid off. Some of this may seem unremarkable. It is IBM we're talking about here after all. However, the idea of a Unix server as an integrated stack or solution is actually a relatively new one in historical terms. Before x86 servers became so ubiquitous it was the Unix server that epitomized the roll-your-own style of computing. And Sun, until quite latterly, painted lack of any forced software (much less services) integration as a virtue. Thus, while Power Systems are certainly still widely used in high-performance computing where the ethos still tends toward more home-grown customization and integration, Power Systems have generally evolved from a traditional Unix server mindset to one more familiar to mainframe buyers and operators. This isn't to say that Power Systems slavishly imitates all the approaches that its System z mainframe brethren take. After all, if a buyer wants a mainframe, IBM already makes one; no need to re-create a second version. But concepts such as the benefits of owning many levels of the hardware and software stack are twined throughout Power Systems presentations--and this is very much a mainframe characteristic. Perhaps this shines through most closely with virtualization, which is a central theme to Power Systems discussion. Power servers are virtualized. That doesn't mean that they have an embedded hypervisor that can be booted up or that they're factory-loaded with virtualization in some way. Rather, even if you choose to run just one copy of an operating system, you're running it virtualized. IBM's 6 million transactions per minute on the TPC-C benchmark was on a virtualized system. Virtualization is inherent in the processor and firmware in addition to the IBM management software that sits on top. Power Systems users make use of virtualization. As measured by the sales of PowerVM--IBM's suite to deploy, manage, and utilize multiple VMs on a server--about 66 percent of Power customers use or at least plan to use the features of virtualization at some level. (PowerVM comes in several editions; more money gets you more features.) Contrast this with x86 where, for all the legitimate interest in and excitement about virtualization, the penetration with new servers is still something in the 15 percent or so range. The largest Power servers are huge. With rare exceptions and bragging-rights benchmarks notwithstanding, big servers these days aren't about running one workload or even about running one operating instance. It's about running many, many workloads with the appropriate combination of workload management techniques to enforce separation, provide flexibility, and offer mechanisms to guard against failures of various kinds. Virtualization (in several forms) is the foundation for all of this. It wasn't that long ago, even by the standards of the computer industry, the IBM's RISC/Unix lineup was in danger of becoming a sideline. IBM dabbled in Unix "unification" efforts and with Intel's Itanium processor, and invested heavily in work associated with scaling up Linux. These efforts often seemed aimed at marginalizing its own RISC/Unix processor and operating system development work over the long term. However, in 2001, IBM released Power4. It was a major step forward in processor performance, and had two CPUs per processor die--then an unusual feature. Around the same time, IBM also doubled down on the development of its AIX flavor of Unix. The result of those decisions, combined with consistent execution, is a very good one for IBM.
2006-04-18 - IBM's Oracle rebate counters HP Sun    After Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems announced significant deals with Oracle in recent months, IBM is striking back with rebates of as much as $300,000 for software from the database giant. HP Chief Executive Mark Hurd announced broader software support and favorable pricing from Oracle in March--and got Oracle CEO Larry Ellison to endorse its Itanium servers with the words, "There is no more important platform for Oracle than HP and Itanium." The move came after a January meeting with Ellison and Sun CEO Scott McNealy, who announced an alliance to resell Oracle software with major discounts for customers. HP and Sun both singled out IBM, which sells database and commerce software that competes with Oracle products, as a target for their programs. On Tuesday, IBM told customers about its own promotion for those switching from competitors' systems to Big Blue's Power processor-based pSeries servers. Rebates for Oracle software include $1,000 for a p5-520 with two 1.9GHz processor cores; $25,000 for a p5-570 with 16 2.2GHz cores; $160,000 for a p5-595 with 16 1.6GHz cores; and $300,000 for a top-end p5-595 with 64 1.9GHz cores. IBM said the program began Tuesday and listed no end date.
2000-06-12 - IBM ups Linux support with laptops IBM today jumped behind Linux in a big way. Big Blue is increasing its commitment to the Unix variant in high-end systems, laptops and desktop PCs. Among the changes: the availability of SuSE Linux on select RS/6000 servers and Caldera OpenLinux on A20 and T20 ThinkPads; WebSphere support for Linux; the introduction of a software bundle for small businesses relying on Linux; and funding for Linux education and certification. Today's announcement ups the ante for big-iron server companies backing Linux, with IBM substantially widening its support in both Linux servers and services. The move also pits IBM against Compaq Computer, which has an early market lead selling the Unix variant. Gartner analyst George Weiss said IBM's Gartner analyst George Weiss says IBM's Linux push will help increase the credibility of Linux in the enterprise sector. see commentary  increased emphasis on Linux is obviously good for the company and could bring more corporate attention to the Unix variant. But Weiss warned that Linux has yet to prove itself "in large enterprise deployments" and added that fledging "software developer enthusiasm, service and support on a global basis, disaster recovery, and other service-level guarantees" are significant weaknesses that must be overcome before the operating system makes additional headway in corporate installations. Initially, SuSE Linux will be available on just a few RS/6000 models, with wider support planned for later in the year. The B50 rack-mountable server, which IBM targets at service providers; F-50 deckside server; and 43P model 150 entry servers and workstations are among the first RS/6000s supporting Linux. IBM said it would later offer Linux on its AS/400 systems but would not give specific information on availability. Big Blue already offers Linux on Netfinity servers and has been testing it on the S/390. "You will absolutely see Linux available on our entire server line," said Buell Duncan, general manager of IBM's global business partners group. The stumbling block is "the ability for the applications to port and migrate across our server family." Besides the server news, IBM announced that WebSphere version 3.02 now supports Linux applications. WebSphere, IBM?s main business-to-business e-commerce software package, could benefit from supporting Linux applications, many of which are geared toward the Internet and are available free. Big Blue also introduced Small Business Pack for Linux, with DB2 Universal Database 7.1, WebSphere 3.02 and Lotus Domino Application Server 5.03, for a promotional price of $499. According to International Data Corp., 48 percent of Linux installations go into small businesses with 100 employees or less. To bolster Linux services and support, Big Blue today committed several million dollars to support and training programs for 45,000 software developers and 45,000 IBM dealers. Duncan said that in the past year, IBM has invested $10 million in e-business training. Unlike competing commercial operating systems, such as Microsoft?s Windows 2000 or Solaris from Sun Microsystems, Linux is an open-source effort, with many programmers continually contributing to its development. Programmer Linus Torvalds first developed the Unix derivative in 1991. In the past few years, several software companies, such as Red Hat and VA Linux, have hit it big offering commercial versions of Linux and associated services. But not all is well in the Linux community. Canadian software maker Corel, which has all but bet the company?s future on Linux, last week laid off 320 employees as part of restructuring. Corel seeks to trim $40 million in annual spending. Linux?s biggest success has been on servers, where Compaq commands the lion's share of the market. In the fourth quarter, the Houston-based PC maker had 25 percent Linux server market share, compared with 10 percent for IBM and 7 percent each for Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer, according to IDC. IBM's bolstering of not just server but software and services support for Linux could be the boost it needs to widen its lead over Dell and HP and close the gap with Compaq. The Linux battle rages on other fronts. While Microsoft fights with the government over the future of Windows, some of its biggest competitors are positioning Linux for the future, with HP, Red Hat, SGI and Sun working on projects to bring Linux to Intel?s Itanium processor. By contrast, Microsoft?s efforts to quickly bring a 64-bit version of Windows 2000 to market may lag behind Linux. Linux is slowly gaining ground on the desktop, with Dell and others offering the operating system on some commercial PCs. But Linux availability on portables has lagged, mainly because of driver deficiencies and other compatibility problems. Big Blue last year broke ground on certifying Linux for portables--Red Hat 6.0 on the ThinkPad 600E--but fell short of offering it preinstalled. Today?s commitment goes much further, with Linux available directly from IBM and on its newest ThinkPad models. IBM is not the only major computer manufacturer offering Linux on portables. Dell in February started offering Red Hat Linux 6.1 preinstalled on Latitude CPx and Inspiron 7500 notebooks. IBM today committed to preloading Caldera OpenLinux eDesktop 2.4 on the ThinkPad A20m and T20 models. In the third quarter, IBM promised to certify select ThinkPad models for Red Hat, SuSE and TurboLinux versions of Linux.
2003-06-24 - IBM unveils Opteron server SOMERS, N.Y.--IBM on Tuesday gave supercomputing aficionados a glimpse of an Opteron chip-based system that is geared for high-performance tasks. As earlier reported, the system, unveiled at the ClusterWorld conference in San Jose, Calif., is a dual-processor, rack-mounted server measuring 1.75 inches thick. It is expected to ship in the second half of 2003. The machine, which IBM first discussed in April, is designed to be clustered in large numbers to form a single, powerful computational engine. Clustered systems are increasingly popular with customers that have intense computing requirements, such as pharmaceutical designers, automakers and banks. Intel's Xeon processor is widely used for these systems, but rival Advanced Micro Devices is working to find a place for its new Opteron chip as well. "For those segments that have already embraced AMD, the enthusiasm for Opteron is very, very high," said Dave Turek, leader of IBM's new "Deep Computing" team, pointing to government laboratories in particular. "We have substantial pull from customers." AMD's Opteron processor runs the same software as do Intel's Xeon and Pentium products, but it also has 64-bit extensions that allow it to speed some types of calculations and to accommodate more memory. To take advantage of those extensions, software must be rebuilt for the chip--an Opteron version of Linux from SuSE is available, for example. One difference between IBM's high-performance computing business and that of its competitors is its program to rent out its own supercomputing centers. This program enables customers to tap into the centers when they have more number-crunching to do than their in-house machines can handle. The first customer for the rental service is Petroleum Geo-Services. On Tuesday, IBM announced another customer: GX Technology of Houston. Turek said IBM's Opteron systems will arrive in early fall. They'll cost somewhat more than Intel Xeon systems but much less than Itanium systems, he said. In addition, IBM will release Opteron versions of some of its software for high-performance computing, including its Global Parallel File System and its systems management product, Turek said. IBM expects interest in the Opteron systems from customers in government agencies and universities, as well as in the life sciences, petroleum and automotive design industries, Turek said. To accommodate some of the demand, IBM this year will put some Opteron servers in its supercomputing center in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., which customers will be able to tap into as needed instead of buying systems on their own. Big Blue's supercomputing work has led the company to trail niche leader Hewlett-Packard by a single system on the "Top500" list of the world's 500 fastest machines. To accelerate its work, the Armonk, N.Y.-based company formed an expanded supercomputing team--named Deep Computing--in April and last week hired longtime IDC supercomputing analyst Debra Goldfarb to be vice president of strategy and products. While the Top500 list highlights cutting-edge supercomputing designs, most of the market is for less-exotic systems, Goldfarb said in an interview Thursday. Buyers spent less than $1 billion last year on super-high-end "capability" systems built to accomplish specific goals such as modeling climate change or predicting nuclear weapons' physics, she said. In contrast, about $5.5 billion was spent on more standard systems, typically close relatives of servers sold for ordinary business use. Cluster supercomputers typically use ordinary lower-end servers that run the Linux operating system. However, a Dell Computer cluster at the Cornell Theory Center that runs Microsoft's Windows OS has appeared on the Top500 list. One cluster of Opteron-based machines, code-named Red Storm, is slated to be created by supercomputing specialist Cray for Sandia National Laboratories in the United States. On Monday, SuSE announced that Cray had selected its version of Linux to run on the machine. Under the deal, the German Linux seller will provide developer support as well as its operating system. For its part, chipmaker Intel hopes to use the cluster market to further its comparatively new Itanium family of 64-bit processors, which compete with AMD's Opteron and established 64-bit chip lines from IBM and Sun Microsystems. On Monday, Intel gave details of a new version of its upcoming Itanium 2 6M "Madison" chip. This version will be tailored to dual-processor machines, which are well-suited to clusters. Compared with the mainstream Madison chip--expected to debut on June 30--the dual-processor Madison will have less high-speed cache memory, according to company spokeswoman Barbara Grimes. The new chip brings to four the number of Madison varieties that Intel plans. In addition to IBM, specialists in cluster computing such as RLX Technologies, Topspin Communications and Platform Computing are expected to highlight advances in their own wares at ClusterWorld.
2007-04-24 - IBM Unix servers get x86 Linux apps    IBM has released beta software to let applications written for Linux on servers with x86 processors run in Big Blue's System p machines built with its own Power processors. The software, called System p Application Virtual Environment (AVE) and announced Monday, is based on the QuickTransit software from start-up Transitive, which translates the software instructions for one chip into the language understood by another, storing frequently used instructions to speed execution. The software gets around what's called a "binary break"--the fact that software binary files created for one type of computer processor don't work on another. Although Linux is widely used on x86 servers--those using chips such as Intel's Xeon or Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron--it's a relative rarity on IBM's Power chips, in part because of that binary break. IBM has been striving for years to change this and attract more Linux software. System p machines currently run IBM's version of Unix, named AIX, Linux products from Red Hat and Novell, and IBM's i5/OS--indeed, they can run all those operating systems at the same time in separate partitions using technology called virtualization. The company hopes the AVE software will mean its massive System p machines will be better able to replace scads of inefficiently used x86 servers. AVE is in beta testing now, but IBM plans to release a final, free version in the second half of 2007, the company said. It works on servers with Power5 and Power5+ processors, or on JS20 or JS21 blade servers using PowerPC 970 processors. At this stage, it runs 32-bit Linux software only. The company wouldn't discuss software performance comparing AVE to servers with modern x86 processors, but said the focus of development now is shifting from fleshing out features to improving performance. For computing-intensive tasks, IBM recommends using software written natively for the processor it's running on. IBM offers free support for a year to software companies that plan to use AVE to bring their Linux software to IBM Power servers, the company said. Customers, too, get a free year of support. And while certifications for x86 don't carry over, the bottom line is that "the x86 applications run on System p without modification," spokesman John Buscemi said. Transitive customers also include Apple, which uses it in its Rosetta software to ease customers' transition from PowerPC chips to Intel chips; SGI, which offers the software to customers moving from older machines with MIPS processors to newer Itanium-based models; and Intel, which uses it to attract customers with software for Sun Microsystems' Sparc chips to its Itanium-based models.
2003-06-30 - IBM touts own chips over Itanium   IBM formally debuted its own Itanium-based servers Monday, but made its priorities clear by simultaneously announcing test results that put a machine using its own chip ahead of an Itanium server manufactured by Hewlett-Packard. Reader Resources Itanium 2 in depth CNET White Papers IBM's top-end p690 "Regatta" Unix server, which uses IBM's Power4 processor, bumped aside a Hewlett-Packard machine using Itanium for the top spot on the Transaction Processing Performance Council's widely watched TPC-C test. IBM's score of 768,000 transactions per minute edged ahead of the score of 707,000 that HP posted in May. In addition, IBM's cost per transaction was slightly less expensive than the HP Superdome machine and considerably better than Big Blue's previous result. "The notion that HP's Itanium 2 processor-based servers are less expensive than IBM's widely popular Unix eServer systems is a myth," said Adalio Sanchez, general manager of IBM's pSeries Unix server line, in a statement. The statement came just hours after IBM announced its new x450 Itanium server. Itanium, a 64-bit design with features for data protection, encroaches onto IBM's high-end server turf further than any previous Intel chip. One analyst saw IBM's Unix server announcement as an indication that the company's own products will stay on top of its own product lineup, but also that Big Blue is feeling pressure. "IBM clearly intends to keep its Power processor and pSeries machines positioned as their top-end Unix and Linux servers, with both Itanium and Windows positioned as appropriate for less demanding roles," Illuminata analyst David Freund said. "Of interest to customers, though, is the price pressure that Intel and Microsoft have injected into the 64-bit computing arena." IBM said during a conference call Monday that the timing of the announcements was coincidental. "We finished at around 5 a.m.," said Nick Bowen, head of IBM's AIX version of Unix that runs on its pSeries line and the executive in charge of the benchmark. And HP, which co-developed the Itanium line, said IBM's announcement shows that the competitive landscape has shifted. "This announcement from IBM is a great validation that HP's Integrity servers based on Itanium are the standard to beat in the marketplace, and this truly is a two-horse race for the enterprise market," said Mark Hudson, vice president of HP's Enterprise Storage and Server group, in a statement. IBM countered that HP's Itanium Superdome results have used Windows, which has a much less mature collection of software, and that HP has yet to post a Superdome result with HP-UX and Itanium. In addition, "the Power architecture allows you to perform more work with half the processors," which saves on software licensing costs and increases reliability, IBM's Sanchez said on the conference call. Intel on Monday released its third-generation Itanium chip, code-named "Madison". The high-end processor is designed to compete with IBM's Power line and Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc line, initially in higher-end machines but gradually in less-expensive models as well. The initial Itanium product was hampered by delays and poor performance, but Intel and its allies now are building the collection of software and hardware partners necessary to carry the chip closer to mainstream use.
2004-11-19 - IBM tops server speed test IBM's new top-end Power5-based Unix server has a commanding lead in a performance test of servers running a large database. A $16.7 million configuration of the company's eServer p5-595 performed 3.21 million transactions per minute on the TPC-C test from the Transaction Processing Performance Council, IBM said Wednesday. The server will become widely available Thursday. The score topped two previous records: the fastest cluster, held by Hewlett-Packard Itanium machines running Red Hat Linux at 1.18 million transactions per minute, and the fastest single system, an IBM Power4 server running the AIX operating system at 1.03 million transactions per minute. IBM's system had 32 1.9GHz Power5 processors, each with dual-processing engines called cores; 2 terabytes of memory; IBM's DB2 database software; and 6,548 hard drives in 45 DS4500 storage systems and 490 accompanying DS4000 storage expansion systems. The TPC-C is no longer a good reflection of real-world computing loads--its configurations use absurdly large amounts of storage equipment, for example--but it's still the best server test around, said Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice. One alternative, the sales and distribution test running SAP's business software, is useful, but it explicitly prohibits the inclusion of pricing information, which is a basic part of TPC-C. "It's easy to say TPC-C is meaningless, but what's the alternative? The problem is, if you don't do TPC-C, you're left with nada," Eunice said.
2004-09-09 - IBM to use dual-core Opteron   SAN FRANCISCO--IBM will upgrade its Opteron-based e325 server for high-performance computing with Advanced Micro Devices' dual-core chip in 2005, the company plans to announce Thursday. The new e326 will be available next week with current Opteron chips and with the dual-core versions in mid-2005, said Alex Yost, a director of marketing in IBM's eServer group. Big Blue was the first major server maker to embrace Opteron, announcing its support the day AMD released the strategically important chip in 2003. Opteron processors, like rival Xeon chips from Intel that are just emerging now, have added 64-bit features that make it easier to use large amounts of memory. However, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems have overtaken IBM in Opteron enthusiasm this year, positioning their Opteron computers for mainstream use, not just for the high-performance computing niche. Yost argued that there isn't yet enough demand for general-purpose Opteron servers. Customers want the systems for technical applications such as financial modeling and electronics design, but the memory speed and 64-bit advantages of Opteron don't make a difference for most general-purpose applications, he said. Dual-core chips are all the rage, particularly for servers, whose software is more likely written to take advantage of the parallelism. AMD demonstrated its dual-core Opteron last week. And at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco this week, Intel demonstrated a Silicon Graphics server with four dual-core "Montecito" chips, a future version of Itanium, and a dual-core desktop processor. The e326 has a starting price of $2,189, but most customers will buy more powerful configurations costing more than $4,000, Yost said. The systems can accommodate as much as 16GB of memory, have two 100MHz PCI slots and use faster memory than the e325, Yost said. They're rack-mounted computers 1.75 inches thick. IBM assembles servers into a high-performance computing cluster called the eServer 1350 for customers who don't want to do it themselves. A version of the e1350 based on the e326 will be available in November, Yost added. HP and Sun sell two-processor and four-processor Opteron servers at the moment. Sun has eight-processor models under development, said John Fowler, the executive vice president of Sun's Network Systems Group, in a recent interview.
2004-08-17 - IBM to round out iSeries Power5 server family  IBM on Tuesday will fill in the ranks of its iSeries line of Power5 servers with a machine it says can juggle multiple jobs. Big Blue will debut its eServer i5 550, an iSeries machine it created to serve midsize businesses and to bridge the gap between its Power5 eServer i5 520, which has two processors, and its i5 570 model, which offers 16 processors. Those two machines, which also include the Power5--IBM's latest high-end server processor that packs two processor cores into one chip--came out in May. The eServer i5 550 was designed to help midsize businesses, typically companies that employ a few hundred to as many as 1,000 workers, by running their critical computer systems for jobs such as order entry, inventory tracking or e-mail. IBM says that its most basic i5 550 server configuration, which costs about $74,000, comes with two of its four processors "turned on" and includes a license for IBM's i5 operating system. It also includes software that allows the server to run multiple IBM operating systems, such as its AIX, and also to manage additional servers that use Intel hardware and run Linux or Windows operating systems. The first i5 550 servers will ship next month. By including four processors but only turning the first two on initially, IBM is letting customers pay for only what they need up-front and giving them the option of boosting performance in the future. The process of "turning on" the third and fourth processors basically helps companies plan ahead, said Craig Johnson, IBM's iSeries server marketing manager, though IBM also requires a fee of about $3,700 to turn each extra processor on, and companies are required to license extra copies of their desired operating systems per processor as well. Despite its ability to tackle running a company's e-mail or order-entry system, the i5 550's $74,000 initial price tag might seem steep to some. IBM counters by saying that the machine can be purchased in various bundles, some of which cost less than $74,000. Meanwhile, the 550 can also run multiple operating systems simultaneously, allowing it to do the job of many other servers as well. IBM aids in that task by including, at no extra cost, applications such as its IBM Director Multiplatform, which is designed to help out company IT staff by allowing the i5 550 to manage Intel servers running Linux or Windows. Freeing up IT staff members means they can work on other projects, Johnson said. "Typically the hardware is the smallest component of the cost of a system," he said. Thus IBM aims to help customers by "attacking the big pieces of their (IT) expense, which is software plus people. It's about getting those people to do stuff besides babysitting a server farm." Meanwhile, Big Blue will offer package deals, such as the i5 550 Domino Edition, designed for consolidating a Domino e-mail system onto an i5 550. The Domino Edition will cost $56,000 and come with two processors turned on. IBM will also sell a number of Solution Edition i5 550s, starting at $206,000, which include the i5 550 itself, along with IBM services and software applications for jobs like enterprise resource planning. Thus, given the i5 550 server's ability to perform multiple tasks at the same time and also manage other servers, it could replace the need for large numbers of less-expensive servers, Johnson said. Although IBM's Power5 servers are considered stout performers by analysts, IBM's closest competitors, including Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard, aren't ready to cede the high-end server market to Big Blue. Sun is hoping to win more takers with machines based on its UltraSparc IV processor and its Solaris operating system. Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard continues to offer a range of servers based on its own PA-RISC and Alpha chips as well as on Intel's Itanium server chip.
2003-06-23 - IBM to reveal Opteron server   SOMERS, N.Y.--IBM on Tuesday will give supercomputing aficionados a glimpse of an Opteron chip-based system that is geared for high-performance tasks. The system, to be unveiled at the ClusterWorld conference in San Jose, Calif., is a dual-processor, rack-mounted server measuring 1.75 inches thick, an IBM representative said. It is expected to ship in the second half of 2003. The machine, which IBM first discussed in April, is designed to be clustered in large numbers to form a single, powerful computational engine. Clustered systems are increasingly popular with customers that have intense computing requirements, such as pharmaceutical designers, automakers and banks. Intel's Xeon processor is widely used for these systems, but rival Advanced Micro Devices is working to find a place for its new Opteron chip as well. "For those segments that have already embraced AMD, the enthusiasm for Opteron is very, very high," said Dave Turek, leader of IBM's new "Deep Computing" team, pointing to government laboratories in particular. "We have substantial pull from customers." AMD's Opteron processor runs the same software as do Intel's Xeon and Pentium products, but it also has 64-bit extensions that allow it to speed some types of calculations and to accommodate more memory. To take advantage of those extensions, software must be rebuilt for the chip--an Opteron version of Linux from SuSE is available, for example. One difference between IBM's high-performance computing business and that of its competitors is its program to rent out its own supercomputing centers. This program enables customers to tap into the centers when they have more number-crunching to do than their in-house machines can handle. The first customer for the rental service is Petroleum Geo-Services. On Tuesday, IBM is expected to announce another customer: GX Technology of Houston. Big Blue's supercomputing work has led the company to trail niche leader Hewlett-Packard by a single system on the "Top500" list of the world's 500 fastest machines. To accelerate its work, the Armonk, N.Y.-based company formed an expanded supercomputing team--named Deep Computing--in April and last week hired longtime IDC supercomputing analyst Debra Goldfarb to be vice president of strategy and products. While the Top500 list highlights cutting-edge supercomputing designs, most of the market is for less-exotic systems, Goldfarb said in an interview Thursday. Buyers spent less than $1 billion last year on super-high-end "capability" systems built to accomplish specific goals such as modeling climate change or predicting nuclear weapons' physics, she said. In contrast, about $5.5 billion was spent on more standard systems, typically close relatives of servers sold for ordinary business use. Cluster supercomputers typically use ordinary lower-end servers that run the Linux operating system. However, a Dell Computer cluster at the Cornell Theory Center that runs Microsoft's Windows OS has appeared on the Top500 list. One cluster of Opteron-based machines, code-named Red Storm, is slated to be created by supercomputing specialist Cray for Sandia National Laboratories in the United States. On Monday, SuSE announced that Cray had selected its version of Linux to run on the machine. Under the deal, the German Linux seller will provide developer support as well as its operating system. For its part, chipmaker Intel hopes to use the cluster market to further its comparatively new Itanium family of 64-bit processors, which compete with AMD's Opteron and established 64-bit chip lines from IBM and Sun Microsystems. On Monday, Intel gave details of a new version of its upcoming Itanium 2 6M "Madison" chip. This version will be tailored to dual-processor machines, which are well-suited to clusters. Compared with the mainstream Madison chip--expected to debut on June 30--the dual-processor Madison will have less high-speed cache memory, according to company spokeswoman Barbara Grimes. The new chip brings to four the number of Madison varieties that Intel plans. In addition to IBM, specialists in cluster computing such as RLX Technologies, Topspin Communications and Platform Computing are expected to highlight advances in their own wares at ClusterWorld.
2002-03-13 - IBM to release high-end Intel server   IBM on Wednesday will release its highest-end Intel server yet, a system code-named Vigil that uses eight, 12 or 16 processors. The server, now officially called the x440, ties Intel's new Xeon processors together with an IBM-designed chipset--a group of chips that manage a number of a server's internal operations, touting capabilities typically only found in mainframes. Until now, IBM's Intel servers have relied chiefly on chipsets from outside companies such as Intel and Broadcom subsidiary ServerWorks. "We've been working on this for three years," said Jim Gargan, vice president and business line executive for IBM's xSeries Intel servers. The company is aiming not only at Unix server companies such as Sun Microsystems, but also at Unisys, whose ES7000 can accommodate as many as 32 CPUs (central processing units). IBM announced the system at the CeBit trade show in Hannover, Germany. The IBM chipset, called Enterprise X Architecture (EXA) and code-named Summit, creates high-speed communication links between processors, which are grouped into blocks of four. Four-processor blocks can be plugged together with cables to form larger eight or 16 processor systems, and a technology called remote input-output improves how many devices such as network cards can be installed. Although Intel only announced the Xeon chip Tuesday, IBM has already shipped hundreds of four-processor Summit systems, said IBM spokesman Mike Fay. The eight-processor version will go on sale in April, while the 16-processor version is expected in June, Fay said. A 16-processor x440 with 16GB of memory will cost a little more than $100,000, which IBM says is 78 percent less than a comparably configured Unisys ES7000. A low-end version of the x440 with just two processors costs $18,500. Gartner analyst John Enck says the x440 provides the opportunity for high-end computing, but does not force the issue. see commentary "What Unisys is trying to do is sell Intel-based technology at mainframe prices. We're doing just the opposite," Fay said. Unisys counters that it's got a track record with its ES7000, which has been on the market with other Intel processors since 2000. And an ES7000 can continue running even when a processor fails, a feature IBM can't match, Unisys said. IBM has been ready to go with the systems for months. "Clearly, we wish that we had access to more of the" Xeon CPUs, Gargan said. "We could have met more customer demands." When Intel releases "McKinley," the second generation of its high-end Itanium family of chips, IBM will release a Summit server that can accommodate the new CPU, Gargan said. The Summit chipset for McKinley will only be slightly different than the version used inside Vigil, which cuts down development costs.
2002-04-25 - IBM to launch new blade server IBM is betting that when it comes to blade servers, more really is more. The company is set to announce Thursday that it will begin shipping a new high-performance blade server, called eServer BladeCenter, during the third quarter and also introduce storage blades in the future, a move rival EMC is expected to match. Meanwhile, it has discontinued an agreement with RLX Technologies, which kick-started the blade phenomenon in 2001, to resell RLX's servers. The new dual processor-capable eServer blade servers sold under the BladeCenter name will be based on Intel's Xeon processor. Later, IBM will offer blade servers with Intel's Itanium and Big Blue's own PowerPC processors, the company said. Blade servers are essentially small servers built on cards that can be plugged into a special rack, where they are stacked like dishes or like books. The rack offers a shared power supply and networking capabilities and allows customers to add servers on an as-needed basis. Because they consume less energy and take up far less real estate, blades can drastically reduce computing costs. With blades, hundreds of servers can be crammed into a space that previously allowed room for only 84 servers. And far fewer fans are needed to dissipate the reduced heat generated by the machines. Typically, blade servers are used for jobs such as Web site hosting, but IBM thinks they can do more. The company wants to bring blades into the mainstream of the server market and is focusing on improving the performance, reliability and expandability of its blades. "Customers want blades to be real servers," said Tim Dougherty, director of blade marketing for IBM's eServer Group. "By 'real servers,' I mean full power...high performance. Why sacrifice performance if I don't need to? I don't know of any customers whose applications aren't demanding more performance." IBM is adding software to make it easier to coordinate the activity of blades--a growing problem--by borrowing some technology from its xSeries server. The company will offer a version of its Director software for blade servers. Director, based on IBM's eLiza research program, an effort to create self-repairing servers, will help automate jobs like deploying a blade or updating its software. Director will also include self-healing technology that will let customers set rules that allow BladeCenter to automatically replace a failed unit with an unused backup blade or re-prioritize other blades to take over the dead server's responsibilities. BladeCenter will also include a software-rejuvenation feature that identifies potential problems before they cause disruptions in service, while BladeCenter racks will include a network switch responsible for balancing data traffic between the machines. "We think you can do lots of things beyond that," Dougherty added. With its own blades coming, IBM will no longer resell RLX machines. "Our contract with RLX has expired," Dougherty said. "Our customers have pointed us in a different direction." IBM followed a similar pattern with Network Engines, a smaller server maker that preceded RLX as a pioneer in stacking servers as densely as possible. Network Engines was a leader in dual-processor, pizza box-size servers 1.75 inches thick. IBM jumped a step ahead of competitors Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer when it began selling them under its own name. Big Blue eventually developed its own models, though. Compaq, Dell and HP also offer blade servers, such as the Compaq BL10e, and currently it remains a fairly diverse market. HP is pushing for standardization on some parts of the architecture, but so far most companies are pursuing independent design ideas. For now, there's quite a bit of room in the blade market, allowing vendors to carve out their own niches. But as companies such as HP and Dell introduce more complete blade-server product lines, systems management will become a vital point of differentiation, according to Mark Melenovsky, an analyst with research firm IDC. "Ultimately, that's going to be one of the main differentiators in this market," Melenovsky said. "IBM has a really strong message. It's kind of a total-solutions approach...(It's) a pretty strong position." IDC has said it expects the blade-server market to grow fairly rapidly. About 2 million blade servers will ship in 2005, with revenue of about $2.9 billion, it said in a recent report.
2004-09-10 - IBM to launch Linux-only Power servers In an effort to vault its Power processors into more widespread use, IBM plans to announce Monday a new, inexpensive server line called OpenPower that can run just the Linux operating system, CNET News.com has learned. The products, which use the new Power5 processor, run the open-source software but not AIX or i5/OS, the IBM operating systems that more commonly run on the Power machines, according to sources familiar with the plan. News.context What's new: IBM is set to announce a new, inexpensive and Linux-only server line called OpenPower. Bottom line: The move would shift Big Blue's Power chips beyond their high-end market to compete against lower-end Unix servers and x86 systems. The trick will be getting the Linux community fired up about it. More stories on this topic IBM is expected to price the line aggressively, sources said. The low cost would position the OpenPower products not only against lower-end Unix servers from Sun Microsystems based on the UltraSparc processor but also against servers from a number of companies using x86 chips such as Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron. That's a change from Power servers in the past, which have been aimed chiefly at higher-end servers using Sun's UltraSparc or Intel's Itanium. "Clearly IBM still has a vision that their Power architecture can become an industry standard and displace all those crummy x86s and Itaniums and Opterons," Insight64 analyst Nathan Brookwood said. "They clearly see that Linux is the vehicle that makes it easier for customers to move to the Power platform." Big Blue has a long way to go to reach x86 popularity, however. According to market researcher IDC, 4.7 million x86 servers were shipped last year, vastly more than the 118,000 Power servers. IBM has been working aggressively to promote its Power processor family. In January it said that it wanted Power servers to be the same cost as servers based on Intel processors. In May it began sharing Power details and design tools to help chipmakers make use of Power designs. And in August, IBM made it possible for programmers to use remote servers at the University of Portland for free to develop Linux software on Power. Since 2000, IBM has been an enthusiastic advocate of Linux, which brings some unification to Big Blue's four server lines and builds ties with an influential group of software developers. The company is investing billions of dollars in its Linux business, employing more than 300 programmers to work on the operating system and defending Linux against a legal attack by the SCO Group. But so far, Linux on Power remains a niche project with limited abilities and little appeal to those other than IBM's existing customers, said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. An offering like the OpenPower line is important for IBM to lift Linux on Power into the mainstream. "They have to get the Linux community excited about it," Haff said. "The broader ambition IBM has hinted at--that Linux on Power competes full-fledged with Linux on x86--really requires a much broader set of developers and partners." The potential expense of Linux on Power could be an inhibitor for at least one possible customer. "I personally would love to run Linux on the (PowerPC) 970s...but it's hard to justify the cost of a box," said Nathan Hruby, a system administrator at the University of Georgia who runs Linux, chiefly on x86 servers such as Hewlett-Packard's ProLiant DL380. "Equality in power, features and options with a similar (or better) price tag would probably make IBM Power5 machines look real good to us." IBM declined to comment for this story. View from the competition Rival Sun has respect for the performance of Power chips, but unsurprisingly contends that IBM will have a tough time winning over the mainstream Linux crowd, which--with x86 servers--has grown accustomed to having a choice of computer suppliers. "I think it's an interesting move on their part, but I think the market acceptance is going to be challenging," said John Fowler, executive vice president of Sun's Network Systems Group. "Part of what drives the Linux community is they have open hardware choices, not just the fact that the operating system is open." With OpenPower servers an IBM exclusive, Fowler said, "you have clumps of proprietary hardware dropped in the middle of it." That IBM exclusivity with Power isn't a certainty, though. Other companies, such as Momentum Computers, build components for computers using IBM's PowerPC 970 chip, and the PowerPC 970FX is used in Apple Computer's Xserve products. Fowler also argued that although "Power has some exceptional performance characteristics," it will be difficult to convince large numbers of software companies to create, test, support and market a new version of their software. But IDC analyst Jean Bozman said the barriers to moving applications from one version of Linux to another are lower than with other operating systems. "If you're one of the Wall Street guys (with custom software), it's something that in a Linux world can be moved around fairly easily," she said. IBM uses two varieties of Power processors in its servers today: the PowerPC 970 in the thin JS20 blade server and the higher-end Power4 and Power5 for more powerful machines. Although OpenPower today uses Power5, it's possible the PowerPC 970 also could play a role. "I would expect if Linux on Power starts to become mainstream in any way, that PowerPC is the obvious way to get the lowest cost per CPU," Haff said, though computer users would lose higher-end Power5 features such as the ability to let a single server run many independent operating systems. The JS20 blade server so far is available only with Linux, but IBM plans to make AIX available for it later. RedMonk analyst James Governor said that the OpenPower project should help IBM's Power propagation goals. "IBM needs to establish Power beyond its legacy installed base," Governor said. To that end, he said, OpenPower is a "good bold move."
2001-08-15 - IBM takes high road with new servers   IBM on Wednesday plans to unveil a new family of servers based on its Summit chipset technology and on high-end Intel microprocessors. The computing giant hopes the new xSeries servers will better its position in a battle with Dell Computer, Compaq Computer and Unisys to lead the Intel-based server market. Just as important, it will give IBM more ammunition in its effort to recover ground against server archrival Sun Microsystems. The company is expected to announce the servers at a software developers conference in San Francisco, according to an IBM spokeswoman. The systems will serve as a testing ground for Intel's 32-bit Xeon and 64-bit Itanium processors. Unlike most chipsets, Summit is ambidextrous--it will work with standard 32-bit chips as well as with the upcoming McKinley processor, a faster take on Itanium that will appear in test systems by the end of the year. McKinley is expected to be the first version of Itanium to be adopted for general commercial use. As previously reported, Summit allows IBM to incorporate features typically associated with its supercomputers and high-end server lines into generally less expensive Intel-based servers. Under the X Architecture initiative, IBM's more affordable server lines have gained features such as the ability to swap out memory and processors while the computer is running. Summit also is designed to permit corporations to put up to 16 processors in a single machine, IBM said. The xSeries servers consist of as many as four processor "quads." Each quad can have four processors and features its own memory and input-output abilities. The quads can communicate over a high-speed "scalability port." Although IBM has long been associated with the highest levels of computing, it began to hit the skids in the server market in the late 1990s. "It looked like Sun really had its act together. We didn't have a strategy to participate in this e-business thing," Bill Zeitler, senior vice president in charge of IBM's server group, said in an interview in March. Since then, Big Blue has been on the mend. News.com's Michael Kanellos contributed to this report.
2004-05-03 - IBM switches on Power5 servers IBM officially introduced its heavily expected Power5 server line on Monday. As previously reported, the servers are the first generation of boxes using IBM's new Power5 processor, a 64-bit chip meant to compete with high-end technology from Intel, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard. The introduction of the servers is believed to be the last step in IBM's convergence of its two server product lines, the iSeries and pSeries, which use identical hardware and are differentiated only by their operating system and other software. The company said the Power5 servers will officially go on sale June 11 and will be available in two eServer models, the i5 520, with one or two processors, and the i5 570, with one to four processors. An entry-level version of the i5 520 model will cost $9,995. Meanwhile, an i5 570 starts at $85,200. The servers, which run on the latest version of IBM's OS/400 operating system known as i5/OS, are aimed at small and midsize businesses. The servers are designed to appeal to customers who want systems with a good deal of software built in, including IBM's WebSphere and DB2 and third-party packages from companies such as SAP. The introduction of the two models marks the first step in IBM's "Squadron" server strategy. Later models are expected to feature as many as 64 processors, with each processor able to execute simultaneously two instruction sequences. During the third quarter, IBM is expected to introduce a midrange server, the i5 550, with up to four processors. Also at that time, the stacking of four-processor modules used in the i5 570 will move that system to a 16-processor size. While the new servers are expected to give IBM's rivals a run for their money in the midmarket arena, the company's closest competitors are betting on new technology of their own. Sun is hoping to steal back market share from IBM with new servers based on its UltraSparc IV and its Solaris version of Unix. HP is known to be working with Intel to use the Itanium processor for its servers, which can run Linux and Windows as well as the HP-UX version of Unix. CNET News.com's Stephen Shankland contributed to this report.
2000-05-11 - IBM supports new Java version  Despite its differences with Sun Microsystems, IBM will adopt the new version of Java as soon as possible, the company said. IBM was one of the early backers of Sun's Java software, which theoretically allows a program written in the Java language to run on any Java-enabled computer. However, the company has been unhappy with the degree of control Sun maintains over Java. IBM has said Sun "betrayed" IBM by going back on a verbal promise to turn control of Java over to an industry group. IBM still has Java firmly entrenched in its product line, working to speed up the "virtual machine" component of Java and using Java across its four server lines--the Netfinity, RS/6000, AS/400 and S/390. Sun released Java 2 version 1.3 this week. IBM will release Java 2 version 1.3 software for its four server lines by the summer, the company said. It will run on the Windows, Linux and OS/2 operating systems for Intel-based Netfinity servers. By the end of the year, Java will run on three operating systems on Intel's upcoming Itanium processor.
2002-11-15 - IBM supercomputer looms large  Bringing new meaning to the term "big iron," IBM has begun selling a new supercomputer that weighs nearly two tons in a full-fledged configuration. Each p655 Unix server is a four- or eight-processor module measuring seven inches high, 12 inches wide and 40 inches deep. When 16 of these modules are packed into a six-foot-tall rack designed for the servers, the collection weighs 3,600 pounds, said Jim McGaughan, director of IBM eServer product marketing. "Apparently, if you really fill one of these racks, you have to put in special floor-tile reinforcements," said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. "It's certainly a heavyweight computer in more ways than one." The system is geared to supercomputer customers, such as pharmaceutical companies or national laboratories, who need as much processing power in as little space as possible. To get similar supercomputer power before the introduction of the p655, IBM customers had been grouping 16-processor p670 servers or 32-processor p690 "Regatta" servers into clusters. However, those systems, with their higher capacity for data storage and networking bandwidth, are better adapted to general-purpose computing rather than supercomputing. IBM is proud of the fact that it can squeeze 128 processors in a six-foot rack without causing overheating problems. "This is quite a feat of engineering, to be very candid," McGaughan said. Overheating, which can cause processing errors, is a universal problem in computer design, but is particularly important for high-density systems such as the p655. A full cabinet with 16 of the p655 Unix servers, each with 4GB of memory and 218GB of hard-drive capacity, costs $2.1 million, McGaughan said. Customers who buy the p655 are more likely to gravitate toward systems with more memory, though; and when a system comes loaded with 16GB of memory, the list price goes up to about $2.6 million. At the less-expensive end of the spectrum, a single four-processor machine with 4GB of memory and 218GB of hard drive capacity costs about $70,000, he said. Supercomputer frenzy The supercomputing industry has entered a frenzy of activity in anticipation of the beginning of the SC2002 supercomputer show in Baltimore, scheduled for Nov. 18. On Thursday, Cray announced its new X1. In addition, SGI improved its top-end systems with the release of the Origin 3900 on Monday. Earlier, AMD--known mostly for building processors popular with consumers--announced it is building a system at Sandia National Laboratories. For its part, IBM is steadily gaining ground in the market for supercomputers, with major customers in the defense industry, in corporate research and in academia. However, Hewlett-Packard is also making a strong showing, both with its high-end systems based on technology it acquired from Compaq Computer and with numerous lower-end systems. HP is also exerting pressure on its supercomputer rivals with systems based on Intel's Itanium processor, which HP helped to design. "Itanium 2 hasn't made a big splash in general, but if you had to pick one area where it has gained some traction, it's in high-performance computing," Illuminata's Haff said. Though IBM also is embracing Itanium, much of its energy is devoted to its own Power4 chip. IBM packs four Power4 processors into a dense chunk of ceramic and wires called a multichip module, a technology taken from its mainframe line. Each Power4 chip actually has two processors, making it a "dual-core" chip. However, to build four-processor systems out of multichip modules that actually have eight processors, IBM disables one of the processors in each pair. Disabling half the chips might sound like a waste of silicon, but the technique has advantages in some circumstances because a single processor can exploit the double-strength infrastructure, such as communications lines and high-speed cache memory. IBM's new p655 systems can be joined with the company's high-speed SP Switch 2, a technique that makes it easier to spread supercomputing calculations across a cluster of computers. McGaughan said IBM expects roughly half of its p655 customers will use the high-speed switch, with the remaining clients linking their systems with the slower and more pedestrian Ethernet networks.
2002-09-24 - IBM set to wield flexible blades   IBM will unsheathe its first blade servers Tuesday, and with them a strategy for applying the blade concept to the design of networking equipment, storage devices and other products. The IBM eServer BladeCenter is the company's homegrown entry into the burgeoning market for blades, ultrathin computers that stand vertically in specialized racks. In all, IBM can fit 84 of its blade servers, each containing two 2.4GHz Intel Xeon processors each, into a 6-foot rack. Typically, these racks can hold 42 servers at most. But IBM isn't stopping there. The Armonk, N.Y.-based computing giant is working on blades that will accommodate four Xeon processors, hold Intel's Itanium or IBM's own Power 4 processors for more arduous computing tasks, incorporate several hard drives or accommodate networking equipment. In other words, if it comes in a box today, IBM wants it on a blade tomorrow. "Once you develop the chassis, you have a lot of flexibility built into it," said Jeff Benck, director of eServer marketing for IBM. "It (the BladeCenter rack) is intended to support a flexible infrastructure with an ability to incorporate a variety of technology." This evolution will likely help propel blades from the fringe of the computing market to the center, said David Freund, server technology analyst at Illuminata. Currently, most blades can be used only for relatively simple tasks, such as serving up Web pages. If IBM succeeds, these machines will run databases or be deployed for server consolidation, a technique that uses a group of servers for a large variety of functions. "They want to legitimize the blade in the commercial data center," said Freund. "Server consolidation--that's the play today that gets IT buyers' attention." AOL has already tested IBM's blades and expects to "deploy a considerable number" of blade racks, the company said in a statement. Blades dissected Since the beginning of 2001, companies large and small have touted the emergence of blades in the computer market. Rather than sitting horizontally in a rack or on a desk, blades slide vertically like record albums into a specialized rack that contains all the wiring necessary to hook the computers into the network. Although some companies are using the blade idea to replace desktops, most companies have applied the blade concept to servers. The architectural change brings a host of benefits, according to analysts and computer executives. For one thing, more blades can be fit into a centralized computer room, which economizes on real estate expenses. The increased density comes in part because blades share many components, which are actually incorporated into the rack. In the BladeCenter system, for instance, 16 blades rely on four power supplies and share CD-ROM drives. Ordinarily, each server would come with an individual power supply and drive. The amount of cable required to hook up these servers is reduced by 83 percent, said Mark Shearer, vice president of blade servers at IBM. The Fibre Channel switch for connecting the servers to a storage system is also incorporated into the rack. Typically, it comes as a separate piece of equipment. Even more important, corporate computer departments become easier to manage. Repurposing a server--that is, using it as a Web server one hour and as an e-mail server the next--is also much easier and quicker with blades because of complementary software-management tools. "It takes you something like 10 minutes to reposition another OS (operating system)," Freund said. Swapping out damaged components or blades takes far less time too. Honing blades Even though blades have been on the market only about 18 months, the basic architecture has already changed. Initially, companies like RLX Technologies incorporated notebook processors into their blade racks to cut down on power consumption and reduce heat. This allowed the company to pack several hundred computers into a six-foot rack. Pure density, however, wasn't a huge hit. IBM sold RLX servers for a while but dropped them after low sales: Customers wanted the same sort of performance they got with regular servers, even if it reduced maximum density. "The solutions that are out there don't let you do enterprise workloads," said Shearer. Following this path, IBM will begin to incorporate technologies found in its other lines into the BladeCenter. Four-processor Xeon blades will come out in the first quarter of next year, while blades for Itanium and Power 4 chips, usually used in IBM's most expensive machines, will come later. The company will also work with software developers and other hardware manufacturers in its Blade Server Alliance Program to tune or codevelop other products for BladeCenter. Microsoft and Red Hat, for instance, are currently validating software to work smoothly on BladeCenter. IBM is also working with Cisco and Nortel, alliances that could lead to Cisco-branded blades for the rack. All of these different blades will also fit into the same rack, said IBM's Benck. The company's services and leasing group is also concocting programs to ease adoption, Big Blue's Shearer added. In true IBM fashion, the BladeCenter also features a certain amount of flourishes, noted Freund. Each blade comes encased in a sheet metal sleeve that allows fans to create even channels of air for cooling. "If anything, it is overdesigned right now, so that in the future when you have more powerful processors from Intel or whomever, it can accommodate it," Illuminata's Freund said. HP follows a similar ethos. Its latest blade servers are only slightly more dense than traditional rack-mounted servers, but the company will be able to fit two- and four-processor blades into the rack. HP says it is selling 1,800 blades per month.
2001-11-26 - IBM server to trickle out in December  IBM will begin preliminary shipments of its first "Summit" servers in early December, the company plans to announce Monday, marking a key moment in Big Blue's effort to make systems based on Intel chips as serious as its other product lines. IBM has said its Summit systems are ready to go and will be generally available as soon as Intel launches its multiprocessor-capable Xeon chip, code-named Foster MP and due in the first quarter of 2002. But early shipments of the first Summit servers will begin in early December, the company plans to announce. The first Summit machine will be called the x360, part of the xSeries line of Intel-based servers, with Xeon chips running at 1.5GHz or 1.6GHz. The first systems will be rack-mountable, four-processor models. A "scalability port" and accompanying interconnecting cables will let customers group up to four systems into an eight-, 12- or 16-processor system. The systems will be generally available in early December but in limited quantities, IBM said. Pricing information was not available. The Summit chip for the server, formally called the XA-32 after the X Architecture initiative that spawned it, is the first chipset for Intel servers IBM has released. The chipset is a crucial chip that connects a computer's processor with other processors and with memory and input-output systems. Summit began as the XA-64 that will arrive when Intel ships the second generation of its high-end 64-bit Itanium chip line, code-named McKinley and expected in the first half of 2002. With the slipping Itanium schedules, though, IBM decided to add a 32-bit version for Intel's more common Xeon chips, a souped-up relative of its mainstream Pentium models. To squeeze four CPUs into a rack-mounted chassis 5.25 inches tall, IBM had to be creative in finding a way to keep the CPUs from overheating. Each chip sports a large water-cooled heat-radiation system, in which the chip's heat evaporates water that rises within a sealed mechanism and re-condenses into a liquid. It's similar to the way sweat cools a person, except that the system is sealed so water doesn't need to be replenished. The x360 has a 400MHz front-side bus, the data pathway that joins the chip to memory. It also has "remote I/O," which allows PCI cards to be plugged into a separate cabinet, alleviating the space constraints that usually limit the communication abilities of rack-mounted servers.
2002-08-22 - IBM server emphasizes upgrades IBM is pitching an upgrade-as-you-go server for medium-sized businesses. The new machine, introduced this week, is a version of the company's eServer x440. The new version allows businesses to select two- or four-processor configurations and then upgrade later to eight or 16 processors. Servers are networked computers that juggle a number of jobs from storing data for e-mail systems to conducting e-commerce and other transactions. IBM expects that cost-conscious businesses will purchase a machine that can be upgraded to do the job of several standalone servers instead of buying those extra machines later. The new x440 will ship with two or four 2.4GHz Intel Xeon processors. It can be upgraded to Intel's Xeon MP chip, which is designed for use in servers with four or more processors. The new x440 will start at about $20,000 and will be available by the end of August, IBM said. Although a number of companies, including Dell Computer, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems, offer four-, eight- and 16-processor servers, IBM claims this new variant of its x440 has an advantage because of the ability to add processors. IBM designed the x440's ="www.cnet.com resources="" info="" glossary="" terms="" corelogic.html"="">chipset, which is a group of chips that essentially controls the flow of data inside the machine, to be able to handle two-, four-, eight- and 16-processor configurations. Server makers all put an emphasis on upgradability, but in varying forms. Sun's servers, for example, can be upgraded with new versions of processors. Some of its more expensive server models can run a mixture of chips with different clock speeds. And forthcoming servers using Intel's Itanium 2 chips will upgradeable to future versions of that chip.
2005-02-25 - IBM server design drops Itanium support    IBM has cooled its already none-too-warm support for Intel's Itanium processor, a server chip that competes with Big Blue's own Power family, CNET News.com has learned. Citing tepid market demand, the world's largest server seller has for the time being ceased development of an electronics package called a chipset that's at the heart of Big Blue's Itanium servers. Since 1998, Big Blue has been developing its family of Enterprise X Architecture chipsets, vital components that connect central processors to memory and other parts of a computer. These chipsets could be used either with Intel's Xeon family of processors or with the chipmaker's higher-end but less widely used Itanium 2 models. News.context What's new: In a shift from its predecessors, the new generation of IBM's Enterprise X Architecture chipset family doesn't support Intel's Itanium chip. Bottom line: Big Blue's step away from Itanium is further evidence that customers generally prefer Intel's Xeon family, especially since it now includes 64-bit extensions that previously were a major Itanium advantage. More stories on Itanium But the third generation of the EXA chipset family--called X3 and launched Tuesday--only supports Xeon, said Tom Bradicich, chief technology officer of IBM's xSeries line of Intel-based servers. "We did forgo (Itanium support) on X3. It is a function of the market acceptance of Itanium," Bradicich said in an interview Tuesday. However, Itanium support could be reinstated with a successor called X4 if there is demand, he added. It's not a surprise that IBM isn't the strongest Itanium supporter, given its promotion of its own Power processors--one of the top two major RISC, or reduced instruction set computing, chip designs at which Intel is aiming Itanium. Even so, IBM's step away from Itanium is further evidence that customers generally prefer the Xeon family, especially since it now includes 64-bit extensions that previously were a major Itanium advantage. "The migration strategy Intel once imagined--which was at the point where Xeon users started knocking up against the limited headroom of Xeon...(and) would naturally want to migrate to Itanium--has largely been blown apart by the 64-bit extensions capability of (Advanced Micro Devices') Opteron and now 64-bit Xeon," said Pund-IT analyst Charles King. Intel sees things differently, pointing out that 40 of the world's 100 largest companies use Itanium servers. "There is significant opportunity for Itanium in the $21 billion market for RISC replacement, mainframe migration and high-performance computing," said spokeswoman Erica Fields. And several others besides Intel have their own Itanium chipsets: Silicon Graphics, NEC, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Unisys and Itanium co-developer Hewlett-Packard. The second generation of IBM's EXA chipset family links as many as 16 Itanium 2 processors in the x455 server, introduced in 2003, and as many as 32 Xeon processors in the x445. The new X3 chipset will be used in conjunction with Intel's Potomac and Cranford versions of Xeon. Another chipset, called X4, is in development and is scheduled to arrive roughly 18 months from now with the next generation of Xeon chips, Bradicich said. With X3, code-named Hurricane, IBM combined several previously separate chips into one, Bradicich said. Preceding chipsets had an easier time dealing with either Itanium or Xeon processors because a separate chip was used for the processor interface, but with X3, IBM integrated that interface into the main part of the chipset. That integration makes the chipset cheaper but also would have made Itanium support more expensive. The X3 chipset is used in IBM's four-processor x336 server, due to go on sale within 90 days, but X3 also will see use on higher-end multiprocessor systems, Bradicich said. "We have a lot of flexibility. We built this X3 Hurricane chip to scale for four, eight, 16 or 32 processors, plus it will accommodate dual-core in each of those configurations," he said. IBM spent more than $100 million over three years developing X3, he added. Dual-core processors combine two processing engines onto a single slice of silicon. Adding support for 32 dual-core processors led Bradicich last year to say that X3 would enable 64-processor Xeon servers. Since then, however, naming conventions have changed, and a dual-core chip is considered a single processor. Hurricane includes two major components, controllers for the computer's memory subsystem and a "scalability port" that is used to link four-processor groups together. With Hurricane's predecessor, the "Cyclone" memory controller and "Twister" scalability port controller were separate chips, Bradicich said. The memory controller was once linked to a large pool of high-speed external memory called a cache, but X3's access speeds are fast enough that the cache no longer is needed. The technology for addressing the cache memory remains in the chipset, though, as a way to speed access to needed data, he said. With X3, one component, code-named Calgary, is still separate. It links Hurricane to the input-output subsystem, which lets a computer use the faster PCI-X 2.0 connection technology compared with the PCI-X of the X3's predecessor. A new version of Calgary coming by the end of the year will build support for a newer input-output system called PCI Express. X3 also continues support for hardware partitioning technology that lets each four-processor unit house a separate operating system, Bradicich said. The communication channel that links the processor to the chipset is called the front-side bus. X3, like Intel's chipsets, uses a 667MHz front-side bus that's substantially faster than the 400MHz bus on current Xeons geared for four-processor machines. And like Intel's chipset, X3 also employs dual front-side buses for each chip, a move that makes it easier to accommodate the communication demands of future dual-core models, Bradicich said.
2000-05-11 - IBM seeks to eclipse Sun with new servers  IBM has spread the design of its top-end Unix server to three new midrange models as part of its continuing attempt to dislodge Sun Microsystems' market lead. The company today bolstered its RS/6000 server line with the six-processor H80 and F80 models and the eight-processor M80, said Mike Maas, manager of the product line. The systems are emerging amid fierce competition for the Unix server market driven by the growth of the Internet and corporate computing in general. IBM makes no bones about which company is its primary rival. "We are aimed directly at Sun," Maas said. "This is barrel two of the shotgun," the first being IBM's top-end S80 model, of which IBM has sold more than 1,600 units since its debut last fall. The announcement comes after chief executive Lou Gerstner's confession this week that the company has made several significant missteps over the last year, including problems in manufacturing hard drives for storage systems and servers. "We ceded the market to Sun, but we're coming back," Gerstner said. The company also announced today that Internet address registrar Network Solutions will use the new servers. Although Sun is somewhat vulnerable as it awaits new servers based on its upcoming UltraSparc III chip, analysts credit Sun for having strong demand and a dominant position. Server sales led Sun to a record $4 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter. IBM argues that the new midrange Unix servers beat Sun's systems in both price and performance. Sun criticizes IBM for having so many different server lines and operating systems, confusing customers and diluting its own product development and marketing. IBM counters that it can sell servers to a wider range of buyers. "Our view is customer choice is most important," Maas said. The new IBM servers use an improved Power chip from IBM with copper interconnect technology, which allows the chip to run faster and debuted in the S80, Maas said. The new servers also use the internal design of the S80, which allows faster transfer of data between the CPUs, memory, and input/output devices such as storage systems or network cards. The next generation of IBM Unix servers, due to debut this fall according to sources familiar with the company's plans, will use chips incorporating IBM's new silicon-on-insulator technology, which allows even faster chips. Hewlett Packard, SGI and Compaq, which also make Unix servers, are fighting for a part of the Unix server market as well. HP has an aggressive program to get its servers into the hands of start-ups and application service providers (ASPs). SGI expects to debut new servers based on its delayed R12K chip soon. Compaq, which is scheduled to release its new 32-processor "Wildfire" server May 16, said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing today that it has sold 120 systems and expects to ship at least 200 by the end of the first half of 2000. The high-end Unix server market is expected to become more crowded once Intel releases its Itanium chip later this year. The Itanium, the first in Intel's family of 64-bit "IA-64" processors, will enable Intel-based servers to address large databases and perform other tasks previously only possible with 64-bit chips from IBM, Sun, Compaq, SGI and HP. The H80 and F80 are similar in design, but the 8.75-inch tall H80 is designed to be bolted to a rack. The 14-inch tall M80 also can be rack-mounted. Entry-level prices begin at $18,995 for the F80, $21,995 for the H80 and $67,995 for the M80, Maas said. However, most customers don't buy such bare-bones configurations. More typical prices would be in the neighborhood of $40,000 for the F80 and H80, he said. An M80 complete with all eight processors will cost less than $200,000, Maas said. Internally, the M80 uses a "crossbar" design, a switch that opens up high-speed connections between components, such as a CPU and a network card that need to exchange information. The F80 and H80 use a less sophisticated "bus" design, in which all the components are connected to a shared data pathway.
2004-02-26 - IBM rises Sun sinks in server market   IBM widened its lead in the worldwide server market in 2003 at the expense of Sun Microsystems, making particular gains in the Unix server market, new figures show. Server revenue for IBM grew 10 percent to $14.8 billion from 2002 to 2003, outpacing the overall market's 5 percent growth, market research firm Gartner said Wednesday. IBM increased its share 1.7 percentage points to 32 percent of the $46.1 billion total market. In contrast, No. 3 server seller Sun saw its revenue decline 15 percent to $5.4 billion and its share drop 2.8 percentage points to 11.8 percent. No. 2 seller Hewlett-Packard grew 5 percent to $12.5 billion. Fourth-place Dell posted the fastest growth, 22 percent, to $4 billion, narrowing Sun's lead from 7.2 percentage points in 2002 to 3.2 percentage points in 2003, Gartner said. The server market is in major flux. Sun ascended faster than competitors, when the server market exploded in the late 1990s, then lost business faster, as the Internet mania evaporated, server buyers grew conservative and the economy went into recession. IBM largely missed the growth spurt but recognized its error and began aggressive development around servers using the Linux operating system, Intel's Xeon processor and its own Power processor. The latter chiefly run the company's own version of Unix, called AIX. In Unix servers, No. 3 IBM saw revenue grow 13 percent to $4.1 billion. Revenue for first-place Sun shrank 16 percent to $5.4 billion, while No. 2 HP saw revenue shrink 4 percent to $5.3 billion. The overall Unix server market shrank 4 percent to $16.7 billion, while the Linux server market grew 90 percent to $2.8 billion, Gartner said. HP was the top seller of Linux servers, Gartner found, with sales that increased 60 percent to $927 million. IBM passed Dell for second place, with Big Blue rising 60 percent to $552 million and Dell rising 40 percent to $521 million. For years, the server market has been consolidating, giving the top companies an ever-larger share. In the overall market, the top four players garnered 80 percent of the revenue in 2003, compared with 79 percent in 2002. That trend was reversed in the Linux market, though, where the top three companies went from 76 percent of the market to 72 percent. The market for servers using Intel processors and Intel-compatible processors--Intel's Xeon and Itanium and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron, for example--grew 18 percent to $20.3 billion, Gartner said. Here, HP maintained its No. 1 rank with $6.8 billion in sales. Its market share dropped 0.4 percentage points to 34 percent, however. In Intel servers, No. 2 Dell grew 22 percent to $4 billion, with its market share increasing 0.7 percentage points to 20 percent. IBM's revenue increased 21 percent to $3.4 billion, or 17 percent of the market.
2002-12-18 - IBM releases 16-chip Intel servers IBM has begun shipping 16-processor x440 servers, its highest-end mainstream machines using Intel chips, the company plans to announce Wednesday. The system consists of two eight-processor, rack-mounted systems that are 7 inches tall and connected with high-speed cables. It's the current flag-bearer for IBM's sustained effort to build ever more powerful Intel servers. The system uses the first version of Intel's Xeon MP processor, code-named Foster MP. An x440 with 16 processors and 8GB of memory costs $81,000, said Deep Advani, vice president of IBM's xSeries servers. The price impressed Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice, who said that up until recently that much money would get a customer only an eight-processor server. "I think it's the killer commodity system," he said. The x440 has a "dramatically lower price than any of the RISC alternatives," which are more-customized machines from companies such as Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and IBM itself. For example, Sun's eight-processor V880 with 16GB of memory costs $100,000. That system, however, uses 64-bit processors that more gracefully handle large amounts of memory. Intel's Itanium processor deals better with memory constraints. IBM plans to release an Itanium version of the x440 with four processors in early 2003, executives have said. Later in the year will come a 16-processor Itanium version and a 32-processor Xeon version. The 16-processor x440's usefulness is limited by the comparative scarcity of software that runs well on high-end Intel servers, Eunice said. Although Microsoft's Windows operating system is getting better at taking full advantage of all the chips, higher-level software such as Exchange still needs work, he said. Linux support will arrive later on the 16-processor x440, Advani said. "Linux right now scales pretty well to eight-way servers, and as it starts to scale beyond that we'll focus on that as well," he said. Beginning early in the first quarter, IBM will support the newer Gallatin model of Xeon, which has more high-speed cache memory and therefore better performance, Advani said. For a time, IBM sold high-end Intel servers inherited from its 1999 acquisition of Sequent, including a fleeting few months with a 64-processor system on the market. IBM discontinued that line in December 2001, but some of the Sequent technology lives on in IBM's Enterprise X Architecture chips that connect all the x440's processors to one other and to the server's memory banks.
2004-06-21 - IBM regains supercomputer bragging rights  IBM has regained dominance on a list of the 500 fastest supercomputers and has also landed two unusual prototypes in the top 10. News.context What's new: IBM built 224 of the 500 fastest supercomputers and hopes its Blue Gene/L design will carry it to the No. 1 spot within six months. Bottom line: Big Blue believes its designs should allay concerns that the United States is losing its supercomputing edge to Japan. And low-cost clusters of machines now account for more than half the systems on the list. More stories on this topic Of the systems on the latest Top500 list, Big Blue built 224 and Hewlett-Packard built 140, giving IBM back the lead it lost in 2001. Two new systems, ranked No. 4 and No. 8, are prototypes of Blue Gene/L, a system that uses vastly less space and power than its competitors. IBM calls the prototype systems evidence that its years-long research effort is bearing fruit. But HP, which in 2003 had the most sales in the broader high-performance technical computing market, counters that it had the same number of new systems on the list--108--as IBM. The list, released twice a year at supercomputing conferences, is based on a mathematical speed test called Linpack. The top system--NEC's long-dominant, 5,120-processor Earth Simulator--can perform 35.8 trillions of calculations per second, or 35.8 teraflops. Linpack measures one aspect of supercomputer performance, but list organizer Jack Dongarra of the University of Tennessee is working on a broader suite of tests so a government supercomputing project can gain a better-rounded view. He expects the Top500 to stick with the Linpack yardstick, though. New arrivals As with November's Top500 list, there are plenty of new entrants. The 1-teraflop threshold, crossed by 12 systems three years ago, now has been attained by 242 systems. The new No. 1 IBM has pushed HP aside for having the most systems on the Top500 supercomputer list. ManufacturerTop500 systems (%) Nov. 2003June 2004 IBM31.844.8 Hewlett-Packard33.028.0 Silicon Graphics8.24.2 Sun Microsystems4.03.0 User-built4.42.8 Cray4.02.6 Dell3.62.6 Source: Top500 And the bottom-ranked system on this list was the 242nd six months ago--record turnover, according to the list organizers at the University of Mannheim, the University of Tennessee and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. As expected, the No. 2 position is held by California Digital's Thunder, a system at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that boasts 4,096 of Intel's Itanium 2 processors and a speed of 19.9 teraflops.  Also new in the top 10 is an IBM system at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts that features 2,112 Power4 + processors. It ranks sixth with a speed of 9 teraflops. Fujitsu's Super Combined Cluster at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research reached 8.7 teraflops. There's also a Chinese system, the Dawning 4000A, which sports 2,560 Advanced Micro Devices Opteron processors and can manage a speed of 8 teraflops. Missing during this go-around is Apple Computer's System X at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, which soared to the No. 3 position in November then vanished for an upgrade to newer hardware. AMD's Opteron, which first arrived on the list six months ago, has made substantial inroads with 30 systems on the list. There also were 30 of IBM's BladeCenters--chassis that holds many slim "blade" servers. One of them--a 168-processor system at the Joint Supercomputer Center in Moscow--uses IBM's JS20 blades. The JS20 uses the same PowerPC 970 processors that were in the System X. Blue Gene moving up The Blue Gene/L machines--three of which have been sold so far--are an unusual design based on a variation of IBM's Power family of processors. Each chip has dual processors, and each processor has built-in circuitry to communicate with five separate networks. That means the systems don't need a separate, expensive switch to link all the processors, and that doubling the number of processors comes close to doubling the overall performance, said Bill Pulleyblank, a director of IBM's Deep Computing group. The top 10 Here are the 10 most powerful supercomputers, as of June 2004. NEC's Earth Simulator California Digital's Thunder at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Hewlett-Packard's ASCI Q at Los Alamos National Laboratory IBM's Blue Gene/L DD1 prototype at the Thomas Watson Research Center Dell's Tungsten at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications Two IBM Power4-based clusters at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' High Performance Computing Facility Fujitsu's Super Combined Cluster at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, also known as Riken IBM's Blue Gene/L DD2 prototype at the Thomas Watson Research Center HP's Itanium-based cluster at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Dawning's 4000A at Shanghai Supercomputer Center Source: Top500 IBM built two prototypes, the No. 4 ranked system, with 8,192 500MHz processors and a speed of 13.8 teraflops, and the No. 8 ranked machine, with 4,096 700MHz processors and a speed of 8.7 teraflops. The 700MHz chips will be used in a Blue Gene/L, the construction of which will start this fall at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. There's a "good chance" the Livermore system will top the Top500 this November, said Dave Turek, leader of the Deep Computing team. He scoffs at governmental fretting that the United States is losing dominance to the Japanese because of Earth Simulator. "The trajectory of it is already clear. Those parties who might be wringing their hands about the supremacy of the Japanese ought to be wringing their hands about something else," Turek said. One of the reasons is compactness. The top-ranked Blue Gene/L is about the size of eight refrigerators. The Earth Simulator, though three times faster, occupies a room 71 yards long and 55 yards wide. IBM eventually plans to make a product out of Blue Gene/L--but not yet. "When does Blue Gene make the transition from our characterization as a research project to a more mainstream product? We're not ready to make that declaration yet," Turek said. "Pretty soon we'll be able to declare our intent here." IBM also is working on another design, Blue Gene/C. Pulleyblank acknowledges that its chips have many more processors on each slice of silicon, but otherwise remains mum. A growing market Supercomputers are at the high end of the much larger high-performance technical computing market, which is growing faster than the overall economy. Market researcher IDC expects the market to expand from $6.1 billion in 2004 to $7.6 billion in 2008. Unit shipments will grow even faster, from about 112,000 in 2004 to about 176,000 in 2008, according to the forecast. It's common for falling computer prices to mean that shipment growth outpaces revenue growth. But in the high-performance technical computing market, the trend is reinforced by the idea of computing clusters--groups of low-end systems linked with high-speed networks. Clusters, often using Linux running on computers with Intel or AMD processors, don't run some jobs as efficiently as more monolithic designs. But they work well enough at a low enough price that major customers are snapping them up. For example, of the seven Boeing supercomputers on this Top500, six are clusters using Xeon processors and one is a Cray X1. And clusters let Dell, a company better known for its reliance on Intel and Microsoft research than its own engineering abilities, build the No. 5 system called Tungsten at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. Clusters, which also can be assembled from higher-end parts, accounted for 281 of the 500 systems, for the first time crossing the halfway mark. But some jobs aren't amenable to cluster approach--one being decryption of coded communications. And there still is a large market for modest machines, such as those with four or eight processors churning away on jobs such as structural and stress analysis, said Bruce Toal, HP's marketing director of high-performance technical computing. Big Blue is getting bigger in the market, nearing HP's top rank. From 2002 to 2003, IBM's share of the market grew from 28.2 percent to 30.2 percent with sales of $1.62 billion. HP, with $1.79 billion in revenue for 2003, shrank slightly from 33.6 percent to 33.5 percent. Next in line in 2003 were Sun Microsystems, with $981 million in revenue, Dell with $387 million, Silicon Graphics with $224 million, Cray with $157 million and NEC with $67.5 million, according to IDC. HP likes to direct attention to the overall market share statistics. But it's clear the company still has ambitions for the Top500. "It is a two-horse race," Toal said, conceding the loss to IBM on the current list, "but stay tuned for next time."
2001-03-19 - IBM recovering from Sun blindness  About two years ago, IBM realized it had fallen in the very market responsible for its initial success--the powerful server computers that lie at the heart of corporate networks. Two major companies afflicted the computing colossus: Sun Microsystems and IBM itself. While Sun captured the energy of the Internet, IBM salespeople fought themselves instead of their competitors. To correct that course, IBM has rolled its four server lines into one brand name, eServer. Top server executives are compensated based on the success of all servers, not just their individual product lines. IBM has appointed "eServer managers" for major customers to make sure one IBM server line doesn't compete against another. Research and development is spreading technology from high-end product lines to lesser siblings. In other words, Big Blue thinks its server business is back on its feet. "I am convinced we are on the right strategy to win the most important battle," Bill Zeitler, senior vice president in charge of IBM's server group, said in an interview. Recent figures from IDC provide modest reinforcement for IBM's optimism. Though its server sales for all of 2000 grew 4 percent, to $13.6 billion--three points slower than the rest of the market--a strong fourth quarter showed 31 percent growth to $4.5 billion, compared with 14 percent growth for the market overall. "All the moves they've made are pretty darned positive," said Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice. But the question now is not whether IBM's products are good--it's whether IBM will be less damaged than competitors by the economic slowdown. Servers don't look like the salvation they once did from the fickle, low-margin PC business. With dot-com companies collapsing and corporations delaying computing projects, IBM no longer looks as insulated from economic troubles that have afflicted Compaq Computer and others with a heavier dependence on PCs. "We have spoken with the chief information officers at a number of large financial services corporations, and they indicated they have started to slow their purchases of mainframe" computing power, Merrill Lynch analyst Tom Kraemer said in a report Friday. That news could be a problem for those hoping mainframes would be a bright spot in the current environment, he said. One element of today's ugly market could work to the advantage of IBM and Hewlett-Packard over less-established Sun, said Gartner analyst Tom Henkel. "I'm sure as pain goes, Sun is probably feeling a little more pain than HP and IBM," Henkel said. "For a long time, the dot-com revenue was the turbocharger that kept pushing Sun to outstanding quarters." Dot-com companies often were "blank slates" starting their computing systems from scratch, but HP and IBM have an advantage when adding to traditional companies' mix of numerous server types. In the big picture, IBM has made major progress, Henkel said. "IBM is much more frequently on client short lists," Henkel said. "Two years ago, we saw HP and Sun on 80 percent of calls, with IBM on 50 percent. HP and IBM have virtually swapped places. More often than not, we're seeing an IBM vs. Sun scenario." Now IBM must convert internal changes to market success while Sun is distracted with overhauling its servers with the new UltraSparc III chip, Henkel said. "They've probably got 12 to 18 months to really score some big wins," he said. "Certainly between now and the end of the calendar year is the strongest opportunity, given the delays in the UltraSparc III and the difficulties Sun has had with UltraSparc II." But in the long run, IBM believes servers, and therefore IBM, will prevail. "We're coming into the golden age of servers," Zeitler said. The dark days IBM was not always this cheery. "In 1997, they had a really dismal product line," Illuminata's Eunice said. Internal competition also made IBM an easy target for Sun. "It's like a Third World nation where one group of the army turns its guns on another group of the army and tries to execute a coup." Zeitler acknowledged that IBM's strategy had been disorganized. "We had these products selling against each other," he said--a telling admission given the company's history of downplaying the issue. And worse, "It looked like Sun really had its act together. We didn't have a strategy to participate in this e-business thing." For Rod Adkins, the low point was October 1998, when he took his current job at the helm of IBM's pSeries Unix server division. "We just weren't engaged in the marketplace like Sun. Sun was the undisputed champion," he said. Naturally, Sun agrees. "We are hitting them where it hurts. We are in the depths of the data center," said Shahin Khan, head of server marketing for Sun. "They are now putting their crosshairs on us." Khan acknowledged, though, that IBM has more resources to take on Sun than vice versa. "I can't outspend them. I can't out-advertise them. I can't out-people them," he said. But he contended that Sun's products are years ahead of IBM's, and IBM still is overly attached to the flagging mainframe business. "I think IBM is a mainframe company and always will be a mainframe company," Khan said. "I think Sun is a scalable Internet infrastructure company, and that's where the future is going." Maybe so. But mainframes, while admittedly a declining business, still are lucrative, Eunice said. "It's better for IBM to sell a zSeries" (mainframe) than a lower-end IBM server, Eunice said. Mainframes have higher profit margins, lock customers in for future purchases more effectively, and generate more continuing service revenue, he said. IBM indeed is proud of its mainframe technology. And even Khan admits that Sun gets high-end Unix server technology ideas from mainframes. Divide and conquer "Partitioning," which lets customers divide servers such as Sun's top-end E10000 machine into several independent computers, is a standard mainframe feature. But as Khan likes to ask, "Why should it be that it's (Sun's) Solaris that offers partitioning and not IBM's version of Unix?" Sun was there first with Unix servers that could be partitioned, but IBM's "Regatta" Unix server, due this fall, likely will outpace Sun's partitioning technology, Eunice said. Where the smallest partitions allowed on Sun machines are four-processor boards, Regatta will feature mainframe-like abilities to have a partition running on a single processor or even a fraction of a processor, he said. "It's not like a mainframe, it is a mainframe," Eunice said. "Five years ago, that would have been death, but today I don't think you have to apologize for using mainframe components." IBM is bringing chip packaging technology as well as partitioning from mainframes to Unix servers, Zeitler said. "Multichip modules," the grouping of several chips within a single package that first was used by IBM in its mainframes in 1998, also will arrive with Regatta, Eunice said. "Multichip modules are serious big-iron technology," Eunice said. "There is a genuineness to the cross-product line sharing that is coming about...It makes me bullish on their ability not to spend all their time bickering with each other." Intel servers rise within IBM Technology sharing also has boosted IBM's Intel server line. "When we first came here, the Intel servers were big desktops. These are now small mainframes," said John Callies, general manager of IBM eServer appliances. The earlier attitude to Intel servers at IBM was derisive, Callies said. Now, with advances such as 16-CPU Intel servers based on IBM's Summit supporting chips, "We're not a joke anymore." But the Intel server business has been hampered by the numerous delays of Itanium, the first in Intel's line of more powerful 64-bit CPUs that the chipmaker hopes will displace competing CPUs from Sun, Compaq, SGI, HP and IBM. "I'm disappointed that the benefits are going to come 24 months after we originally anticipated," Callies said. Things should improve with the arrival of McKinley, Intel's second-generation 64-bit CPU. "You're going to see a completely different definition of what Intel servers are," Callies said. Linux: The Tie that Binds It wasn't part of the initial plan, but an unexpected force arrived to inject energy into IBM's server overhaul: Linux. The operating system, though not the easy road to riches many start-ups had hoped, has shaken Microsoft out of its leisurely assault on Unix. In early 1999, IBM merely announced its Intel servers would work with Linux, adding it to the stable of more than a dozen operating systems it already supported. Later, though, IBM's Linux love affair grew more serious. It decided to spread Linux to all four server lines and in December said it spent $1 billion on Linux in 2000 and pledged to spend even more in 2001. "It turns out Linux is the enabler that lets you (bring) applications into all these different environments," IBM's Zeitler said. Java had some promise for that job, too, and IBM is spreading Java across its server lines, but Big Blue wasn't comfortable with the degree of control inventor Sun has over Java. "It was proprietary. It was controlled too tightly," Zeitler said. IBM's strategy to push Linux across all four of the main server lines has helped unify IBM's server groups, Eunice said, by simplifying the use of higher-level software such as databases or the Websphere e-commerce package. Perhaps more important, Linux has changed IBM's popularity among programmers and has raised the company's profile in a very similar way to what Sun accomplished with its Java software. "As Goethe said, boldness has a magic to it," Eunice said. "The fact that they took this wild, completely committed swing at Linux--I think that's very appealing to people. It says IBM is moving back to innovation. You can't buy that kind of positive feeling. Now it's Sun that's on the defensive about Linux." Making Linux a priority on the mainframe was a great idea for customers that would like to split a single mainframe into hundreds of different virtual Linux computers, IDC analyst Dan Kusnetzky said. Scandinavian telecommunications company Telia has taken that approach, and IBM is working with Princeton University and Japan's Keio University on programs that would give students their own piece of a mainframe, IBM has said. "Having 1,500 Linux images on one (mainframe) is drastically cheaper to manage than 1,500 separate appliances," Kusnetzky said. "You could have $50 million to $60 million savings just on administrative staff, and that doesn't even include savings on floor space, air conditioning and maintenance." Telia believes it is likely to have 2,000 to 3,000 small businesses using its services soon, said Illuminata analyst James Governor. "At that point, the economies of scale kick in, and the mainframe begins to make sense," he said. "This is like the Holy Grail. This is the fabled new mainframe installation. Sun just got out-consolidated by IBM," he added, referring to the strategy Sun has used to sell its computers as a way to consolidate multitudes of Windows servers. And Linux is a boost to IBM's business partners as well. Sytek Services, for example, has been selling IBM mainframes for 14 years--but not to the 1,500 largest customers, which IBM keeps to itself. But when Linux is involved in the sale, Sytek "can sell to any company we want," said Sytek President Robert Kusche. Stand and deliver With IBM speaking so boldly about getting its act together, it's now time for the company to deliver the goods. Prognosticators are varied on how well Big Blue will do. "I was very skeptical when they started," Eunice said, but the latter stages of IBM's server overhaul have come when IBM has been in a position of some strength. "They did not do it when they were in bad times. There was something here other than trying to mask bad results or a dismal future." Change has to be deeper than just top server executives cooperating more, Henkel said, and he's not convinced of how deeply the new philosophy has penetrated IBM. "Often, what you see in reality is that individual sales reps tend to default to the things they know best," Henkel said. "One of the challenges we see facing IBM is coordinating the messages among the different (server lines). Things are never as simple as the cookbook."
2005-10-04 - IBM rebuilds Unix servers with Power5 chip IBM will bring the new Power5+ processor to its Unix server line this month, increasing performance and competitive pressures on Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Intel, the company plans to announce Tuesday. As expected, the new chip will run at a speed of 1.9GHz and will be showing up only in the lower end of IBM System p5+ models, a new name for what had been the pSeries and eServer p5. Those machines run either Linux or, more often, IBM's AIX version of Unix, but IBM will phase out the previously Linux-only aspect of its OpenPower models, said Jeff Howard, program director for P5 product marketing. In addition, IBM will debut a new model using the earlier Power5 generation of the chip, the p5-505, which, for the first time, gives Big Blue a "pizza box" 1.75-inch-thick system, Howard said. The Power5+, like the Power4, 4+ and 5 before it, has two processing engines, called cores. Using the dual-core approach helped IBM fight its way back into a Unix server market that had been dominated by Sun and HP, and now dual-core chips are showing in the mainstream server market as well, using x86 chips from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. "A fast chip got faster," Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff said of IBM's Power5+. "This certainly helps to cement their strong current position." The new Power5+ models will be available worldwide Oct. 14. Among them: the p5-520, with two processor cores; the p5-550, with two or four processor cores; the p5-550Q, which has four or eight cores, and uses a new technology that packs two physical processors into a single multichip module; and the p5-575+ with 16 Power5+ cores and a general focus on high-performance technical computing. Big Blue also is selling the IntelliStation Power 285 with one or two cores. For "Express" configurations for smaller customers, prices range from $5,750 for a two-core p5-505 to $11,896 for a two-core p5-520 to $37,428 for an eight-core p5-550. Power5+ is the second of three major high-end server processor families to undergo a major manufacturing transition from a process with 130-nanometer features to one with 90-nanometer features. (A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.) The new process permits more circuitry to be packed into the same amount of silicon or an existing chip design to fit on a smaller chip that costs less per unit to make and consumes less power when running. A smidgen earlier in the transition is Sun, which announced in September that it is selling servers with the 90-nanometer UltraSparc IV+ in addition to the older 130-nanometer UltraSparc IV. Next in line is Intel, whose 90-nanometer "Montecito" version of Itanium will replace the current 130-nanometer Madison generation. HP builds its newer Unix servers using Itanium chips, whose architecture it initiated and co-developed. But where Power5+ and UltraSparc IV+ are "shrinks" of existing dual-core designs, Montecito is a more radical departure, meaning that Intel will, for the first time, have a dual-core Itanium. The Power5+ processor comes with a higher-speed DDR2 (double data rate 2) memory interface, Howard said. Overall, server speed tests increase 15 percent to 20 percent, depending on the test, and the power consumption is lower, he added. IBM's midrange and high-end p5 models have yet to get the Power5+ treatment. Those include the p5-570, with eight dual-core chips, the p5-590, with 16 dual-core chips, and the top-end p5-595, with 32 dual-core chips. "Customers can expect midrange and high-end systems next year," Howard said. He wouldn't detail processor frequencies, but current Power5 chips run faster on high-end models, and Howard added, "You can expect 1.9GHz is not the highest frequency you'll see on Power5+." Also coming later will be i5 systems, identical hardware that runs IBM's i5/OS operating systems and is marketed toward midsize customers who want machines with a full collection of tightly integrated software. The end of new Linux-only OpenPower systems is in response to customer demand for dual operating-system support. "They have said, 'We just want the maximum flexibility,'" Howard said.
2002-10-23 - IBM puts power in new "blade" server   IBM unveiled a new "blade" server prototype Tuesday that uses its Power processor, putting Big Blue a step ahead in the race to squeeze high-end chips into compact servers. Some of the world's largest server companies--IBM, Sun Microsystems, Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard--have all dived into the market for blade servers, compact computer systems that are able to fit side-by-side into a larger chassis. Blade servers became popular as a method to stack a number of low-end servers into a small area to save office space. Now, that original concept has been expanded to higher-end servers with more complex processors. Low-end servers have typically used Intel Pentium chips. Now, more powerful blade servers incorporate Xeon processors. IBM is continuing this trend by using Power processors--the 64-bit family of chips that drive its pSeries Unix server line--for its blade servers. IBM on Wednesday unveiled a pair of dual-processor blades during a customer conference in Palm Springs, Fla., said Tim Dougherty, IBM's director of blade strategy. IBM's pSeries servers typically run Unix, but for its Power blades, the company expects the Linux operating system to be more popular, he said. IBM expects customers with technical computing needs, such as the formation of supercomputing "clusters," will use its Power blade servers, Dougherty said. Linux, available for free and open to customization, is more widely used among supercomputer customers. "I think people will predominantly be looking for the Power blade to be running Linux," he said. The servers will also run AIX, IBM's version of Unix, he added. Blade designs are likely to catch on because they emphasize better management features and share infrastructure, so fewer components, such as power supplies, are required, said Illuminata analyst David Freund. Ultimately, most servers with four or fewer processors will likely be blades. "For the four-way and down, they are a preferred form factor for rack-mounted servers going forward, regardless of processor," Freund said. Servers run round-the-clock computing tasks, managing e-mail accounts or reconciling bank account transactions. Early blade servers managed low-end computing tasks, such as serving Web pages, but the higher-power models are geared for more complex tasks, such as running the interface for an online bank. Dougherty didn't disclose which member of IBM's Power processor family the blade servers would use, but acknowledged that it could use a repackaged version of the Power4 processor used in IBM's high-end Unix servers. In current products, the Power4 is packaged in groups of four into large, power-hungry "multichip modules" ill-suited for skinny blade servers. The company said that it plans to build servers that use the Power4 processor without the multichip module. One advantage of the Power4 over competing chips is that it actually has two processors on each slice of silicon, making it easier to build a dual-processor blade server. While IBM is ahead of competitors in the hardware designs of these blade servers, Hewlett-Packard has the lead in creating software to manage such systems, Freund said. Sun and HP also are working on blade servers with their own competing chips. Sun had expected that it would sell its first UltraSparc blades this year, but a representative said Wednesday that the product might ship "within the next two quarters." HP is selling increasingly powerful general-purpose blades, but doesn't plan to use its own PA-RISC chip for those products. Instead, it will use Intel's Itanium processor, a company representative said. IBM's blades incorporate an expansion card that connects each server to a high-speed communication network. Current blade products will use that facility to connect to special-purpose storage data networks that use the Fibre Channel standard. But the technology will also work for networks and switches similar to the Myricom network popular in supercomputing clusters. IBM will include not just the networking equipment for each server, but also the switch that joins the servers, Dougherty said. "We talk about having a cluster switch available in 2003...integrated into our chassis," he said. Dougherty declined to say when the Power blades would be available, but added that he didn't expect a release this year. The company will start with one- and two-processor blade servers, extending to four-processor blade servers at a later date.
2001-11-14 - IBM prepares sequel to Summit server   LAS VEGAS--IBM still is months from launching its most important Intel server, based on a chip that enables a 16-processor system, but already Big Blue is contemplating a 32-processor successor as well as plans to license the first model to other companies. IBM has been working on chipset called Summit and now formally named Enterprise X Architecture that hooks together four of Intel's upcoming Xeon server processors with memory and other subsystems. Summit servers are ready to go and will debut at the same time Intel releases the chip, said Tom Bradicich, director of architecture and technology for IBM's Intel server group. "This is a good time to be us," said a confident Bradicich during a briefing at the Comdex Fall 2001 trade show. Intel spokesman Otto Pijpker would only reiterate that Xeon is scheduled to arrive in the first half of 2002, but one source familiar with the schedule said the Xeon for multiprocessor servers will arrive late in the first quarter of 2002. IBM is eagerly awaiting the launch, Bradicich said, the most important step yet in the company's "X Architecture" plan to use IBM technology to push Intel servers beyond the status of buffed-up PCs. Since the program began in October 1998, IBM has improved memory and the PCI communications subsystem, but Summit represents a major overhaul. The next generation of the design, called Enterprise X Architecture 2, will enable 32-processor servers, Bradicich said. It's due in 2 1/2 to three years. There's more than ego on the line. Summit took about $20 million and three years to develop, he said. One way IBM hopes to recoup that investment is by letting other server makers use the design, Bradicich said, though he didn't reveal which companies are interested. "We are negotiating licensing this," he said, although IBM will keep much of its own software to differentiate its products from others. Dell Computer, which doesn't invest as much in server research as rivals Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer or IBM, is one contender. Compaq isn't a likely contender, though, because it's working on its own eight-processor Xeon server. Convincing competitors to use high-end Intel server designs isn't easy: Unisys signed up Compaq and HP to sell its ES7000 CMP system and hoped to spread it farther, but the two companies dumped the design in the end, leaving only Dell to resell the machine. The drawbacks of Intel servers IBM is gung-ho on the benefits of tapping into the Intel server market, which brings with it lower component costs and a large collection of software. But the X Architecture effort also has revealed the perils of the approach: IBM can't control all aspects of the designs. Big Blue thus is beholden to Intel and Microsoft, two companies whose products are slowly penetrating into higher-end jobs typically run by Unix servers and mainframes. For example, the Summit chipset originally was designed to work with Intel's 64-bit Itanium processor family, Bradicich said. But Itanium chips are arriving years behind schedule, and IBM was able to update Summit for 32-bit chips by swapping out a supporting chip that handles communication with the processor. Even the 32-bit chip plans have had some lumps. Intel released a two-processor Xeon chip for workstations, the first chip based on the newer Pentium 4 CPU, but decided not to sell it for server use, instead waiting for a faster successor called "Prestonia." For multiprocessor machines, though, the earlier-generation "Foster" models of Xeon will be used, with a successor called "Gallatin" scheduled to arrive in late 2002. Microsoft also can be a bottleneck. Currently, Windows 2000 DataCenter, Microsoft's top-end operating system, is billed to work on 32-processor servers, but Bradicich said 16-processor models are realistically as big as most customers will go, in particular because higher-level software such as database programs must be carefully written to take advantage of multiprocessor systems. IBM can do only so much to improve the operating system, even with a joint development center near Microsoft. For example, IBM is working with Microsoft to take better advantage of a Summit feature that allows a system to be divided into several independent "partitions," a feature more frequently found in high-end Unix servers. Currently, the machine must be shut down before any partition changes can take effect, Bradicich said, a major step short of the dynamic partitioning of Unix servers. There's always Linux, though, over which Big Blue can exert a little more control. "We're looking at that technology for Linux," Bradicich said of dynamic partitioning. Summit details IBM first began talking about Summit in July 2000. It then revealed that the system is made of four four-processor blocks connected with a high-speed "scalability port." A year ago, IBM said Summit will work with both Intel's prevailing 32-bit CPU designs and its radically different 64-bit Itanium processor family brethren, beginning with its second-generation model code-named "McKinley." Now more details are emerging. In addition to the partitioning capability, IBM said Summit comes with as much as 64MB of high-speed cache memory shared by each four-processor unit. This immense cache has very low delays, Bradicich said. And Summit can keep track of what information is stored in the cache, so processors can find it more quickly or know when to retrieve it from slower main memory. Each four-processor system will house 8GB to 16GB of memory. The system also comes with memory-mirroring technology that lets one bank of memory step in if one fails. And with "bit steering," memory modules with less drastic failures can take advantage of unused memory communication channels. Defective memory can be replaced or new memory added without shutting the system down, Bradicich added. The system comes with six high-speed PCI-X communication channels and a remote input/output cable that can link a server to another drawer full of as many as 24 PCI-X slots. Summit will be built by IBM Microelectronics using advanced copper and silicon-on-insulator chipmaking technologies, Bradicich said. By the time the system ships, the chipset will likely be built using 130-nanometer (0.13 micron) features.
2003-11-14 - IBM Power blades to arrive in March    IBM plans to announce on Tuesday a thin blade server that uses its own Power processors, but a delay means the system won't ship until March--just ahead of a counterattack by Hewlett-Packard. The JS20 server module will house two 1.6GHz PPC 970 processors, which go by the name G5 in desktop computers from Apple Computer. Although IBM plans to make its AIX version of the Unix operating system available for the blades, the company will position Linux as the first choice for the systems, said Jeff Benck, vice president of IBM's BladeCenter line. IBM is also planning more-powerful Power blade servers, with four processors. "Four-way Power is something our customers have asked us about. We're not going to have it in the first half of next year, but it is something we see in the road map," Benck said. Blades are an emerging technology that pack numerous servers into a chassis that provides shared infrastructure such as power supplies and external networking connections. Promised benefits include better management software, fewer cable snarls, more expansion options and smaller floor-space requirements. The PPC 970 is a 64-bit processor, meaning it can use vastly more memory than its 32-bit predecessors in the PowerPC branch of the Power family tree. Various members of IBM's Power chip family appear in everything from low-end communication gear to Sony gaming consoles and high-end IBM Unix servers. HP, which like IBM already sells blades using Intel's 32-bit Xeon, plans to release blades with Intel's 64-bit Itanium in the second half of 2004, said Paul Miller, vice president of marketing for HP's industry standard server group, on Friday. HP doesn't plan to build blades using its own 64-bit processor, the PA-RISC, which it's gradually phasing out in favor of Itanium. Sun Microsystems, in contrast, already sells blades with its 64-bit UltraSparc IIe processor at $1,795 apiece and plans a follow-on using its Gemini processor, scheduled to arrive in 2004. IBM is using price to fight the battle, with lower-end Sun UltraSparc servers the prime target, Benck said. A dual-processor JS20 blade will cost $2,699 with 512MB of memory and $4,017 with 2GB. Its top capacity is 4GB, IBM said. "We're driving a whole new aggressive price point for Power technology into our product line," Benck said. In comparison, the least expensive Power-based server from IBM today is a $5,745 p615 server with a single 1.2GHz Power4+ processor and 1GB of memory. As many as 14 JS20 blades fit side by side in a 12.25-inch-tall BladeCenter chassis. The chassis can also accommodate blades using Intel's Xeon processor and specialized blade modules for networking tasks. The machine won't ship until March 5, IBM said. Earlier this year, IBM said volume shipments would take place in 2003. IBM's JS20 wasn't the only blade to see its schedule slip. IBM had also hoped to introduce a four-Xeon blade this year, but Benck said it's now slated for release in the first quarter of 2004. The four-processor Xeon blades will be twice the thickness of the dual-processor blades, Benck said, meaning that seven will fit into one chassis. Initially the JS20 will be available with Linux from SuSE Linux and Turbolinux, with support from Red Hat Linux to come in the second quarter, and AIX 5L at midyear, Benck said. IBM sells four different server lines--xSeries for Intel-based systems, zSeries for mainframes, iSeries for a family of midrange systems and pSeries for Unix servers. Because the BladeCenter spans two of these lines, pSeries and xSeries, it sports the "eServer" brand. IBM is ambitious and aggressive with its blade plans. In Germany, Big Blue's engineers have been tinkering with zSeries blades using a mainframe's processor and the z/OS operating system. And through a partnership with Intel, IBM hopes to establish its BladeCenter configuration as a standard other server makers will use. A new feature for IBM Unix servers? IBM's decision to sell servers with the PPC 970 also could portend a change for other members of the Power line: chip hardware that can accelerate audio and video. The PPC 970 includes acceleration circuitry called VMX, Benck said, technology that goes by the name of Velocity Engine at Apple and AltiVec at Motorola. "We're absolutely working on a plan for how it might work across the rest of the platforms," Benck said. VMX is an example of "single instruction, multiple data" technology that can speed up some tasks by applying the one command to a large quantity of information instead of having to issue many identical commands. Similar technology exists in Intel's Pentium and Xeon processors. VMX-like technologies are widely used in desktop machines, but the idea came from supercomputing circles and will have applications for servers, said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. In addition to IBM's supercomputing push, VMX technology could speed server tasks such as sending out streams of audio and video and creating detailed digital movie imagery, he said.
2002-04-26 - IBM plots new Unix server chips    IBM will disclose details on Friday of its future server chips, the most important piece of hardware in Big Blue's long battle to dethrone Sun Microsystems from the top of the $21 billion Unix server market. IBM plans to endow its Power5 and Power6 processors with an ability called "Fast Path" to take over tasks that software currently handles more slowly. Power5 will be able to take over software tasks commonly used in the operating system such as packaging data to be sent to networks, said Ravi Arimilli, an IBM Fellow and the chief technology officer for the Power line of chips. Power6 will extend its reach further, taking over tasks now handled by higher-level software such as IBM or Oracle database software or IBM's WebSphere e-commerce software, he said. The Power5 and Power6 processors, to be detailed at IBM's analyst conference in Palisades, N.Y. and expected to arrive in 2004 and 2006, are the successors to the highly regarded Power4 chip at the heart of the p690 "Regatta" Unix servers. IBM hopes the chips will help increase its 20.3 percent share of the Unix server market, second to Sun's 35.2 percent. The technique is sound and likely to be followed by competitors, experts said. "Power4 is the most sophisticated server processor on the market. It looks like they're simply going to be extending their lead," said Peter Glaskowsky, a senior editor for Microprocessor Report, referring to IBM's technical lead. The application acceleration is an innovative answer to the question of what tasks chips should handle as ever-smaller circuitry gives the chips more processing power. IBM launched the Power6 team in December, Arimilli said. "Everything is in the concept phase," with the team currently working on the vision of where Power6 and later Power7 can take IBM in the second half of the decade. Sun, however, called software acceleration unremarkable. "It sounds like what every architect pursues. You try to pick what you want to be really good at and move it into the hardware," said Sue Kunz, director of marketing for Sun's processor group, adding that Sun has had chip-based acceleration multimedia operations such as media streaming for years. Brad Day, an analyst with Giga Information Group, however, sees a nearer-term challenge for IBM, since its Power4 processor still has two years to go. This year, IBM will repackage Power4 into "single-chip modules" for lower-end systems with one to four Power4 processors. "What IBM needs to do is to bring their Power4 architecture down through their product line such that they're competing from a position of lower cost but higher performance," Day said. But Day is impressed with IBM's ability to have multiple product groups work together--in particular, formerly isolated teams from different server hardware and software groups. "You're starting to see these fruits of integrated product development," he said. Walking and chewing gum at the same time Power5, which will be built initially with 130-nanometer (0.13 micron) features, also will feature "simultaneous multithreading," a feature that allows a single chip to act as two. Intel's "hyperthreading" version of this technology adds a modest performance increase--roughly 20 percent or so, depending on what program the chip is running--but Arimilli said Power5's multithreading will allow a single processor to behave like two processors running full throttle. Here, IBM's lead isn't as strong. Not only does Intel have some multithreading abilities today in its Xeon server chip line, but it inherited the team designing the now-cancelled EV8 processor that had very sophisticated multithreading. "That's likely to show up in Itanium," Glaskowsky said, and there are some comparatively simple ways Intel can speed multithreading in its Pentium and Xeon lines. Power4 already has two CPUs (central processing units) on each slice of silicon, with four Power4 processors mounted into a large package called a multichip module with thousands of high-speed wires. With Power4, each module has eight CPUs, but the arrival of simultaneous multithreading will increase that to 16, Arimilli said. Power5 won't be much larger than Power4 in terms of transistor count, Arimilli said. Through minimizing the increases and circuitry, "We're trying to drive the cost way down," he added. IBM gets the simultaneous multithreading abilities not through new circuitry but through a different use of existing "execution units," the part of the chip responsible for digesting and executing instructions. "We didn't grow more units, we just used the existing units more intelligently," Arimilli said. The new chip also has faster communications channels to the chip so it isn't starved of data as well as better sharing of data in high-speed "cache" memory. IBM plans several other features in the chip as well: The system will come with added circuitry not only to detect when errors have occurred transmitting data but also to fix those errors, a feature that historically has been reserved to the domain of mainframes. It's part of IBM's eLiza initiative to make servers self-healing. "With Power4, we detected a lot of errors and recovered on a significant amount of them. With Power5, we detect errors and recover from almost every one. We're now maybe 95 or 97 percent of a mainframe" in terms of chip technology, Arimilli said. Where Power4 was intended for high-end Unix servers, Power5 has a broader mandate, Arimilli said. IBM plans to use it in "blade" servers as well, super-thin servers stacked densely like books in a bookshelf. Glaskowsky said IBM will have to curtail the sizable power consumption and resulting waste heat of Power4 to achieve this target. Power4 produces 125 watts of power, but a blade processor is constrained to about 25 to 40 watts. "Partitioning," the ability to split a single big server into several smaller ones, will improve. Power4 permits a partition that's the size of a single processor, but Power5 will allow hundreds of partitions, Arimilli said. That hardware move will dovetail with coming versions of AIX--5.2 in late 2002 and 5.3 in 2003--that increasingly will let hardware resources be easily reassigned to different partitions, Day said. Fast Path But the Fast Path acceleration feature wins the spotlight, Glaskowsky said. "We've heard nothing from Intel application-specific acceleration features in Itanium, and we can see out into the 2004, 2005 timeframe," Glaskowsky said, adding that Sun can't afford to spend as much on chip design as IBM and Intel and that SGI and Hewlett-Packard Unix chips eventually are being phased out. Arimilli said CPUs tend to spend a large fraction of their time executing a relatively small number of software tasks. It's these tasks the Fast Path acceleration features offload. IBM selected only mature software processes that don't change often so it's not a problem when the operation is hardwired into immutable silicon. "We reached around and tried to find some common things customers do within the operating system that get called frequently," Arimilli said of the feature. The acceleration feature will speed up several communication tasks, including the TCP/IP processing used to read and write data on the Internet and corporate networks. Accelerating TCP/IP makes sense, Glaskowsky said; the software for running a single network connection with a 1 gigabit-per-second transfer capacity soaks up the entire processing power of a processor on an UltraSparc processor in a Sun server, he said. However, other chips can handle the task, and indeed companies such as Alacritech and Adaptec are working on special-purpose chips that do so. Power5 will accelerate other communications processes as well, including the Message Passing Interface (MPI) used to harness clusters of computers into a collective supercomputer, Arimilli said. And the chip will accelerate virtual memory subsystem, a frequently used operating system feature that manages how higher-speed regular memory can be expanded by using slower but bigger hard drives. Sun cautions that there can be problems accelerating software functions. "If all you're going to do is a custom operation, then building a custom chip makes sense. But computers are still in the general-purpose range," Kunz said. And designing the processor poorly--for example, hardwiring specific software operations that aren't used frequently--wastes silicon real estate, making the chip more costly and power-hungry. Glaskowsky said a good chip design could intercept requests to the operating system to handle jobs the chip itself can perform faster, but that automation would be difficult for higher-level software. Arimilli said Power5 and Power6 will be faster for any software, but the acceleration features will require support from software makers. Such support isn't too difficult, Glaskowsky said. Initially, IBM's version of Unix, AIX, will be able to take advantage of the new chip features, Arimilli said. The company also is working with Linux programmers so that Unix variant also can tap into the chip's acceleration resources, he said. "We created these interfaces to the silicon accelerators open so the Linux guys could take advantage of it," Arimilli said.
2003-02-07 - IBM plans top-end 'Armada' Unix server IBM plans to release a new top-end Unix server in 2004, a 64-processor machine code-named Armada that will feature the company's coming Power5 processor, a senior Big Blue executive has confirmed. Armada, the successor to the 32-processor p690 "Regatta" system that IBM introduced more than a year ago, is a Unix server that will come closest so far to matching the capabilities of the company's vaunted mainframe systems. It will take over as the standard-bearer for the company's years-long plan to unseat Sun Microsystems' top ranking in the $21 billion Unix server market. Nick Bowen, vice president of Unix and Intel server software development at IBM, confirmed details of the system in an interview. A new version of AIX, 5.3, will come in early 2004, he said. Armada itself is expected in the first half of 2004. Mammoth servers, while more powerful than what the majority of customers need, are still in demand, said Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice. "Most do not need (72-processor Sun Microsystems) 15Ks or (64-processor Hewlett-Packard) Superdomes, but from a customer-comfort point of view, you have to have a bigger box than customers currently need," Eunice said. Customers often buy a system that has room to expand, and they want to know they can add more processors and memory as their computing needs grow. IBM is making progress against Sun. From 2000 to 2001, the last full year for which statistics are available, Big Blue increased its share 2 percentage points to 20 percent of the $21 billion market, while Sun lost 3 percentage points to 35 percent. Hewlett-Packard remained at No. 2 with 21 percent, according to Gartner. IBM's Armada will use 64 Power5 physical processors, Bowen confirmed, but, by using a design called "simultaneous multithreading," each processor will act in some ways like two separate processors. Simultaneous multithreading is related to Intel's hyper-threading, but while Intel says current hyper-threading gives a chip a modest boost of 20 percent or so, IBM expects simultaneous multithreading will let a single chip do the work of two processors running full-bore. As a result, the 64-processor system will be the equivalent of a 128-processor server, Bowen said. Such mammoth systems are rare. Fujitsu sells one today. HP plans two 128-processor "Pinnacle" systems, one using its PA-RISC chips coming by the end of 2003 and one using Itanium chips coming by the end of 2003 or early 2004. And the big systems are a newer trend at IBM, whose mainframe expertise led its engineers to emphasize a small number of very powerful processors, Eunice said. When they started selling larger multiprocessor systems in 1998 and 1999, though, "They had this coming-to-God experience: 'Wow, people really do want this stuff!'" Eunice said. A key part of Armada's potential will come not through its oodles of chips but through software, Bowen said. Specifically, the system will come with improved "partitioning" abilities, which let a single computer run multiple operating systems simultaneously. Running multiple operating systems at once, something IBM's top-end mainframe line has been adept at for years, is useful for a variety of functions. Servers can be subdivided to run several tasks, which can be less expensive than buying several independent computers. And the sizes of the different partitions can be changed on the fly to adjust to changing workloads. Current IBM Unix servers can run one copy of the operating system per processor. But with AIX, the next incarnation of IBM's version of Unix, each processor will be able to handle as many as 10 operating systems, Bowen said. That narrow slicing is good for running large numbers of less demanding jobs on a machine. Bowen has high hopes for the new version of AIX. "With AIX 5.3, an early 2004 product, we're going to pretty much catch up to the 390," he said, referring to the S/390 mainframe line that now sports the zSeries label. The improvements will help keep AIX ahead of Linux, a rising star that's beginning to encroach on more seasoned Unix products. A key part of IBM's approach to multiple partitions is an idea called virtualization, which shields software from the underlying hardware it's using. This level of abstraction makes it possible in current systems to change processors or memory without shutting down computing operations. AIX 5.3, though, will add a new feature, the virtualization of input-output systems, the last major subsystem. The move will make the machines more flexible to changing computing loads. With virtualized I/O, as many as 256 copies of AIX will be able to share the same network connection, Bowen said. Current systems require a separate network card for each copy of the operating system. "It's very important for IBM to get the virtual I/O story," said Giga Information Group analyst Brad Day. "It's unclear whether HP will be able to match it at the release time," he said, and HP is a leader in many partitioning technologies. Power5 processors will be built on a 130-nanometer manufacturing process, IBM has said. That process is the same used for the current top-end Power4+, which runs at 1.2GHz and 1.45GHz. Day expects that IBM will bring the Power5 processor to midrange and low-end Unix servers in the second half of 2004.
2002-11-27 - IBM plans 2003 muscle servers  IBM is taking the long view for Intel-based servers. The company is poised to release its first "blade" servers and 16-processor Intel-based systems in coming weeks. But right now Big Blue is more focused its Intel products for 2003, according to the head of IBM's Intel server group. Among the parade of Intel server products scheduled for next year are a system with 32 Xeon chips, skinny "blade" servers with four Xeon processors apiece, and a line of Itanium 2 systems that start with four processors and move up to 16, said Susan Whitney, general manager of IBM's xSeries group. The company also plans to release blade servers that commingle the Intel server line with IBM's Unix line by plugging IBM's Power chips into an Intel blade chassis. The new products reflect a change for IBM. The company rose to prominence by selling high-end networked server computers, and for years gave short shrift to models using Intel processors. But in 1998, seeing the steady improvement in and use of Intel chips and Microsoft operating systems, the company concluded it was time to do something about its mediocre Intel server line, then called NetFinity and now called xSeries. The move was accelerated when IBM got the Linux religion in 2000. The first major results of the overhaul plan, known as the X Architecture project, started arriving this year with the x440 server, which comes with eight processors. By late December, a 16-processor version will be generally available, Whitney said. The same EXA chipset that wires together the main processors in the x440 is also used in an Itanium version. The first versions of that system, using four Itanium 2 processors, will be released "beginning early next year," Whitney said. Later in 2003, the system will expand to accommodate 16 Itanium processors. The x440 with Xeon processors also is due for a boost. Whitney said a 32-processor version is slated for release in 2003. IBM earlier had spoken of achieving that 32-processor goal through a successor to EXA called EXA2, but Whitney said the 32-processor system will be made of four eight-processor cabinets joined with high-speed links. The activity at IBM isn't lost on competitors, including Hewlett-Packard, which garners more revenue than any other Intel server seller. Dell Computer's Intel servers have been getting attention for efficiency and price, but HP is more worried about the "sleeping giant," IBM, said Tim Golden, director of marketing for HP's Intel servers. "The reality is that the better competitor is IBM," Golden said in an interview. "They're doing a lot of things right." Slicing the pie Market-share figures released Wednesday by research firm IDC bear out Golden's view of Big Blue. According to the IDC report, HP racked up 32 percent of the $4.3 billion in sales of Intel servers worldwide in the third quarter of 2002. Dell claimed 21 percent and IBM, 17 percent. Growth trends favor IBM and Dell, though, IDC researchers said. IBM's revenue increased 22 percent from the year-ago quarter, Dell's rose 8 percent, but HP's dropped 7 percent. For eight-processor servers, HP was king of the heap in the third quarter a year ago with 50 percent of sales, beating out IBM's 15 percent. In the same quarter this year, IBM had 42 percent and HP 40 percent in the market, valued at $185 million, IDC said. IBM's eight-processor server revenue increased from $28 million in the third quarter of 2001 to $63 million this year. Behind this reversal of fortune, to some extent, were the particulars of new Intel processors. IBM's x440 server was able to use the new-generation Xeon MP, but HP decided to skip that product in its coming "F8" chipset-based servers because the chip's performance in multiprocessor servers didn't meet expectations. Specifically, the first Xeon MP had less high-speed cache memory than its predecessor; IBM compensated with a huge 32MB cache in the x440. HP had said that its F8-based machines were awaiting a new Xeon with 2MB of cache memory. Golden said the servers, code-named Lightning 2, will ship in the first quarter of 2003. The new 2MB cache Xeon MP, code-named Gallatin, is available now. Blades are another area of activity. IBM has shipped 200 blade servers thus far to early customers including AOL Time Warner, which, it said, is using them to run America Online e-mail software. Whitney said its blade servers will be generally available "in a couple of weeks." IBM's first blade systems, named BladeCenter, use dual Xeon processors. Coming in 2003 will be blades with four Xeons, better for higher-powered tasks such as running large Microsoft Exchange e-mail servers. If a customer needs more than a handful of dual-Xeon systems, using a BladeCenter will be less expensive than buying separate rack-mounted servers, Whitney said. The BladeCenter chassis also accommodates blades using IBM's Power processor, and IBM will begin selling that product next year. Individual blades cost $1,879 apiece; the chassis, including a network switch, starts at $2,789. On blades, Linux is a popular operating system, Whitney said, with about half of customers using the Unix clone. "We see Linux as a big driver in the blades," she said. A major perceived barrier to Linux's adoption on high-end servers is its ability to take advantage of all processors in a system. Linux can exploit eight-processor servers today, and in some emerging markets, it's used on those systems. In China, for example, "half of eight-way servers are Linux," Whitney said.
2003-07-30 - IBM Opteron server gets down to work   IBM's newest eServer, an Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron machine, will debut as part of a new computing cluster that will rank among the top ten high-performing computers in the world. Big Blue, which officially launched its Opteron-based eServer 325 on Wednesday, said it would deliver 1,058 copies of the rack-mounted machine to Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology for use in a computing cluster. The cluster will aid in research on subjects such as biology and materials sciences. Each of the 1,058 eServer 325 systems will be fitted with two AMD Opteron model 246 processors. The forthcoming Opteron 246 is a 2GHz version of the chip, designed for single- and dual-processor workstations and servers. The Opteron chip came out in April 2003. The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology will combine the 1,058 IBM Opteron servers with about 520 Intel-built Itanium 2 boxes to create a Linux computing cluster that will be capable of more than 11 teraflops or 11 trillion calculations per second, according to IBM. That level of performance should put the cluster near the beginning of the "Top500 List", a ranking of the 500 highest-performing computers in the world, maintained by researchers at Germany's University of Mannheim and the University of Tennessee. Though faster computers are always being built, the cluster would come in third if were up and running today, IBM said. Supercomputers and computing clusters, which are very similar in purpose, construction and performance, are ranked together on the list. Clusters, which are increasing in popularity, are typically built from off the shelf components; supercomputers use custom parts. Though it is a hybrid of both AMD and Intel chips, the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology cluster represents a vote of confidence for the Opteron. The chip has won several new customers. China's Dawning Information Industry plans to build a 2000-processor, 10-teraflop Opteron supercomputer. Also, Cray Computer will use 10,000 Opterons in a supercomputer dubbed Red Storm, for the U.S. government's Sandia National Laboratories. The computer is expected to yield 40 teraflops when it is completed next year, Cray said. Though Opteron has won large clients for supercomputers and clusters, IBM is the first big-name server vendor to build an Opteron server. The company has said that it chose to use Opteron because certain customers wanted access to the chip. AMD touts the Opteron's flexibility, because the technology behind the chip allows it to run both 64-bit and 32-bit software, the company said. Though IBM has been discussing the eServer 325 since April, it unveiled the name and price for the first time on Wednesday. Customers can now place orders for the machine. Its price starts at $2,919, IBM said. "For those segments that have already embraced AMD, the enthusiasm for Opteron is very, very high," Dave Turek, leader of IBM's new "Deep Computing" team, said in a recent interview. IBM expects the machine to start shipping later this quarter and become available in volume starting in October. In conjunction with server launch, IBM said its DB2 database will run with its Opteron processor-based server. The DB2 Integrated Clustering Environment, which can run as many as 1,000 processors in a cluster of interconnected servers, uses the SuSE or Red Hat versions of Linux.
2004-03-31 - IBM opens up its Power line    NEW YORK--IBM is proposing to take a leaf out of Linux's book and open up the design process for its Power processor. At a Big Blue event in Manhattan on Wednesday, executives said the company plans to offer more information on the architecture of its PowerPC and Power server chips to device makers and software developers. It will also distribute new software design tools, which should help manufacturers add the chips to their machines and encourage partners to custom Power processor-based chips for their devices. "Now, the stage is set for innovation fueled by collaboration and a whole new era of Power," said Nick Donofrio, a senior vice president of technology and manufacturing at IBM. "We will free electronics manufacturers from the limitations of proprietary microprocessor architectures." IBM's future development effort takes cues from that used in the Linux operating system, which is administered by a large community of developers, Donofrio said. However, IBM will still continue to control many of the most important elements of the Power architecture, such as its instruction set, he said. Processor design is typically a solo effort, with a company such as IBM designing and manufacturing its chips and then supplying them to device manufacturers, which work them into their products. Software developers and customers are typically kept on the outside, with little input into the design of the chips. Collaboration, though, has been used to great effect by companies such as ARM, the Cambridge, England-based chip designer, which develops software tools for its chips and helps cell phone manufacturers and others work out how to incorporate the company's designs into their products. IBM believes that taking a more collaborative approach for its Power processor will strengthen its development, as chip technology progresses, and will improve IBM's position in the market, executives said. The effort will involve work on software, on processor design and on design of hardware that uses the chips, ranging from future consumer devices to existing supercomputers. The plans extend recent IBM moves to bolster its Power line-up in the market. For example, it established a foundry program to manufacture chips for its customers and has licensed its PowerPC processor core, a version of the Power architecture, more widely. IBM's Power chips--whose initials stand for "Performance Optimization with Enhanced RISC"--are best known for their roles in servers, in Apple Computer products and even in game consoles such as Nintendo's GameCube. However, they are used in a broad range of devices, which includes Cisco Systems' networking gear. Big Blue said it plans to tap a number of partners in its collaborative development effort. Present at the New York event were chip manufacturer Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing--a longtime IBM chip and technology partner--as well as operating system software companies Wind River and Red Hat. Also on Wednesday, Sony announced that it has licensed the Power architecture for use in system-on-chip processors, which are all-in-one chips that include many of the features needed to run an electronic device. The Japanese company has also been working with IBM on Cell, an upcoming processor for consumer electronics devices that some expect to drive the next PlayStation game console. For its part, Big Blue announced agreements with L-3 Communications, a defense and aerospace electronics maker, and with Global Brands Manufacture, a Chinese electronics maker. The two companies will use IBM Power chips and other technology services. IBM has been working with a broad range of chipmakers, including Chartered, Infineon and Samsung, along with companies such as Apple and Sony. It's likely that those companies will also contribute to the new IBM design effort, IBM executives said. The company's effort to promote Power through more collaboration and to focus on overall system development and performance instead of on clock speed are likely to be seen as positive by the industry, according to Peter Glaskowsky, a technology analyst and the former editor-in-chief of the Microprocessor Report, who attended the event. "This is the first step. We'll have to see where (IBM) goes with it. Many of the details will have to come out over the next several years," Glaskowsky said. However, he added that it was wise of IBM to make the move, because the systems architecture is one reason why chips like Power4 exceed Intel's Itanium. If it chooses, the systems architecture approach could allow IBM to get a bigger foothold in the markets for consumer electronics, for embedded processors and even for PCs, Glaskowsky said. The company faces a number of rival products, such as Intel and ARM processors and the MIPS processor, in those markets. At the Power event, IBM took the opportunity to show off its several more imminent processor designs. It displayed its forthcoming Power5 processor, the successor to its top-of-the-line server processor, the Power4. It also offered a peek at a forthcoming supercomputer. "Power5 will be far more than a speed bump," Donofrio said. "It will have lasting impact. Looking further out, there is Blue Gene, a system that will far and away become the most radical supercomputer in the world." The Blue Gene/L supercomputer, due next year from IBM, will incorporate very large numbers of relatively low-speed, but less power-hungry, processors. A Blue Gene/L concept system with 32 nodes was shown at the New York event. With processors running at only 500MHz, it registered a performance of 128 gigaflops, according to IBM.
2004-06-04 - IBM opens up high-end Windows options  IBM this week relaxed stringent requirements for running the highest-end version of its Windows server software, effectively lowering the overall price 30 percent in some cases and potentially expanding the pool of interested customers. To minimize crashes, Microsoft and server makers have tightly controlled Windows Server 2003 Datacenter Edition, a product geared for critical tasks that run on powerful machines with numerous processors. For example, hardware, software and storage choices were limited to a small number of certified configurations, and a customer had to purchase support services from the server maker. Windows Server 2003 Datacenter Edition is designed for high-end multiprocessor servers running critical tasks. To enable the careful testing of quality and compatibility that's needed to cut down on crashes, Microsoft has permitted the operating system to be used only in conjunction with a short list of certified hardware and software, including network adapters and antivirus programs. In addition, Microsoft has required that customers buy support contracts and that the systems be set up in advance by qualified server makers such as IBM and Unisys. Now those constraints are being lifted, IBM confirmed this week. Among the changes: Customers no longer must buy the support; IBM-certified hardware may be installed, not just the much shorter list of Datacenter-certified hardware; and customers or computer resellers now may build and install Datacenter servers on their own instead of ordering pre-built machines from IBM. "The fact that this is happening suggests there is perhaps some growing demand from customers to get easier and cheaper access to that version of Windows, which at the end of the day can only be seen as a good thing for Microsoft," said Summit Strategies analyst Dwight Davis. "If Microsoft is able to sell more Datacenter editions and increase its presence in the enterprise, that's clearly a core strategic objective." Microsoft has tried for years to spread Windows to high-end servers, a domain in which Unix systems and mainframes have long dominated. Despite Windows reliability and security problems, the balance of power is changing with the gradual maturing of Windows and the increasing horsepower of Intel-based servers. The loosened Datacenter terms fixes a problem: Customers sophisticated enough to run Datacenter servers were the ones who least needed extensive handholding, said Donn Bullock, senior brand manager for IBM's high-end EXA Intel servers. The previous terms quashed customer desires to move from eight-processor systems that Windows' Enterprise Edition can use to 16-processor or larger models that require Datacenter. "The big hurdle is the big price jump going from Enterprise to Datacenter just to get the additional scalability," Bullock said. "They want to scale, but they don't want to be required to purchase the additional services that Microsoft is requiring them to buy." But once support services are dropped, "Today's new Datacenter offering is roughly 30 percent less expensive than it was before," Bullock said. The move brings Datacenter prices nearer to IBM's lower-end sibling, Enterprise Edition, which is limited to eight-processor servers. Microsoft wasn't shy about attaching a high price in 2002: It charged server makers $24,000 for each copy of Datacenter, according to NEC. Microsoft declined to comment for this story. Datacenter runs on several configurations of IBM's x445 server with as many as 32 Xeon processors and its x455 server with as many as 16 Itanium processors. On Tuesday, IBM added Datacenter support for new models using Intel's 2.7GHz and 3.0GHz Xeon processors and 1.4GHz and 1.5GHz Itanium 2 chips. Windows is now reliable on higher-end multiprocessor systems, said Susan Whitney, who runs IBM's xSeries group for Intel-based servers, in an interview. And because Microsoft "substantially changed their pricing dynamics," more customers will get expertise in the area, she added. Microsoft's perpetual foe, Linux, is also making its way into high-end servers. "We see a lot of Linux on eight-ways," Whitney said. "Linux on an eight-way is a nonevent." Bullock said about 15 to 20 percent of IBM's eight-processor server use Linux, typically to run Oracle or DB2 databases and business software such as SAP's products.
2003-11-11 - IBM Itanium servers push higher    IBM announced on Monday its second Itanium server, a more powerful machine that can accommodate as many as 16 of the high-end processors from Intel. The new x455 is a relative of the four-Itanium x450, IBM's first entry into the Itanium market. As expected, IBM said its x455 systems will let customers stack up as many as four 7-inch-thick modules, each with four Itanium 2 processors. The x455 will be generally available Dec. 7, with a starting price of $21,999, according to IBM. It will come with Microsoft Windows or with Linux from Red Hat or SuSE Linux. The machine is a significant IBM endorsement of Intel's Itanium processor family, a 64-bit line intended for high-end computers. The Itanium--which can run software designed for Intel's popular Xeon and Pentium processors only with difficulty--is not yet widely used, but its advocates, most notably Hewlett-Packard, believe this is beginning to change. IBM, however, has shown mixed feelings about Itanium. For example, on the same day it launched its first Itanium server, it trumpeted the speed of servers that use its own Power processor. "They find it politically expedient to offer Itanium-based servers, because they still have to live in the same world as Intel. It's the path of least resistance for them to offer Itanium, even thought they don't push it," Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff said. But the trend is clear: "IBM is, if anything, getting further and further behind Power." Others are more consistently enthusiastic about Itanium servers. Unisys has sold a 16-processor Itanium system, the ES7000/400, for more than a year, and HP just announced eight-processor and 16-processor systems. "All the big (server) vendors are finally acknowledging the trend of the decade is standardization," and the best way to standardize is by using Intel processors, said Mark Feverston, vice president of marketing at Unisys. "The Intel products are going to be the backbone of computing power." IBM and Unisys have fought pricing battles over Xeon servers, but in the Itanium market, Unisys' bigger competition is HP, Feverston said. If the brains of the x455 are the Itanium processors, the spinal cord is a chipset IBM developed, the Enterprise X Architecture. EXA, code-named Summit, first arrived in another incarnation to support Intel's Xeon processors in IBM's 16-processor x440 system. IBM also plans to sell a 32-Xeon x445 as a successor to the x440. However, the company's schedule for that system slipped: Big Blue initially said the machines would ship this year but now says they're due in the first quarter of 2004.
2002-10-03 - IBM Itanium servers coming by early 2003   IBM will debut its first homegrown Itanium 2 servers by the first quarter of 2003, an important step in the long-awaited arrival of the high-end Intel chip family. IBM has some final testing to work on a version of the x440 server that uses four Itanium 2 processors connected with IBM's EXA chipset, said Brian Sanders, director of marketing for IBM's xSeries Intel-based servers. Then, depending on customer demand, IBM will begin making the systems in quantity either in the end of 2002 or early 2003, he said. "We'll be in volume in the first quarter," Sanders said in a Wednesday interview. "We'll initially release it as a four-way. Then in the first or second quarter of next year, we'll take it up to the full capabilities of EXA," an x440 with as many as 16 Itanium 2 processors. The new server, a system with extensive IBM engineering, is an important step in the gradual development of a full suite of hardware and software around Intel's new Itanium processor line. Itanium servers have yet to make much of a mark in the world; market research firm Gartner Dataquest estimates that only 50,000 will be sold in 2004 and 168,000 in 2006, a tiny fraction of the millions of lower-end Intel processors such as Xeon and Pentium. IBM isn't likely to see high-volume sales of Itanium servers any time soon because customers and computer companies aren't yet familiar with the system, said Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice. "It's a demand-side issue at the moment. These things tend to take awhile to ramp," he said. The Itanium family, which arrived years later than Intel had hoped, is designed to take on established high-end processors such as UltraSparc from Sun Microsystems and Power from IBM. But with the Itanium 2 that debuted this year, Intel has started building up a track record of competitive performance scores and high-end server designs. Servers designed to accommodate the Itanium 2 chip also will work with its two sequels, code-named Madison and Montecito and arriving in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Meanwhile, IBM continues to work on another version of the x440 that uses Intel's Xeon MP processor. That product sells today in an eight-processor configuration and will be sold in a 12- or 16-processor configuration later this fall, somewhat later than IBM originally hoped. Intel servers are a relative novelty at IBM, which until the late 1990s favored its higher-end server families. Now, though, IBM has solid Intel servers, Eunice said, though most of the customer interest will be in the EXA servers and in IBM's new thin "blade" servers. IBM is working to bolster other parts of the computing ecosystem that's necessary to get Intel servers to catch on for higher-end tasks such as running business and inventory software from SAP or J.D. Edwards, or data-analysis software from SAS Institute. IBM on Thursday will unveil an expanded partnership with Microsoft and Intel to help customers try out these software packages on x440 systems. The work will take place at an IBM lab in Kirkland, Wash., Sanders said, part of an existing IBM facility where IBM engineers help Microsoft improve its operating system software. About 10 to 12 support staff from the Kirkland center's 130 employees will work at the new office, helping three or four customers at a time try out the x440 servers and Windows, Sanders said. Microsoft and Intel engineers will be on call to help out, he added. IBM doesn't have a comparable facility for helping customers use the Linux operating system, he said. However, the company is helping customers translate and test their software with Linux, and the company has established a center in New York for financial services companies to try out Linux. "Linux on the x440 is very good in the four- to eight-way space," but more work is needed for systems with more processors, he added. IBM also is looking forward to the next version of Windows for servers, called .Net Server 2003. Optimizations in the new version for high-end multiprocessor servers improve performance 15 percent to 30 percent over the current Windows 2000 software, Sanders said.
2002-09-17 - IBM Intel to share blade server designs    IBM and Intel are joining forces in a multiyear project to design new super-slim "blade" servers, the companies plan to announce Tuesday. The companies will meet to decide which models are needed and which company will design each system, said Tim Dougherty, director of blade server strategy at IBM. Both companies will have access to the blade designs that they decide in advance to share. However, each company also is free to design blade systems outside the arrangement that won't be shared. The first system that will fit into the deal will be IBM's BladeCenter systems, which Dougherty said will be announced by the end of September. Blade servers are thin models that squeeze side-by-side into a single enclosure like books in a bookshelf. Hewlett-Packard is the sole mainstream server maker to sell blade systems, but Dell Computer, IBM and Sun Microsystems each have their own designs. Blades have been a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy market for servers, the networked computers that run full time to handle jobs such as managing corporate e-mail or customer accounts. But designing blades involves balancing computing power against the risk of overheating, among other challenges. Where HP's current blades emphasize squeezing lots of low-end Pentium III processors into a small space, many in the industry are shifting their focus to higher-powered machines with dual Xeon processors. The IBM-Intel arrangement will revolve around these higher-end processors, said Phil Brace, marketing director for Intel's Enterprise Products Group. "The initial products are focused on Intel Xeon and Xeon MP," Brace said, referring to his company's midrange processors that work in two- and four-processor servers, respectively. "Itanium 2 solutions are on the horizon as well." It's difficult to squeeze processors into small spaces without overheating the computer, a problem that can cause data corruption and crashes. Putting higher-end processors such as Xeon and Itanium into small cabinets is trickier than cooler chips such as Intel's ultralow-voltage Pentium III chips. IBM sells full-featured servers, along with management software, services and other additions to make the systems useful. Intel, on the other hand, chiefly sells building-block components such as motherboards that other companies can assemble and brand as their own servers. One blade pioneer is RLX Technologies, but the down economy and the loss of Internet enthusiasm that had led to the initial excitement about blades has left it struggling. Delivering Web pages to browsers is one task that's well-suited to low-power blades. RLX, which last month announced an additional $15 million in funding, released its fourth-generation blade product on Monday. The ServerBlade 1200i uses Intel Pentium III processors running at 1.2GHz. However, the faster speed comes with the consequence of lower density. While 24 of the earlier 800MHz 800i blades can fit into a 5.25-inch-tall enclosure, only 12 of the new 1200i fit in, RLX said.
2003-06-23 - IBM Intel chew up supercomputer list   IBM and Intel have edged ahead on a quickly changing list of the 500 fastest supercomputers. Hewlett-Packard leads the herd with 159 systems on the list, which is set to be released Monday, up from 137 six months ago. But IBM has almost caught up to HP by increasing its numbers to 158 from 131. Meanwhile, the number of systems based on Intel processors--mostly Xeons and a handful of Itaniums--increased from 56 to 119. Big Blue continues to lead when it comes to the largest fraction of the total computing horsepower. Of the total ability of 375 trillion calculations per second, or teraflops, IBM machines account for 34 percent. More than a tenth of the total comes from the Japanese Earth Simulator, a behemoth with a 36-teraflop rating. Sun Microsystems, despite a new high-performance computing effort, has only nine systems on the list. The Top500 list is released twice each year by researchers from Germany's University of Mannheim and the University of Tennessee. And although it always changes, the flux in the new list is higher than usual. Turnover is high, for one thing. The lowest-ranked system on the new list has a speed of 245 gigaflops, or billion calculations per second. Six months ago, that was enough performance for a comfortable 285th-place ranking. And there are new varieties of systems arriving, including Cray's new X1, which holds 10 spots starting with No. 112. Making a rare appearance: a Windows-based system, in the form of a cluster of Dell Computer servers with 384 Xeon processors. It was built at the Cornell Theory Center and is ranked No. 50. And turning up at No. 362 is an HP system with 64 of Intel's forthcoming Itanium 2 6M Madison processors running at 1.5GHz. The system has a speed of 335 gigaflops. The No. 8 spot went to an HP system with 1,540 Itanium 2 processors at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. But Xeon processors are the main reason for Intel's climb. The company's jump up the list is largely due to increased performance and lower costs, said Tom Gibbs, director of industry marketing at Intel. The chipmaker worked on keeping prices down to prompt a massive change in the high-performance computing market. "The hypothesis we had three years ago was that by altering the price-performance (ratio) in these machines, we would see a dramatic increase in demand," Gibbs said. "A year ago we had three systems on the list." One trend Gibbs noted is that the number of processors in the Intel systems is declining because of increasing speeds. In the last version of the list, the smallest Intel machine had 128 Xeons. The current one has 92. Also changing are some of the high rankings. Second and third place were occupied by two identical HP systems called ASCI Q at Los Alamos National Laboratory that now have been combined into one with a 14-teraflop speed. The system uses 8,192 Alpha processors. A Linux Networx system with 2,304 Xeon processors at sister lab Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was remeasured at 7.6 teraflops, enough to move it past ASCI White, an IBM machine also at that lab. The list uses the Linpack benchmark test. Although it's a handy test, it's an imperfect measurement of real-world performance in many cases. News.com's Michael Kanellos contributed to this report.
2000-11-16 - IBM gung-ho over Intel's delayed server chip   LAS VEGAS--Servers using Intel's upcoming high-end Itanium chip won't go on sale for months, but already IBM is eagerly anticipating its successor, code-named McKinley. IBM expects to have the first McKinley prototypes early next year, said Tom Bradicich, director of architecture and technology for IBM's xSeries line of Intel servers. Meanwhile, Intel spokeswoman Christine Chartier confirmed Wednesday the company has pushed back the date it expects McKinley servers to appear from the end of 2001 to the first half of 2002. Regardless of the delay, Bradicich remains "enthused about it," he said during an interview at the Comdex computer show here. McKinley has higher performance than Itanium because of architectural changes to the "pipeline" through which data flows and the management of high-speed cache memory, he said. In addition, software written for Itanium will be more developed by the time McKinley arrives. The chip will also run at a faster clock speed. The McKinley chip is the second in Intel's IA-64 family, an ambitious product line of 64-bit chips developed in partnership with Hewlett-Packard. Intel hopes to use the chip as a weapon against Sun Microsystems and other companies with 64-bit CPUs. Using 64-bit designs is of interest to server makers chiefly because it allows vast databases to be stored entirely in memory, a necessity for large corporations. Another key milestone for McKinley will be "tapeout," the time when the first design is finalized and sent to the factory for the first prototype to be manufactured. A source familiar with Intel's plans said McKinley hasn't yet taped out but is expected to by the end of this year. It appears likely that the Itanium name will apply to more than just the first generation of the IA-64 processor series. Intel no longer uses the IA-64 label, instead using the phrase "Itanium processor family"--indicating that the Itanium name could apply to successors the way that the Pentium lineage was extended with the Pentium Pro, II, III and 4. Chartier declined to comment on the company's branding strategies. Intel has had trouble with Itanium, initially expected in the 1990s and most recently delayed in July until the first half of 2001, while "pilot systems" would arrive in 2000. McKinley suffered the same fate, with the chip's expected arrival at the end of 2001 being demoted merely to the time pilot systems will debut. The delays are a problem for Intel. The longer the delay, the better the chance that competing high-end server chips will be able to proliferate across the Internet infrastructure and that software companies will fall in line with Intel competitors. Intel has also changed its technique for unveiling chips. Instead of announcing the new processor along with its price and a host of systems from the likes of Compaq Computer and Dell Computer, Intel will announce chip details months before systems arrive, Chartier said. As previously reported, IBM is working on a chipset code-named Summit that will allow four-processor groups to be piled into a server with a total capacity of 16 CPUs. Summit will work with both McKinley and a 32-bit Intel server code-named Foster, the upcoming high-end server version of the Pentium 4. Foster is scheduled to debut in the second quarter of 2001, Bradicich said. The Summit chipset will offer high-end memory features, including "mirrored memory," or two banks of identical memory running side by side in case one experiences a fault. In addition, the chipset will include error-correcting code (ECC) for minimizing memory corruption and chipkill memory that works even when a memory module has failed. Hot-swap memory on the chipset also lets administrators replace faulty modules without shutting the system off. Summit will enable "remote input/output" (RIO), which lets CPUs be separated from communications tasks such as connections to the network or storage systems. IBM's competitors aren't standing idly by. Today, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq both resell the Unisys-designed ES7000 server that can accommodate as many as 32 Intel 32-bit CPUs. And in the future, Compaq will sell a server that can hold as many as eight Foster CPUs. In early 2002, the company will begin selling a system that accommodates 16 or 32 64-bit CPUs, Compaq executives have said. HP isn't working on a chipset for high-end 32-bit Intel servers but is for 64-bit machines, Webb McKinney, head of HP's corporate Intel computer line, said in an interview Tuesday.
2004-04-08 - IBM gives rebates on server packages   IBM began offering rebates of $15,000 to $110,000 on Thursday to customers who buy high-end Unix servers packaged with certain products from its software partners. Under the offer, the smallest rebate is for a p670 with eight processors, and the largest for a 32-processor p690, which is the most powerful Unix server sold by Big Blue. The pSeries models, which typically use IBM's AIX version of the Unix operating system but now can also run Linux, cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The rebate applies when a server is bought alongside software from Oracle, SAP, Siebel Systems, Ariba, i2, Retek, PeopleSoft, Manugistics, Lawson, SAAS and others. However, only Oracle's business software is eligible, and not its database products, which compete with IBM's DB2. To qualify, customers must buy the hardware by June 30 and the software within 90 days of the server purchase. IBM is battling leader Sun Microsystems and second-place Hewlett-Packard for a greater share of the Unix server market. It's also trying to advance the cause of the Power processor used by its Unix servers, a move that challenges Intel's Itanium processor. In another promotion launched on Thursday, Big Blue is offering rebates of between $2,000 and $10,000 to companies that buy Linux on the p670, p690 and the eight-processor p650 through Sept. 9. The discount applies to customers who buy a system with a Red Hat or Novell version of Linux. IBM has begun aggressively pushing Linux on the pSeries machines. It follows Big Blue's shift this year for its Linux work on Power processors from a subsidized project to a business with its own profit-and-loss accountability.
2003-08-18 - IBM gets server act together   IBM has largely been able to contain its biggest problem in the server market: itself. For a decade, IBM's server group was losing ground to competitors because of a fragmented product line, political infighting, an inability to adopt technology quickly and a haughty attitude toward customers. Now the tables have turned. Over the past few years, the company has revamped its server lines so that they share components and software, reorganized itself and become more willing to adopt technologies invented outside its walls, such as Linux. As a result, IBM is extending its lead in servers over competitors and is enacting its "sell our stuff with our stuff," or SOSWOS, strategy for boosting service contracts and other sales through other product lines. "The best thing that happened (to IBM's server group) was they got their butts kicked in the early 1990s," said Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice, who thinks the troubles of the last decade triggered the best server work to come out of Big Blue in 40 years. "I've never seen IBM more attuned to product innovation." Much of the credit, analysts agree, goes to William M. Zeitler, the senior vice president whose polished speech and carefully coiffed hair belie a willingness to break with decades-old traditions and impose drastic change in IBM's Systems Group. "He's one of those guys who looks like he'd be profoundly uncomfortable without a suit and tie on. He looks like a conventional IBM guy, but he's not bound by conventional thinking," Sageza Group analyst Charles King said. Even IBM's major competitors recognize the new reality--though that's not to say anyone has thrown in the towel. "To their credit, they are executing well right now. You have to acknowledge that," said Mark Hudson, vice president of marketing, for Hewlett-Packard's Enterprise Storage and Server group. Zeitler has opted for pragmatism over tradition. IBM was divided internally over the idea of mating one of the newest forces of the computing industry, the Linux operating system, with one of IBM's oldest product lines, the zSeries mainframe, Zeitler said. Some in the company feared that support for an operating system that can be obtained at no cost would erode the famously thick software profit margins on mainframes. But Linux won out. "If we weren't aggressive, somebody else would come in and do it," Zeitler said. "We're trying to get in front of the next big thing rather than trying to defend the last great thing." Zeitler has won over some skeptics. "He's got that server group humming on all 12 cylinders," Robert Frances Group analyst Ed Broderick said. Servers, networked computers that process and store data, range from beefed-up PCs that cost a few hundred dollars to superreliable systems that cost millions of dollars and can respond to the needs of thousands of users. Servers handle everything from making plane reservations to delivering e-mail. From 2001 to 2002, IBM extended its server market share lead 2.1 percentage points to 31.1 percent of the $43 billion server market, according to Gartner. No. 2 HP had 25.2 percent, Sun Microsystems 15.1 percent and Dell 7.5 percent. IBM and Dell were the only companies among the four dominant server makers to increase their share. IBM was left behind by Sun in the 1990s, when Internet companies and others were buying servers like mad, but Zeitler believes that the darker economic times that followed play into IBM's hands. "We've hit the bottom of this, and we'll start moving again," he said. "The leaders are going to be different than the leaders going into this. On the last seven economic downturns, IBM gained share." Harmonic convergence Perhaps the biggest technical challenge for IBM's server group, and one of the biggest reasons for the reversal, has been the technological convergence of its four server lines, a process begun before Zeitler took over the server group in 2000 but whose delivery Zeitler must direct. In the past, each server line had its own operating system, software and often a distinct processor. Now, Linux and Java span all four lines, masking some underlying differences between server lines that can trip up programmers. Hardware design ideas straddle borders. The pSeries Unix servers and its iSeries midrange servers, for instance, use nearly identical hardware, with the Power4 processor at their core. IBM has brought high-end multiprocessor capabilities to its xSeries servers based on Intel processors. Technology from the top-end zSeries line for running multiple operating systems independently on the same computer have been moved to the pSeries, iSeries and xSeries. "Dual-core" technology for etching two processors onto a single slice of silicon began with the pSeries but now has been arrived in the latest zSeries model. And now Linux and Java span all four lines. Convergence will continue. Next year's Power5 processor will arrive within a few months in three separate "Squadron" systems--not just 64-processor iSeries and pSeries machines but also a new storage system that, unlike the current Enterprise Storage Server "Shark" line, won't lag the pSeries processor technology by six quarters, Zeitler said. In addition, revamped "Hypervisor" software that underlies all the new Power systems will allow a three-way split personality in a single server, letting Linux run alongside both the AIX operating system for pSeries and the OS/400 operating system for iSeries, Zeitler said. IBM's BladeCenter is convergence incarnate--a chassis that currently can be stuffed with as many as 14 thin dual-processor Intel "blade" servers. IBM has committed to selling Power blades that will fit into the same chassis early in 2004, but Mark Shearer, leader of IBM's Integrated Product Management Team, revealed that IBM is tinkering with a blade that has a mainframe's processor and a z/OS operating system. "At our lab in Germany, we are looking at a mainframe blade. The vision is running z/OS on a blade that goes into the BladeCenter that coexists with Intel and Power," Shearer said, cautioning that the technology is just an experiment, at least at this stage. Variety is also present. IBM is the only major manufacturer to offer in its lineup homegrown chips, Intel processors and Opteron chips from Advanced Micro Devices. Limits on convergence Ultimately, some server technology will likely seep upward to the mainframe line. IBM engineering teams that are designing the mainframe and Power processors have been working closely together, and some believe that IBM ultimately will bring some variant of the Power processor, or at least its design concepts, from the Power line into the mainframe. Such a change isn't unprecedented--IBM moved the Power processor into the iSeries line without disrupting the software that's designed for earlier processors. But Shearer says mainframe processors need different abilities from those of less powerful machines. "For the foreseeable future, there's a very defined mainframe marketplace requiring a different type of processor," he said. Competitors, though, assert that IBM's server lines are still sprawling. "I believe their direction on servers is getting more confusing," HP's Hudson said. For 64-bit processors--those that can handle large databases and other high-end server tasks--IBM sells servers with its Power and mainframe processors, while this year it added Opteron and Intel's Itanium. HP, by contrast, is gradually phasing out its own PA-RISC and Alpha 64-bit chip lines, replacing them with Itanium in coming years. And Sun, while accepting Intel servers into the low end of its product line, still considers its 64-bit UltraSparc processors the mainstay of its business. Sharing technology has helped IBM avoid turf battles inside the company, a not uncommon event given the overlapping products. For instance, when the company began a Unix server line in the 1980s, it put the line under the auspices of the Advanced Workstation Division to avoid the appearance that the machines competed with the midrange iSeries line, then called AS/400, said Jim McGaughan, director of IBM's server strategy and one of the founding members of the company's Unix server group. "We were the people who wore the cloves of garlic around our necks," McGaughan said. Differences have been muted now. IBM has named "eServer sales managers" to make sure that customers don't get competing offers from different IBM server groups. "People no longer say, 'You're infringing on my little kingdom.'" The lesson of lock-in IBM argues that its diverse line is the result of customer demand, and listening to customers has been instructive for Big Blue--in particular, when the customers were displeased. Some remained alienated for years by the company's "account control" practice of introducing its own version of new technologies to lock existing customers onto its hardware and software. "If there were three standards, IBM would invent a fourth," Eunice said. "Lock-in used to be the IBM battle cry," added Broderick, who believes that IBM has abandoned the practice. "Lock-in is probably a passe phrase these days, much to the vendors' disappointment. I think IBM has pretty much given up on the idea of leading people by the nose." Zeitler admitted that the lock-in mentality led to a "valley of darkness for the last 15 years" but argues that IBM has reformed itself. "We have a religious commitment to open standards. Customers are too sophisticated to let themselves get sucked into what people call control points." Sun, though, is quick to pounce on the issue, arguing that IBM has merely moved its lock-in strategy to its services group, which can run customers' computing operations. "They lock you at the business relationship level, which is even worse than the technology lock-up," Sun said in a statement. "A company that outsources to IBM Global Services loses all its information technology know-how seven years down the road." IBM, first punished by customers' departure because of lock-in, now is being rewarded for being open. "When they are open, they've been successful," Eunice said, pointing to IBM's WebSphere software for running Java software on servers, its embrace of Linux and its support of the open-source Eclipse programming tools. Openness also shields IBM to some degree from another issue in the industry: fears about Microsoft's growing influence. "Customers have seen this movie before, and they don't like its ending," Zeitler said. "In spite of the biggest downturn in history, the price of software has gone up," he said of Microsoft's products. One server company whose future is tightly wedded to the fortunes of Microsoft and Intel is Dell, which relies on the research of those allies to enable it to keep its expenses low. According to Gartner, for each of the last 22 quarters, Dell has increased the number of servers shipped compared to the year before by more than 10 percent, Dell spokesman Liem Nguyen boasted. "We have helped to drive down costs and raise the bar on performance by bringing relevant technology to the market at a low cost," he said. Zeitler looks at Dell almost as an ally, because it keeps the pressure on HP and Sun. "Dell has a superior set of logistics and execution capabilities," he said. "HP and Sun are being strategically squeezed."
2001-08-28 - IBM finds new backing for Linux    Updating the love it has for Linux, IBM will argue Tuesday that the relatively new operating system has begun fulfilling its potential as mainstream customers build serious servers with it. IBM, which has pledged to spend $1 billion on the Unix clone this year, will announce several new Linux-using customers at a news conference at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, said Ross Mauri, vice president of development in IBM's server group. In addition, Big Blue will announce that its Websphere e-commerce software now works on a mainframe running Linux. "Linux is no longer on the edge. It is moving into the mainline," Mauri said. Among the new customers is Securities Industry Automation, which is using Linux on an IBM mainframe to run accounting software that lets stock brokers check that buy and sell orders on the New York and American stock exchanges really took place. The system, which went into use a month ago, formerly ran on servers from IBM rival Sun Microsystems. Linux also will house the Web site of the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament, following similar moves by the Professional Golf Association, the National Hockey League and the Wimbledon tennis organizers. In the next seven to eight years, Linux will largely replace Unix, Aberdeen analyst Bill Claybrook said in a July report. Linux will be one of three primary operating systems in commercial use, along with IBM's z/OS mainframe operating system and Microsoft's Windows, he predicted. But the popularity of Linux hasn't led to financial success for Linux companies thus far, many of which have had to lay off staff and several of which have closed altogether. Red Hat remains the strongest Linux company, but it's diversifying into e-commerce software. Large computing companies such as Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Oracle, Intel and SAP are driving the continued development of Linux. Meanwhile, Turbolinux, a Linux seller that got its start in Asia but has been struggling with a canceled initial public offering and management changes, plans to announce a joint venture with Samsung SDS in Korea, Turbolinux said. Samsung SDS is a 6,000-employee company that sells computers with software tuned to customer needs. The joint venture, Turbolinux Systems, will serve customers in Korea, Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, Turbolinux said. And Caldera International, which sells Unix as well as Linux, announced it's working with Intel to improve the GDB debugging tool. The work will make it easier to find out what's wrong with programs written in the Fortran language for Intel's 32-bit chips such as Pentium and Xeon as well as for Intel's 64-bit Itanium chips.
2005-02-23 - IBM extends lead in server market  IBM continued to march ahead of rivals in 2004 in server sales, a key market in the computing industry, making gains in models using x86 chips and the Unix operating system. Big Blue's server revenue increased 9.3 percent to $16.1 billion from 2003 to 2004, according to figures released Wednesday by research firm Gartner. That growth outpaced the overall market, which grew 7.2 percent to $49.5 billion. Dell grew faster, increasing revenue 20 percent to $4.8 billion. That wasn't enough to pass No. 2 Hewlett-Packard, which grew 6.7 percent to $13.4 billion, or No. 3 Sun Microsystems, which shrank 4 percent to $5.2 billion. Servers are powerful networked machines that handle tasks such as storing e-mail, hosting Web sites, making airline seat reservations or recording bank transactions. Comprising a strategically significant market in the computing industry, servers are at the heart of customers' businesses, come with plumper profit margins than many other products and influence purchases of other computing equipment. IBM has been tops in the market for years. It fended off an attack by Sun, which soared in the late 1990s but fell back afterward. Big Blue is now targeting Dell with higher-end x86 servers and HP's Itanium-based products with its Power5 processors. "IBM was able to take advantage of the Power5 servers in upgrading its current installed base as well as upselling current (Intel server) users," Gartner analyst Mike McLaughlin said. IBM showed gains in the Unix server market, which overall declined 2.8 percent to $16.2 billion in 2004. IBM's share increased from 24.3 percent to 26.7 percent at a time when Sun dropped from 32.6 percent to 31.8 percent and HP dropped from 31.9 percent to 30.2 percent. HP has suffered in Unix as it transfers its systems from its own PA-RISC processor to Intel's Itanium. "The increase of Itanium has not outpaced the decline of PA-RISC," McLaughlin said. In contrast, dramatic growth took place with servers using x86 processors such as Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron, a market that boomed 16.4 percent to $23.2 billion. HP kept its top ranking with 32.6 percent, but its 14.1 percent growth rate lagged the market. In contrast, No. 2 Dell grew 19.6 percent to capture 20.5 percent of the market and No. 3 IBM grew 22.4 percent for 18 percent of the market, Gartner said. Dell's gains came chiefly in single-processor and dual-processor models. In contrast, revenue from its four-processor models shrank 3 percent to $633 million, McLaughlin said. IBM also led two segments of the server market that grew much faster than the overall market did. Servers running the Linux operating system grew 50.9 percent to $4.9 billion, while blade servers, thin models that slip side by side into a shared chassis, grew 123 percent to $1.21 billion, Gartner said. In blades, IBM's revenue grew 316 percent to $518 million; HP's grew 78 percent to $437 million; Sun's grew 76 percent to $115 million; and Dell's shrank 48 percent to $33 million. In Linux, IBM grew 48 percent to $1.5 billion; HP grew 36 percent to $1.25 billion; and Dell grew 44 percent to $748 million. Sun has launched an effort to spread its Solaris version of the Unix operating system to x86 chips--chiefly AMD's Opteron. The company made some headway with that effort, though it's still a tiny sliver of the overall x86 market, with revenue increasing 299 percent to $59 million. However, even though Sun promotes Solaris at the expense of Linux, the latter fared better at Sun, with 93 percent growth to $59 million. AMD pioneered the addition of 64-bit extensions to x86 in 2003 with its Opteron. Intel followed suit halfway through 2004. Despite AMD's earlier arrival, more revenue came from servers using Intel's 64-bit Xeon chips, McLaughlin said: $1.3 billion for Xeon servers, compared with $838 million for Opteron servers. Intel could make more gains soon. In coming months, it plans to release new 64-bit Xeon processors, code-named Cranford and Potomac. These are suitable for four-processor servers, an area where Opteron is already available.
2004-02-24 - IBM expands Linux push on servers  IBM on Tuesday announced an expansion of its sales of Linux on server hardware. The company said it is now selling Linux on its entire pSeries line of Unix servers, has cut the product line's prices, and is bringing faster 1.9GHz Power4+ chips to the top-end p690 model. Get Up to Speed on... Open source Get the latest headlines andcompany-specific news in ourexpanded GUTS section. Until now, Big Blue has offered Linux only on a handful of lower-end pSeries machines, which more often run IBM's version of Unix, called AIX. Now IBM will sell SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 8 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3 on all the pSeries systems, the company said. IBM arranges for the Linux companies themselves to deliver the software to customers. Linux runs on many different processors, including Intel's Itanium and Hitachi's SH, but it's most widely used on Intel-compatible x86 chips such as Pentium and Xeon. IBM is trying hard to spread Linux to its Power-based servers, a company initiative that now has its own profit and loss accounting. Price cuts range for the previous top-end machine with a 1.7GHz Power4+ range from 12 percent to 15 percent, according to IBM. Prices for the p690 with 1.5GHz processors were cut, 12 percent to 16 percent, and prices for the 16-processor p670 with 1.5GHz processors were cut 9 percent to 14 percent. The latest p690 system also can accommodate twice as much memory--as much as 1 terabyte, roughly 4,000 times the amount in a typical PC. The moves come in the midst of a highly competitive Unix server market in which IBM has been gradually gaining share at the expense of No. 1 Sun Microsystems and No. 2 Hewlett-Packard. Sun and HP have just introduced new top-end servers, though: the Sun Fire E25K using Sun's UltraSparc IV chips and the SuperDome using HP's PA-8800. IBM's p690 recently returned to the top spot in a server speed test for keeping track of simulated inventory transactions. HP Superdomes using Intel's Itanium processor have led the list for most of the last year, and Intel's head of server processors, Mike Fister, said last week that he expects an Intel-based system will reclaim the lead soon.
2002-07-29 - IBM expands deal to boost servers  IBM has expanded a deal with VMware, a company whose software lets servers act bigger than they are. VMware's software lets a single Intel server run several operating systems simultaneously, similar to features in IBM's higher-end Unix and mainframe servers and useful for consolidating work onto fewer machines. IBM and VMware began working together earlier this year, but now IBM will sell VMware's top-end ESX version on its servers and through its Global Services division, the companies said Monday. The move underscores the steady growth in power of Intel servers. These machines--which accounted for the vast majority of one- and two-processor servers sold last year--are increasingly competitive with the specially designed RISC/Unix servers from Sun Microsystems, HP and IBM that need their own chips and operating systems. Also on Monday, IBM announced performance scores using the TPC-C benchmark test for its new eight-processor x440 "Vigil" servers. The IBM score of 92,000 beat eight-processor designs from Hewlett-Packard and Dell that used an earlier Intel Xeon chip, with respective scores of 69,000 and 57,000. The benchmark, one of the key ones for servers, measures how many transactions the server can perform per minute. HP has been bickering with IBM over performance scores for Intel servers using Intel's latest-generation Xeon MP chip, which HP said wasn't fast enough. And Dell rejected a deal to use IBM's x440 technology in its own servers. HP is the major server company pushing Intel's higher-end Itanium processor, and now some of the comparisons with the Xeon line are becoming possible. HP's rx5670 server, with four Itanium 2 processors, posted a TPC-C score of 78,000, not far from the 92,000 IBM score for x440 with eight Xeon processors. IBM's x440, one of the first IBM Intel servers to include major design elements from Big Blue itself, is the flagship of the company's effort to wrestle some market share away from No. 1 HP and No. 2 Dell--and the effort is showing some success. The x440 "performed well" in the second quarter, helping IBM increase its Intel server shipments, market share analysis firm Gartner said Monday.
2002-12-04 - IBM debuts new Linux-only server   IBM will announce a new low-end server Wednesday, its first Power processor-based system that can run the Linux operating system without needing IBM's AIX as well. IBM's pSeries machines already are available with Linux but have also required AIX, IBM's version of Unix. Now, as expected, Big Blue has modified Linux sufficiently that its p630 servers will start up without AIX. The p630 is the lowest-end product to use IBM's 64-bit Power4 processor, and Big Blue is positioning the product as a lower-cost Linux alternative to Hewlett-Packard's Itanium-based offerings. Itanium, like Power4 and Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc, is a 64-bit processor that can communicate with much larger amounts of memory. IBM acknowledges there isn't much of a market yet for Linux on the pSeries machines, but it hopes experimental customers such as those needing to perform scientific calculations will gravitate toward the new p630 systems. A single-processor p630 costs $15,477 with 2GB of memory; adding SuSE's version of Linux tacks on about $1,250. The same system with AIX costs $16,977 but has flexible configuration options the Linux system lacks. IBM is taking advantage of Linux's ability to run on numerous processors, moving it to all four of its major server lines. "IBM has pursued a path of viewing Linux as a high-tech Esperanto," a language that will bring some unity to its disparate products, said Sageza Group analyst Charles King. But it's not easy to run Linux outside its mainstream base of computers using Intel Pentium and Xeon processors. IBM is carrying much of the load in making sure software is available for the pSeries systems--not just Linux itself but also programming tools, Java software and its DB2 database. Some software partners are coming aboard, though. Red Hat, the No. 1 seller of Linux, has agreed to release a version of its high-end Advanced Server product for all four IBM server lines. While Linux boots on several Power-based systems, this is the first time IBM has offered the Linux-only option as a product, the company said.
2004-09-29 - IBM claims fastest supercomputer title--for now    IBM claimed first place Wednesday in a supercomputer speed competition with an expanded version of its Blue Gene/L, which beat out a Japanese machine from NEC. But a new Silicon Graphics machine has a chance at giving Big Blue a run for the title. Researchers at the Blue Gene/L production facility in Rochester, Minn., clocked the machine at a sustained performance of 36.01 trillion calculations per second, or 36.01 teraflops. By comparison, since 2002, NEC's Earth Simulator has held the top spot on a ranking of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers while running at a speed of 35.9 teraflops. "The U.S. supercomputing industry is still alive and well," Dave Turek, vice president of Deep Computing at IBM, said during a conference call Wednesday. IBM is building the Blue Gene/L for nuclear weapons lab Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory but has begun selling the system to other customers. IBM's achievement was expected. When two Blue Gene/L machines made it into the Top500 list, Turek said there was a "good chance" Blue Gene/L would top the forthcoming November list, adding that "the trajectory of it is already clear." There's a new contender on the horizon, though, a NASA system called Columbia that SGI is building with 10,240 Intel Itanium processors. Intel President Paul Otellini said in September the system will be finished in 2004 and will have a speed of 60 teraflops. Another contender for a high rank is a system at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, which hit the No. 3 spot in 2003 using 1,100 Apple G5 computers, each with dual 2GHz processors. An upgrade with the same number of slimmer Apple Xserve computers is now complete, said Virginia Tech spokeswoman Lynn Nystrom. "The goal will be to remain in the top 10 (of the Top500) and the fastest at a university," Nystrom said. Although Apple sells Xserves only with 2GHz processors today, the Virginia Tech upgrade uses 2.3GHz chips, she said. The flagship Blue Gene/L machine at Livermore isn't going to make its initial 2004 deadline, though. "The total delivery to Livermore will come roughly in May of 2005. One of the challenges to face any company when going down the path of building scalable systems is that you really do penetrate certain unknown areas," Turek said. Although the 64-rack Blue Gene/L that IBM is building for the Livermore lab is the largest, the company also has sold a six-rack system to the Astron Dutch radio telescope project, a one-rack system to Argonne National Laboratory and a four-rack system to Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. Don Dossa, a computational physicist at the Livermore lab, said in an earlier interview that Blue Gene/L is well adapted for some calculations but not for others. For example, it's appropriate for simulating materials in a relatively unchanging environment, such as a solid that's cracking under pressure. But when it comes to the nuclear weapons simulations at the heart of the lab's mission, the 512MB of memory in each Blue Gene/L computing node isn't enough to deal with the broad range of radiation, temperature and pressure conditions, Dossa said. For those nuclear weapons simulations, IBM is building a system called ASCI Purple that uses a smaller number of more powerful computers that rely on IBM's Power5 processor. Blue Gene/L, when finished, will have about 65,000 dual-core processors.
2003-05-14 - IBM CEO Replacement cycle a dinosaur   The technology replacement cycle--the frenzied buying spree that the tech industry has come to count on every few years--is being driven to the tar pits by on-demand computing, said IBM CEO Sam Palmisano. Speaking at a meeting with security analysts in Boston, Palmisano postulated that large corporate customers are no longer interested in investing in PCs or the latest servers. Instead, these companies want to obtain software, consulting services and back-end hardware in a holistic manner to help them automate business processes and make their overall operations more efficient--the very activity that the Armonk, N.Y.-based giant has been promoting. "It has been product-centric, gizmo-driven growth, but that is not going to happen again," Palmisano said. "This industry continues to be a growth industry, because it solves a very important problem: productivity." Additionally, he said, large companies are once again funding internal technology projects. "We really do see more (funding) now than a year ago, now that projects are going forward. Things have stabilized," he said. Since taking over IBM last year, Palmisano has promoted a strategy called on-demand computing, under which large companies will provide encompassing solutions to existing business problems through technology. How these solutions are implemented, he said, varies by the customer and industry in question; some corporations are looking for complete technological retrofits, while others will merely want to rent extra computing capacity for peak periods. As a consequence of these trends, consulting and software for weaving together these organic systems will become a larger part of the profit pool in the industry. By 2005, these categories will account for 65 percent of the technology industry's profits, up from 46 percent today. Servers, storage systems, PCs and components, meanwhile, will decline from 54 percent of the profit pool to 35 percent. Palmisano said that IBM is one of a very few companies that can provide all of those pieces. It has an extensive services and consulting group, participates in all of the relevant product markets, and can boast more depth in its research department than almost anyone else, he said. Research, he said, "is why we are gaining all the share. It shows up in our servers. It shows up in our software. It shows up in our storage systems." IBM has set up 17 separate practice groups to focus on solving business problems with technology in different industries. The life sciences group, for instance, focuses on using technology to make drug research more efficient. The group has gone from "zero to a half billion dollars," Palmisano said. "The more business process insight we can bring to a problem, the more margin opportunity we have," he said. Some hurdles ahead Nonetheless, he acknowledged that all is not sunny in the services-centric future. In recent months, IBM has had to renegotiate consulting and services contracts, reducing the overall value of the deals. The company has also found itself saddled with excess capacity in services. Furthermore, companies are not fully funding multiyear, major technology projects in the same manner that they used to. Rather than commit to a complete budget up-front, companies will fund a project for six months and, if it goes satisfactorily, fund another six months of work. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. IBM, Palmisano added, won't be getting out of the PC or chip business anytime soon, something some analysts have recommended for years. Large customers still need PCs, he pointed out. The company's PC and Intel-based server operations, moreover, are crucial laboratories for learning how to remove costs out of other operations. Likewise, the microelectronics business is necessary to enhance the services and storage business. "We are in the business fundamentally to provide differentiation to our storage and server business," he said. IBM will not become a large-scale foundry and manufacture chips for a wide variety of customers, Palmisano said. However, it will sign chip development deals with a dozen or so companies such as Sony that will use IBM's chip facilities. "We are not going to become the next TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.). We are not going to become the next foundry or the next Intel," the CEO said. In contrast to his predecessor, the often opaque Lou Gerstner, the jocular Palmisano took the opportunity to throw a few jabs at competitors, although largely anonymously. After Hewlett-Packard acquired Compaq Computer, the combined company became for a time the largest overall server company. "We had the opportunity to buy a PC company in the past," but chose not to, he said. People crowed that the combined company would be No. 1 in the server market, he said. "They were No. 1 for about four weeks. We're back to being No. 1." Without naming Intel, he noted that a large semiconductor company recently announced that its top-end chip contained a flaw and could not be run at 1GHz, a problem that Intel noted with its Itanium chip. "We've got three times the performance at 70 percent of the cost," Palmisano said. IBM is No. 2 in storage, according to market research surveys, but next year the company should be No. 1, he predicted, a swipe at rival EMC. And, as a veiled message to Microsoft, Palmisano touted corporate leaders' embrace of Linux, the open-source operating system. It's one of the topics that comes up most frequently in meetings, he said. "When CEOs are talking about Linux, the world has changed," he said.
2006-02-08 - IBM bringing gaming chip to blade servers  IBM introduced its overhauled blade server line on Wednesday, upgrading its core components and touting forthcoming options based on Xeon, PowerPC and Cell chips at the same time. The revamp begins with a new chassis, BladeCenter H, and a higher-end PowerPC-based server, both due in March. Next-in-line machines will get a new slant from Intel's low-power Xeon and IBM's own unusual Cell processor. The moves, all first reported by CNET News.com, are designed to keep IBM's BladeCenter chassis in the No. 1 spot in the fast-growing market. In the third quarter of 2005, IBM garnered 42 percent of blade server revenue, with Hewlett-Packard second at 32 percent, and Dell in third with 9 percent, IDC said. Blades are thin servers that plug side-by-side into a chassis. The chassis supplies shared resources such as electrical power and networking switches. The approach is designed to be more flexible than conventional stand-alone rack-mounted servers. IBM's new 15.75-inch-tall BladeCenter H chassis is 3.5 inches taller than its predecessor. However, the design increases internal data transfer capacity tenfold to 40 gigabits per second; adds faster InfiniBand and Ethernet networking options; and includes more sophisticated self-management features. The system still accommodates as many as 14 blade servers, Big Blue said. The base price for an empty chassis is $3,849, though it increases dramatically with the addition of blades. For example, adding seven dual-processor Xeon blades, each with 4GB of memory, a backup power supply, and dual Ethernet switches, brings the list price to just under $50,000. The BladeCenter H price is ostensibly $1,000 higher than for the older BladeCenter, but in fact the difference likely will be greater: IBM on Tuesday launched a promotion through March 31 that cuts the price of earlier machines by as much as 50 percent. A more radical departure for IBM than the design upgrade is its plan to begin selling blades using its Cell Broadband Engine processor. Those machines will arrive in the third quarter, the Armonk, N.Y.-based company said. IBM's Cell processor was codeveloped with Toshiba and Sony, which will use in it in its upcoming PlayStation 3 console. It has a PowerPC 970 processing core supplemented by eight special-purpose engines for handling graphics or numeric calculations. Each Cell blade will use two of the processors and is twice the width of low-end blades, meaning that only seven can fit into a single chassis. IBM believes the Cell blade will be useful for digital animation, scientific computing and medical imagines, said Juhi Jotwani, director BladeCenter Solutions. Although IBM said it will sell the Cell blade under special arrangement, meaning there's no set price, it's not for the faint of heart right now. It requires a special version of Linux--Red Hat's Fedora, supplemented by IBM patches downloadable from a University of Barcelona Web site--and there aren't any applications available yet, said Ted Maeurer, senior manager of Cell for IBM. "We're very early in the life of this technology. Today, we are just starting the collaboration with partners. One of the prerequisites to progress is having hardware out there," Maeurer said. However, he added, more than 260 potential partners have requested briefings under nondisclosure agreements. Mainstream chip options Blade chassis from different manufacturers can often handle varieties of blade server. For example, HP's BladeSystem can use blades with Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron chip, Intel's Xeon or Intel's Itanium. Sun Microsystems' second-generation blade, due to ship later this year, will accommodate both Opteron and Sun's own UltraSparc. For IBM, the choices are Opteron, Xeon and IBM's Power processor family. For Power chip fans, IBM will begin offering a new choice of blade: the PowerPC 970MP-based JS21. This 970MP processor has dual-processing engines, compared with the single core of the PowerPC 970FX used in the current JS20 blade. The PowerPC 970 MP also includes a significant new virtualization feature that lets several operating systems run on a blade simultaneously. That's a major trend as computer users try to wring more use out of existing systems to cut costs and reduce growing electrical power demands. The JS21 will cost $2,499 for a basic single-core model. IBM didn't immediately supply prices for dual-core models with more memory. Another blade model will use Intel's forthcoming "Sossaman" version Xeon. That chip, based on its Core mobile processors that went by the Yonah code name, consumes much less power than conventional Xeons. The low-power HS20 blade is due to arrive in April with a starting price of $1,749. Another option, due in the second quarter, will be a faster InfiniBand switch from Cisco, IBM said.
2000-05-25 - IBM boosts speeds of Intel server  IBM has revamped its most powerful Intel server with new chips, boosting performance by about 20 percent to 30 percent. The new NUMA-Q E410 can accommodate as many as 64 Pentium III Xeon chips, the same number as previous designs. The new model benefits not only from Intel's latest 700-MHz models with built-in high-speed cache memory but also from improved supporting chips that enable information to be transferred faster within the computer, said Steve Fry, manager of NUMA-Q marketing at IBM. IBM acquired the NUMA-Q design when it bought Sequent in 1999. NUMA, which stands for "non-uniform memory access," refers to a particular way of designing computers stuffed with dozens or even hundreds of processors. In a NUMA system, the memory is split into several sections rather than being located in one large central area; the hard part is writing an operating system that can adjust between the different response times of memory that's close to a processor and memory that's distant. SGI and EMC also build NUMA designs, but IBM sees the main competition for its NUMA-Q machines to be the more powerful Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard, Fry said. A basic entry-level system costs about $73,000, but more typical configurations will cost closer to $300,000, and one with all 64 processors and lots of software costs about $4 million. Though the design comes from outside IBM, Big Blue is working to make NUMA-Q its own. One part of that effort is to ensure Linux software will run on it. However, IBM hasn't yet decided whether it will tweak Linux itself to get it to run on the NUMA systems or will instead create different software that allows NUMA's current Dynix/PTX version of Unix to run Linux programs. The latter approach would be the fastest way to ensure Linux software will run on the NUMA-Q machines, a key part of IBM's plan to have all its four server lines able to run Linux software. Getting an operating system to run on a NUMA system is no mean feat. SGI is working on that very project with its own version of Linux. IBM plans to release a new NUMA-Q server in the first quarter of 2001 that uses as many as 16 Itanium processors, Fry said. Also today, IBM introduced a new low-end two-processor Intel server, the Netfinity 3500 M20, said Jay Bretzmann, manager of Netfinity's strategy. Starting prices are $1,830.
2006-07-25 - IBM boosts high-end Unix servers   IBM has brought the Power5+ processor to its top-end Unix servers, completing the transition and boosting performance during a period of rapid change in the server market. The company's 16-processor System p5-590 and 32-processor p5-595 will ship with the 2.3GHz Power5+ beginning Aug. 11, the company plans to announce Tuesday. The upgrade wrings about 30 percent more performance out of a system than the 1.9GHz Power5, said Karl Freund, vice president of IBM's System p Unix server line, formerly called pSeries. The new systems arrive at an important moment. Sun Microsystems, though vanquished from its former position at the top of the Unix server heap, has been resurgent with systems using its UltraSparc IV+ processor. And Intel, whose Itanium processors are used in Hewlett-Packard's Unix systems, has just announced a new model code-named Montecito. IBM could use a kick in its server business. In overall server revenue, HP made up ground to tie IBM for first place in the first quarter of 2006, according to market researcher IDC. "In the latest quarter, we had customers holding off purchasing (while) waiting for the introduction of Power5+ into the high end. This will fill those expectations," Freund said. "Hopefully, it will give us the boost we need at the high end." End of "forklift upgrade" With the new Power5+ generation comes a new element to IBM's server strategy: the end of the "forklift upgrade." Instead of customers having to buy entire new servers, refrigerator-size machines that often weigh one ton, they'll be able to upgrade just the internal processor-memory boards when they want to upgrade to Power6, due to arrive in 2007, Freund said. "We've always been a forklift upgrade. It drives our customer account reps crazy," Freund said. HP and Sun have offered board upgrades for years and criticized IBM for its design the entire time. The board upgrade applies not just to the p5-590 and p5-595, but also to the midrange p5-570, Freund said. IBM didn't have specific pricing information but said the new servers would be slotted in at about the same price as the previous Power5-based models. Along with the new server, IBM plans to announce a new world record on the TPC-C server speed test, with the p5-595 able to perform 4.02 million database transactions per minute. That's 25 percent better than the last top spot, the Power5-based p5-595 at 3.21 million. The top non-IBM result is a 2005 test of HP's Itanium-based Superdome, clocked at 1.23 million transactions per minute, but the Palo Alto, Calif.-based rival is toiling over a more up-to-date score with the "Montecito" chips, the first Itaniums to follow the dual-core server pathway that IBM pioneered in 2001. HP's Montecito-based models are due to begin shipping in September, though beginning with low-end models rather than the top-end Superdome. New virtualization IBM was a pioneer in dividing a separate system into many partitions that handle multiple jobs efficiently, a process that requires technology called virtualization. While the idea debuted in mainframes, it's now commonplace on Unix servers and arriving on mainstream machines with servers that use x86 processors such as Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron. With the 595 announcement, IBM also is adding new virtualization technology based on IBM's acquisition in 2005 of CIMS Labs. The software, part of IBM's Tivoli management suite, lets customers monitor exactly how much processing, networking and storage a given application uses. That can improve capacity planning so administrators don't buy more computing horsepower than they need, and it also can help when companies charge particular divisions for how much computer time they use, Freund said. The new monitoring software product is called the Tivoli Usage and Accounting Manager. One significant change with the Power5+ generation is the use of DDR2 memory. Although the faster processor was responsible for about 40 percent of the improved TPC-C score, the faster memory accounted for about 25 percent, Freund said. IBM also upgraded processors in the rest of its System p line, according to its announcements to customers. The p5-550 now can be purchased with a dual-core, 2.1GHz Power5+. The p5-550Q, which uses a chip package called a quad-core module, is available with 1.65GHz Power5+ chips. The p5-510 is available with single-core and dual-core 2.1GHz Power5+ processors. The p5-510Q is available in a quad-core, 1.65GHz configuration. The p5-505 is available with a single-core 1.9GHz Power5+ with no L3 cache memory; a dual-core Power5+ with 36MB L3 cache; and a dual-core 2.1GHz Power5+ with 36MB cache. The p5-505Q is available in a quad-core, 1.65GHz configuration.
2001-12-18 - IBM beckons Linux fans to server line  In an effort to increase the number of programs available for its relatively unknown iSeries line of special-purpose servers, IBM is courting Linux programmers by letting them tap into an iSeries server over the Internet. The Test Drive program lets programmers use the version of Linux from either SuSE or Turbolinux running on an iSeries system, IBM will announce Tuesday. Red Hat, the most popular version of Linux, will be supported in January. The strategy mirrors one adopted by Intel, which funded efforts to let programmers access servers that were using its scarce, then-prototype Itanium chip. And VA Software houses a "compile farm" where programmers can try out Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Solaris 8, as well as Linux on Power PC, Alpha and UltraSparc chips. Servers in the iSeries line, formerly called the AS/400 line, can run several "virtual" Linux servers in separate partitions that share the hardware used by the native iSeries operating system, OS/400. An iSeries machine can house as many as 31 Linux partitions. IBM hopes to benefit from its embrace of the Linux operating system--a clone of Unix that competes with its progenitor as well as with Windows. IBM believes Linux will become a standard part of the computing infrastructure. Unlike Windows and most versions of Unix, Linux and higher-level server software aren't locked to one or two chip designs, but rather can run on a multitude of computer types. So Linux software works nearly the same across IBM's four major server lines. In addition, Linux is popular with up-and-coming programmers in college today, and Big Blue hopes to capture some of their attention and respect.
2003-04-22 - IBM backs Opteron server chip  Advanced Micro Devices' new Opteron processor has received a major vote of confidence from IBM. Big Blue on Tuesday announced its intention to use the AMD server chip in future server hardware, including a server platform and high-performance computing clusters. IBM's decision could pave the way toward greater acceptance of AMD processors in the corporate environment, a goal that has eluded the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based chipmaker for nearly two decades. For years, AMD had difficulty landing its chips in computers for the working world because of recurring manufacturing problems, performance issues and a general reluctance among corporate buyers to try new technology. AMD's reputation, though, is changing. IBM's decision to adopt Opteron was based on customer feedback, according to Mark Shearer, the company's vice president of eServer systems. Companies have been asking for a server that can deliver relatively high performance, including 64-bit capabilities, for a lower price, Shearer said at AMD's event here to introduce the chip to analysts and the press. Other companies are lining up behind the chip as well. Fujitsu-Siemens has said it would come out with an Opteron workstation, and Sun Microsystems is looking into using the chip. On Tuesday, RackSaver and other smaller server and workstation makers released products. Meanwhile, Microsoft, Oracle and several Linux companies have pledged to come out with software tweaked for Opteron. Additionally, IBM is working with AMD on processor manufacturing technology, which analysts say could prevent the sort of manufacturing mishaps that have derailed AMD in the past. "IBM has invested the most time," said Hector Ruiz, AMD chief executive, in an interiew. "They're all getting close to that. In the next one or two quarters, they'll make a decision on whether or not to offer an Opteron server." But the company's earlier efforts to take on market leader Intel have often come to a grisly end. While AMD often gains market share and sees profits at the beginning of the life of a new chip, it also soon finds itself swimming in red ink because of aggressive price cuts and technology enhancements from Intel. Opteron was delayed for over a year, and the desktop version of the chip will come to market almost two years late. In addition, customer enthusiasm for new technology has waned. Microsoft came out with a version of Windows for Digital's Alpha processor at one point, but phased it out after slow sales. IBM stopped offering AMD's Athlon chips in its NetVista desktop line in August 2001. Similarly, IBM started to resell a blade server from RLX Technologies that used chips from Transmeta, but then came out with its own blade server, signed a blade alliance with Intel and cancelled its deal with RLX. AMD says it will overcome the challenges, particularly because the relatively small size of its processor will make it difficult for Intel to undercut the chip's price. "The Opteron processor...will bring PC economics to even the most expensive servers," AMD Chairman Jerry Sanders said. Paraphrasing Winston Churchill, he added "never in the history of Microsoft-compatible microprocessors will so few do so much for so many." IBM will likely offer Opteron in a new server family, alongside its existing Intel-based xSeries servers. The company, though, did not give any details about server hardware or a date of introduction. IBM is believed to be working with Newisys, a server start-up staffed by ex-IBM employees, to design these systems. AMD has been following Intel for years, delivering its own version of the same kind of processor, based on the x86 architecture pioneered by Intel. Its latest is the Athlon XP, which has been successful in desktop and notebook PCs for consumers and is also offered in some systems for business. But with the Opteron, and its underlying architecture, AMD has set out to chart its own course, by altering x86 to support 64-bit addressing. This twist allows the chip, and its forthcoming desktop and notebook sibling, to utilize more memory and provides some other performance enhancements. But AMD also designed the chip to support 32-bit software, the current standard for applications like Microsoft Office. "We promise the AMD Opteron will simplify business by removing all the barriers to 64-bit computing," said Marty Seyer, senior vice president of AMD's server business. "It outperforms the highest published results from both (Intel) Xeon and Itanium," The Opteron 800 series will allow manufacturers to build four-processor servers priced below $10,000--a big shift downward in price, Seyer said, offering high performance to more companies. These systems are expected to hit the market later this quarter. "We're going to play a role in establishing a new price point in four-way servers. Right now, there is a lot of distance between two-way and eight-way servers," said Rob Herb, executive vice president of sales and marketing. "AMD is going to create a new price performance category in the four-way space."
2004-02-18 - IBM backs 64-bit Intel chip plan   SAN FRANCISCO--IBM is eager to embrace Intel's newly announced 64-bit Xeon processors, building support for them into chipsets at the heart of Big Blue's next-generation servers. "We have already enabled our chipsets to exploit the Xeon extensions," Tom Bradicich, chief technology officer of IBM's Intel-based server line, said in an interview at the Intel Developer Forum here. The 64-bit support will arrive in the Enterprise X Architecture (EXA) 3 chipset due in 2005, he said. Chipsets are crucial components that connect processors with each other, memory, and subsystems such as storage and networking. IBM's EXA3 chipset, due in 2005, will enable servers with as many as 64 Xeon processors to be built, Bradicich said in January. Intel's first 64-bit capable Xeon, code-named Nocona, is due in the second quarter of 2004 for dual-processor systems. IBM's EXA3 chipset requires the more powerful "Potomac" Xeon for systems with four or more processors. Potomac is also due in 2005. As expected, Intel Chief Executive Craig Barrett announced the company's 64-bit Xeon chips Tuesday. The technology is a major change for Intel: It sidesteps the 4GB memory barrier of 32-bit chips; catches up to Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron, a rival 64-bit "x86" processor; puts some pressure on Intel's higher-end 64-bit Itanium family; and frees Intel to compete more directly with Opteron. IBM supports Itanium, which runs software for x86 chips only through a slower emulation mode, but believes Xeon is more important. "I really believe the combination of customer demand and independent software vendor investment is going to strongly shape the success of Xeon," Bradicich said. IBM also is anticipating new features with Potomac, Bradicich added. In addition to the better performance, Potomac will bring better reliability and security, he said. IBM's EXA3 chipset has been tuned to the different characteristics of the 64-bit Xeon, including its faster DDR2 memory interface, its wider 64-bit memory pathway and its capabilities for inter-processor communication, Bradicich said. Compared with the first-generation DDR memory in use today, DDR2 requires 30 percent less power for a given level of performance, Bradicich said. That's important for blade servers in particular, where space constraints mean that waste heat resulting from power consumption is more of a problem. DDR2 memory modules also incorporate some electronics that previously were separate on a motherboard, making it easier to build computers, Bradicich added. Other server makers warm to new Xeon Adding Itanium into a server line has been a major change for server makers, but dealing with the 64-bit Xeon will be a much simpler process since it's just the next-generation Intel server chip and it can run the existing server software unchanged. Indeed, several server makers already are planning support. Hewlett-Packard plans to ship servers with the 64-bit Intel technology in the second quarter, after Intel releases Nocona, spokesman Tim Willeford said. HP is a notable case because it co-developed the Itanium architecture and is heavily committed to the chip as a replacement for its own PA-RISC chips. At the same time, though, HP plans to sell servers using AMD's Opteron, sources say. Unisys, which like IBM hopes to profit by selling high-end multiprocessor Xeon servers, also said it will sell servers using the technology as soon as Intel releases the new chips. And the 64-bit extensions to Xeon give Unisys a counterweight to AMD's Opteron. "Unisys is standing by Intel and its technology, as our enterprise clients have made it clear to us that they seek Intel solutions to their mission-critical operations," a Unisys representative said in a statement. Dell will ship Nocona servers midyear, spokeswoman Wendy Giever said. Sun Microsystems, which has only recently accepted x86 chips into its product line but hopes to get an edge through its avid support of Opteron, declined to comment for this story.
2004-07-13 - IBM attacks Unix rivals with Power5    IBM is expected to announce a new generation of Unix servers on Tuesday, systems it believes powerful enough to let Big Blue topple rivals Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard. As previously reported, IBM will announce low-end and midrange models using the new Power5 processor: the dual-processor eServer p5 520, the four-processor p5 550 and the 16-processor p5 570. The systems, which boost performance and can run many operating systems simultaneously, will ship by Aug. 31. The products are strong, analysts say, and arrive at a time when Sun and Hewlett-Packard, the No. 1 and No. 2 Unix server sellers, are vulnerable. "Sun and HP have begun refreshes to technologies that are competitive, but they're not there yet," Forrester analyst Brad Day said. Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice had a similar assessment. "IBM is at a very strong point in its product cycle right now. Its competitors are at a bit of an ebb because of their transitional issues," Eunice said, referring to Sun's embrace of Fujitsu's high-end Sparc64 processor and HP's switch from its PA-RISC chips to Intel's Itanium. For the first time, the p5 systems use identical hardware as their i5 server brethren, which debuted in May. That convergence means a larger customer base supports IBM engineering resources and that three operating systems--IBM's AIX version of Unix, its i5/OS for midrange machines, and Linux from either Red Hat or Novell--now can run at the same time on the same systems. The higher-end Unix models are due by the end of the year, including a 64-processor model, said Ravi Arimilli, chief technology officer of eServer microprocessors and systems development and an IBM fellow. And if customers express an interest, a 128-processor machine could be built when systems using the smaller, faster Power5+ arrive in 2005, he added. Prices begin at $11,185 for a p5 520 with 1GB of memory, two 1.65GHz Power5 processors, two 36GB hard drives and a year of AIX support, said Jim McGaughan, director of IBM's server strategy and one of the founding members of the company's Unix server group. A p5 550, with four 1.65GHz processors, 8GB of memory and two 73GB drives costs $32,487, while a p5 570 with 16 1.9GHz processors, 32GB of high-speed DDR2 (double data rate 2) memory and two 73GB drives costs $503,090. Annual AIX licenses add $1,080 per processor per year for the 520 and 550 and $1,950 per processor per year for the 570, McGaughan added. The Unix server market is a sweet spot for server makers, nicely positioned between mainframe power and high price on the one hand and Microsoft Windows' broad software support but relative immaturity on the other. IBM missed out on the Unix boom of the 1990s, when lavish spending poured money into Sun's coffers. With the Power4 generation and Sun's troubles, IBM has been gaining Unix share. In 2003, IBM's revenue grew 13 percent to $4.1 billion, while Sun's shrank 16 percent to $5.4 billion and HP's shrank 4 percent to $5.3 billion, according to research company Gartner. IBM admits it was caught flat-footed by Sun's surge. "When I was appointed chief architect for Power, the game was simple. We had to get back into the game. Power4 was (a) do-or-die mission. We had to get running fast because our market share was so small," Arimilli said. Technology now and later IBM has a simple future planned for the Power line: Power5 this year, a faster remake called Power5+ in 2005, Power6 in 2006, Power6+ in 2007, Power7 in 2008 and Power7+ in 2009, said Arimilli, who has just been named chief architect of the Power7 models. Also coming with Power5 is simultaneous multithreading (SMT), an ability for a single processor to handle some of the work of two. The technology gives about a 30 percent performance boost, IBM said, but requires the new AIX version 5.3. A $4 million 16-processor p5 570 with 128GB of memory and IBM's DB2 database software achieved 809,000 transactions per minute on the widely watched Transaction Processing Performance Council's TPC-C test of database performance. That's the third-fastest result for a single system, trailing the No. 1 IBM p690 with 32 Power4 chips and the No. 2 HP Superdome with 64 Itanium 2 chips. One of the major new features of the Power5 servers is "micro-partitioning," the ability to run as many as 10 operating systems on each processor. The feature makes it easier to replace multiple systems with a single centrally managed machine, especially because management software can automatically reallocate resources as work loads shift. The new partitioning addresses a major weakness of the Power4 generation: the requirement that each partition have its own adapters for networking and storage systems. "When we looked at Power4, at a certain point, it became cost-prohibitive to slice it up into logical partitions," said Robert Gamso, senior principal systems architect at appliance maker Whirlpool, a longtime IBM Unix server customer with about 100 systems. IBM will improve flexibility of portioning will improve when the Power5+ in 2005, when one machine will be able to move a partition quickly to another. The feature is available today, but only using a relatively slow networked storage system; with the Power5+ systems it will happen "in a matter of a few seconds" using conventional Ethernet networking, Arimilli said. A new Linux priority with Power5 meant a change to the IBM's typical approach of adapting the operating system to the processor. With Linux, the influence went the other direction after IBM found programmers unwilling to relinquish Linux's general-purpose but sometimes slower design, Arimilli said. Linux led to about 20 additions to the Power5 design in areas such as how the chip addresses memory and locks computing resources that are in use, Arimilli said. The changes mean that Linux runs about 90 to 95 percent the speed of AIX instead of 80 percent, Arimilli said--though AIX gets a much smaller boost from the hardware changes as well. "AIX is still superior, but as years go by, that gap will close," Arimilli said. And for now, "Linux on Power5 will have much better performance than Linux on other architectures." Right now, Linux isn't well enough supported by software companies and others to make its worthwhile on Whirlpool's Power servers, though the company does use it on Intel-based systems, Gamso said. That could change: "Once the rest of the market catches up and all the ISVs (independent software vendors) are there, then it's viable," he said. The competition "Everyone has been on the defensive about a resurgent IBM for some years now," Eunice said, but competitors are fighting back. Sun is using a three-pronged chip strategy, while HP argues it will benefit from Intel's Itanium chips for higher-end servers. Sun's first prong is a partnership with Fujitsu, which is bringing a dose of mainframe expertise to its Sparc64 VI processor. Second is two "chip multithreading" designs that can run several instruction sequences simultaneously, midrange "Niagara" and higher-end "Rock." Third is pushing its Solaris version of Unix for Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron processors, newer members of the "x86" processors such as Intel's Pentium and Xeon. Sun has been trying to sell large quantities of servers to preserve its customer base, even if it meant heavy discounts, but that emphasis is changing, said Chief Competitive Officer Larry Singer. "The focus of the company is shifting very much to revenue growth and profitability," he said. Sun also has an answer to micro-partitioning: N1 Grid Containers, a feature due to arrive by year-end in Solaris 10. These containers make a single version of the operating system appear to have multiple independent instances, and the technology works on x86 chips as well as Sparc chips from Sun and Fujitsu. Don Jenkins, vice president of marketing for HP's Business Critical Server group, sees several Power5 problems. "The most difficult issue for Power5 is the fact it's proprietary and doesn't run Windows and is an inadequate Linux platform," he said. In addition, a customer buying Itanium servers can get them from multiple companies, whereas Power5 comes only from IBM. "Proprietary" and "open" are relative terms, though. Itanium systems are available from several server makers, but the chip is only available from Intel. At the same time, Power servers come only from IBM, but many other companies sell variants of the Power chip for various other segments of the computing market. And while HP currently can't split subdivide a processor so it can run several operating systems, that feature is coming, Jenkins said. "We are close to bringing out sub-CPU partitioning capability as well," he said. Two factors likely will mean Itanium systems ultimately will outship Power servers, said Insight64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. The main reason: "Itanium systems can address not only the proprietary Unix market, but also the Windows market," he said. The other factor: "If you want a Power system, you're going to buy it from IBM. If you want an Itanium system, you can buy it from HP, NEC, Fujitsu, Hitachi, and others." HP and Intel argued that Itanium would bring a radical new design to last 20 years--far beyond the RISC (reduced instruction set computing) chips such as IBM's Power and Sun's UltraSparc. But so far, that advantage hasn't shown up, Eunice said. "Nothing I have seen indicates the Power architecture is running out of steam."
2006-08-01 - IBM announces full AMD Opteron server line IBM has dramatically expanded a partnership to use Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron processors in its servers, announcing on Tuesday a full-fledged server line geared for mainstream business use. The move, first reported by CNET News.com, gives IBM a stronger portfolio to counter Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and Dell, which already have embraced mainstream Opteron servers. It also gives AMD a more powerful ally during a time when Intel is trying hard to reverse market share losses. Bill Zeitler, head of IBM's server group, and Hector Ruiz, AMD's chief executive, announced the alliance at an event in New York. The new servers will ship within the next three months, IBM said, but it won't detail prices until the launch of the next-generation "Rev F" Opteron chips. That's expected Aug. 15 at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo in San Francisco, according to sources familiar with the event. Big Blue's lineup already included AMD-based servers for the high-performance technical computing market as well as a dual-processor blade server. Now the product line becomes much broader, with mainstream rack-mounted business servers accommodating two or four processors, and an upgrade that permits two dual-processor blades to be linked into a four-processor server. The change is the latest in a series of victories for AMD. Since introducing Opteron in April 2003, it has rewritten the rules of the x86 server market, which rival Intel previously had to itself. AMD got ahead of Intel with power-efficient designs with fast memory and communications subsystems and a 64-bit design, and it now has 25.9 percent market share in x86 servers. Intel began its effort to introduce 64-bit chips, which accommodate vastly larger amounts of memory than 32-bit models, with Itanium. But that processor effectively couldn't run software designed for x86 chips such as Pentium or Opteron. IBM was drawn to AMD because of its chips' compatibility and strong technology, Zeitler said. "Compatibility and excellence in architecture and execution have really helped establish AMD and our partnership with AMD," he said. Woodcrest in waiting Intel is fighting back with its "Woodcrest" Xeon 5100 family for dual-processor servers, which improve performance while reducing power consumption. But it still has a long way to go: Its forthcoming "Tulsa" Xeon for four-processor machines still is based on the discredited and power-hungry NetBurst architecture. "I've been very impressed with Woodcrest. Intel has done an amazing job," said Scott Tease, the worldwide product manager for IBM's BladeCenter servers. But, he added, "I can't help thinking that some of that competitive spirit has come back to Intel because of AMD being there." AMD's Rev F Opterons use faster memory and add virtualization abilities that increase server efficiency. In addition, Rev F chips plug into a new socket with 1,207 electrical connections that will accommodate quad-core successors, thought to be called "Rev G," in 2007. Tease offered some details on IBM's new servers. All will be available in the third quarter of this year, except the dual-processor System x3655, due shortly after, he said. The System x3755 is a rack-mounted four-processor model that IBM says is good for car crash simulations or databases, for example. The system, 7 inches thick, has business-oriented features such as systems management and backup power supplies, and it accommodates as much as 128GB of memory. The System x3655 is a dual-processor model for mainstream business tasks such as databases. It's 3.5 inches thick, has management features and redundant power, and accommodates up to 64GB of memory. The System x3455 is an update to the e326, a 1.75-inch-thick, rack-mounted dual-processor machine for high-performance computing. It lacks redundant power. The BladeCenter LS21 is an update to the existing LS20 two-processor blade using the Rev F Opteron chips. It's the same width, 30mm, meaning that as many as 14 can be plugged into one BladeCenter chassis. The BladeCenter LS41 is a four-processor blade. It's built on an LS21 foundation, but with higher-end Opteron processors. A second electronics board can be attached to double the processor count--along with the width and number of BladeCenter chassis slots. IBM has some serious competition already, though. HP, by a sizable margin the leading x86 server seller, already provides the 7-inch, four-Opteron ProLiant DL585 and the 3.5-inch-thick, two-Opteron DL385. It's expected to update those systems with Rev F-based designs later this month. And the most aggressive Opteron strategy is from Sun, which is using the chip to try to gain a foothold in the x86 server market it shunned for years. It began its hard charge last year with dual-Opteron models: the 1.75-inch Sun Fire X4100 and 3.5-inch X4200. It expanded the effort in July with the eight-processor X4600, the storage-rich X4500, and the massive Sun Blade 8000 with four-Opteron blades. Even Dell has decided to add Opteron servers, announcing in May it will sell a four-processor model. It had long been an Intel-only computer maker. IBM reheats AMD alliance Of the top four server makers--collectively responsible for about four-fifths of spending in the market--Big Blue was the first to sell Opteron servers. But its first models were only for a limited market of high-performance computing, where customers didn't need features such as backup power supplies. That changed somewhat in 2005 with the introduction of Opteron blades, which Zeitler said now account for 30 percent of IBM's blade server shipments. But still, Opteron systems were something of a red-headed stepchild. For example, they weren't sold under the xSeries server brand, which only described Intel-based systems. That changed this year, when IBM moved to the System x brand, which encompasses both Intel- and AMD-based servers. IBM also is sinking engineering resources into the AMD servers by putting within the 8-year-old Enterprise X Architecture an initiative to bring high-end mainframe technology to mainstream x86 servers, said Susan Whitney, head of the System x business. "What you see today leverages AMD Opteron technology and marries it with IBM's Enterprise X Architecture," Whitney said. One result, she argued, is performance that increases proportionally as more processors are added, rather than employing only a diminishing fraction of each new chip's ability. That so-called linear scalability is the result of IBM's "pass-through" technology that connects to Opteron's HyperTransport on-chip communication links. Another EXA feature for Opteron is "accelerated memory," which means the memory communication links run at a full 667MHz even when fully loaded with memory; other designs ratchet back to 533MHz when more than four memory modules are used, she said.
2006-12-06 - IBM accuses mainframe cloner of patent infringement    IBM has sued Platform Solutions, which aims to sell servers that will run software designed for Big Blue's mainframes, alleging patent infringement and breach of contract. IBM, which filed the suit last week in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, claims that Platform Solutions (PSI) has violated the terms of a customer agreement with the technology giant and infringed five patents. PSI declined to comment on the suit's specifics, but Christian Reilly, vice president of product management and marketing at the server specialist, called it "unjustified." "We believe IBM sees us as real competition. We provide customers with an alternative," Reilly said. The company, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is developing servers that use Intel's Itanium processors but that can run z/OS, IBM's mainframe operating system, alongside higher-level mainframe software. The move to bring the software to comparatively mainstream systems is unusual: z/OS today runs on IBM mainframes that use an entirely different processor. PSI's machines also can run more conventional operating systems--including Linux, Windows and Unix--that are already geared for Itanium. The company is currently testing its servers with select customers and plans to begin selling its systems early next year, Reilly said. In its complaint, IBM said PSI holds an IBM customer agreement that allows it to license Big Blue's operating system software and other software, but only as an end-user. The license agreement "expressly prohibits, among other things, any translation of the licensed software programs," IBM states in its complaint. IBM also alleges PSI's "emulator," or translation, systems infringe on its five patents: 5,696,709; 5,825,678; 5,953,520; 5,987,495; and 6,801,993. PSI is not the first company that has tried to horn in on IBM's mainframe business. In the mainframe's heyday, Amdahl, eventually acquired by Fujitsu, made "plug-compatible" systems that could run mainframe software. Amdahl and Hitachi, however, left the mainframe market in early 2000. On its Web site, PSI says that the company was originally set up in 1999 by a core team of former Amdahl engineers. IBM also argues in its lawsuit that it has refused to license its patents and copyrighted mainframe software for use in PSI's servers. Big Blue further notes that PSI is claiming IBM has violated federal antitrust laws by refusing to do so. PSI declined to comment on the alleged antitrust assertions. PSI has not filed an antitrust lawsuit against IBM.
2003-07-30 - HP's Unix beats Windows in server test Hewlett-Packard released new server speed-test results Wednesday that, for the first time, compare its version of Unix with Windows on the company's top-end Itanium server--and Unix came out ahead. An HP Integrity Superdome with 64 Itanium 2 6M "Madison" processors posted a score of 824,000 transactions per minute on the Transaction Processing Performance Council's widely watched TPC-C test of a single computer running a busy database. The speed beat not only IBM's previous No. 1 result of 764,000 in June but also the previous top result before that, in May, of 707,000 transactions from a system made up of an HP Superdome server running Windows. The result provides instructive new information in the years-long competition between Unix and Windows. Although the two operating systems have been pitted against each other, rarely has it been on the same hardware. Although the system with HP's version of Unix, called HP-UX, was faster, it cost $6.8 million compared with $5.1 million for the Windows system. HP's Superdome can simultaneously run Linux, Windows and HP-UX in separate partitions. However, the collection of software needed to make such a system is more mature for HP-UX than for Windows or Linux. HP, which co-developed the Itanium chip designs along with manufacturer Intel, has been working for years on fostering Itanium support among programmers, software companies, business partners and customers. HP is in the process of simplifying several server lines, gradually replacing Compaq Computer's Alpha processor, SGI's MIPS and HP's own PA-RISC with Itanium. In the meantime, though, HP is updating the existing lines to give customers plenty of time to switch. On Wednesday, HP said it began shipping a new high-end AlphaServer, the 32-processor GS1280, which is based on the newer EV7 version of the Alpha. Later this year a 64-processor model will arrive. Another update in 2004 will use the faster EV79 processor, the last of the Alpha lineage originally developed at Digital Equipment. Meanwhile, HP's prime competitors, Sun Microsystems and IBM, are hoping to profit from the changes among HP's customers in coming years. If customers are going to switch to a new server, Sun and IBM argue, they might as well also switch to a new company.
2005-11-01 - HP's Itanium blade due in early 2006   Hewlett-Packard will begin selling next year its first blade servers that use Intel's Itanium processor, the company announced Tuesday. As expected, the move means the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company will be able to offer its HP-UX version of Unix on its BladeSystem products. Those servers today are available only with x86 processors--Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron--and can run Linux and Windows. HP's Integrity BL60p accommodates two "Madison 9M" Itanium chips, the current top-end model that has 9MB of on-board cache memory. A model with two 1.6GHz chips, 4GB of memory, two hard drives and an HP-UX license will cost $5,695, the company said. Through partitioning features available on the system, a single blade can be divided to run as many as six separate instances of HP-UX 11i v2. Although Itanium servers can run Windows and Linux, those operating systems won't be supported until the second half of HP's next fiscal year, which ends Oct. 31, 2006. Server makers are interested in the market as a way to stand above the herd of mainstream servers and to tap into a business that's growing 10 times faster than the overall server market. In the second quarter of 2005, blade server revenue grew 49 percent to $419 million compared with 4.7 percent growth to $12.2 billion for the overall server market, according to Gartner. HP's blades are arriving later than planned. In 2004, HP said it expected Itanium blades to arrive in mid-2005. HP is second in the blade market to IBM, whose BladeCenter product can run Big Blue's AIX version of Unix on blades with PowerPC processor. And through a deal disclosed last week, IBM will support Sun Microsystems' Solaris on its blades. Dell sells only Xeon-based blades, and Sun, the fourth major server company, has said it plans to re-enter the blade server market in early 2006. HP, which initiated the Itanium project and helped Intel bring the high-end chip family to market, remains the chip's biggest supporter. However, the new "Montecito" version of Itanium, originally due in late 2005 and sporting dual processing cores, has been delayed until mid-2006. Rich Marcello, general manager of HP's Business Critical Server group, said the blades are aimed chiefly at customers who use the company's ProLiant line of x86 servers. "It's really more for those customers who have grown up on ProLiant systems management and say now, 'Maybe we can use a Unix blade here,'" Marcello said. The HP BL60p models are the same size as the company's dual-processor Opteron and Xeon blades: Eight fit in a 10.5-inch-tall rack-mounted chassis. The different server types can be mixed and matched in the same chassis. HP said the BL60p outperforms IBM's JS20 blade server, which runs Linux and AIX, posting a score of 63,561 business operations per second on the SPECjbb2000 Java server benchmark to IBM's 39,631. Correction: This story incorrectly described a server configuration used in a speed test. The configuration used two single-core Itanium processors.
2005-10-18 - HP's chief exec dismisses any 'me too' attitude    ORLANDO, Fla.--Hewlett-Packard's chief executive says his game plan for the company is simple: Stick to the basics. Mark Hurd, who was appointed as CEO in March less than two months after the ouster of Carly Fiorina, said Tuesday that HP will get back to building core technology and improving its relationships with customers. Hurd spoke Tuesday in a keynote address at Gartner's Symposium/ITxpo conference here. HP will focus more closely on three areas: Servers, storage and management software. "You will see us double down on those businesses," Hurd said. Mark HurdCEO, HP He also reiterated that HP has no plans to exit either the PC or printer businesses. "If there is anything I didn't want to continue in, I wouldn't bring it up here. But thanks for your concern," Hurd said, joking with Gartner analysts who questioned the CEO during a 45-minute discussion. Hurd, who spent 25 years at NCR before joining HP, took the opportunity to distance himself from some of strategies put in place by Fiorina, such as a deal that HP made with Apple Computer to resell iPod digital audio players. "The way I look at it, for instance, the iPod was not an interesting, eh, excursion: Taking a product and stamping our logo on it and shipping it to the market isn't good for us, including in some cases taping $10 bills to them. That didn't make sense," he said. HP stopped selling iPods over the summer. Hurd was hired to strengthen HP's operations and has focused on improving the company's financial performance through layoffs and a realignment of its sales team. "Storage is better for HP than iPods. We are not going to spin off printers, or get rid of PCs, but we are constantly looking to adjust," he said. As for Itanium-based servers, Hurd said that HP remains committed. "If you buy Itanium, you have my commitment for support. We're committed. Intel is committed," he said. HP will also work to improve its relationship with customers. "We will ship 50 million printers, 30 million PCs, a couple of million servers. We are going to try to do a better job of serving that customer base," Hurd said. As for competitors, Hurd was asked how to avoid making HP seem like a "me too" company in relation to IBM and Dell. "I don't know about those 'me too' comments. Those are mostly clever quips from press people, but that's not reality. I don't know who we would be 'me too' to. We?re a better company in some core areas than those other companies. Technology will be the differentiation. We are a tech company, and we will stay focused on that," he said. On Monday, market researchers said HP increased its PC shipments at a slightly faster pace than rival Dell, stemming--at least for now--what had become a widening gap between No. 1 Dell and No. 2 HP. Michael Dell, founder and chairman of Dell, is expected to speak Thursday at Gartner's conference. Later on Tuesday, Hurd is slated to speak at HP's Technology Forum 2005, a conference also taking place this week in Orlando. The HP conference was originally scheduled for last month in New Orleans, but was rescheduled in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and the severe flood damage in that city.
2004-05-05 - HP's 'adaptive enterprise' still murky for some    MUNICH, Germany--HP's introduction of the Darwin Reference Architecture at a customer event here this week did little to help customers grapple with the elusive concept of the "adaptive enterprise." As HP celebrated the first birthday of its vision of the adaptive enterprise concept, the company and its customers still seemed a little unsure of just what it is. Get Up to Speed on... Utility computing Get the latest headlines andcompany-specific news in ourexpanded GUTS section. HP executives at the ENSA@Work event, which attracted 5,400 attendees, devoted a great deal of keynote time to further explanations of the concept. The general idea is one of helping customers respond more quickly to changes in their operations by linking business processes more tightly with IT products. Nora Denzel, HP's senior vice president of adaptive enterprise and software, discussed the concept of the Darwin Reference Architecture, an element of the adaptive enterprise strategy, during a keynote speech Wednesday morning. Some who heard the term took it to mean the forthcoming extinction of the PA-RISC, Alpha and MIPS chips from the company's servers. "Where is the adaptive enterprise?" asked Reg Palmer, OpenVMS systems manager and Tru64 administrator at Centrica, the company that owns British Gas, the AA and Onetel. Pointing to the stands which several conference-goers noted had the feeling of a school science project, he said, "Show it to me." If the adaptive enterprise eluded Palmer, the sense of what a lot of HP is doing with its platform strategy was not lost on him. "It did come as a nasty shock," said Palmer, referring to the first time he heard that the Alpha chip would be discontinued, "but if there will be no performance advantage in the future to justify the cost, then it makes sense, and we are now able to see a way ahead." In the future, Palmer said, he will be able to run Windows, Linux and OpenVMS on HP's Superdome servers. "So it turns out the processors will be Itaniums," he said with a shrug. "I really don't care (so long as the operating systems run). It will help, as more Tru64 features find their way into HP-UX (HP's flavor of Unix)." By the end of the year, said HP's Paul Miller, vice president of marketing for industry standard servers, customers will be able to run OpenVMS on Itanium. Although the company does not publicize the fact, customers can already buy Itanium systems with a prerelease version of OpenVMS 8.1. Customers like Palmer may be able to see a way ahead, but on Wednesday morning it was by all accounts still a little fuzzy. "We run a lot of critical systems on VMS and Tru64, and we'll keep those for several years yet," Palmer noted. "After that, I don't know. But if all this adaptive enterprise stuff means taking what you want, then maybe it's going to be a good thing." Matt Loney reports for London-based ZDNet UK.
2005-08-09 - HP works to bring Linux to NonStop servers SAN FRANCISCO--Hewlett-Packard has begun collaborating with universities in an effort to adapt Linux for its NonStop servers, a rarely used but very high-end product line. NonStop servers, four-processor modules that can be interconnected to form gargantuan configurations, run demanding tasks such as the Nasdaq trading system. Today, they use an exotic operating system called the NonStop Kernel, but HP has begun moving the product line closer to the mainstream by adopting Intel's relatively mainstream Itanium processors earlier this year. Now HP is seeing if the software can be made more mainstream as well, though it hasn't committed to swapping out the existing operating system. Martin Fink, head of HP's Open Source and Linux Organization and as of May its NonStop Enterprise Division as well, announced the Linux move at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo on Tuesday. "We're going to donate a collection of NonStop servers to premier universities around the world," Fink said. "With the help of (these) universities, we will be able to see interesting new capabilities in the Linux kernel and the Linux you use every day." Linux already runs on many other Itanium-based servers, including HP's Integrity product line. HP also announced it has moved 200 open-source packages to the NonStop line. By the end of this year, that number should reach 500, Fink said. HP isn't the only one to try to mix Linux and high-end servers. IBM for years has worked to establish the operating system on its zSeries mainframe line. Linux was responsible for much of the revenue growth in the line in recent years, and IBM announced another customer Tuesday, motor manufacturer Baldor Electric.
2001-03-07 - HP upgrading Unix servers amid sales turmoil   PALO ALTO, Calif.--Hewlett-Packard plans a new midrange Unix server later this year, a 16-processor machine that will put pressure on rivals IBM and Sun Microsystems--assuming HP can recover the goodwill of sales partners. HP's eight-processor N-class server--the current workhorse of the product line--will be upgraded with the coming PA-RISC 8700 chip, according to Mark Hudson, worldwide marketing manager for the Unix server line. The server will be joined by a higher-end product later this year, Hudson added. Midrange machines aren't the only new products on the horizon. HP plans to introduce servers that use a "bladed" architecture. Such a system squeezes several servers into one space to maximize computing power for customers who need it, such as Web hosting centers, Hudson said during an interview with CNET News.com. And HP's first machines using Intel's long-delayed Itanium processor--codeveloped by HP--will arrive in the third quarter, he said. While new technology is important for HP, many of the problems the company's Unix server group now faces lie elsewhere. The company acknowledges it badly botched its most recent quarter, losing market share to Sun and IBM and incurring the wrath of business partners that sell the servers. The frankness with which the company talks about its problems stands in stark contrast to its longer-term boldness. Hudson goes so far as to predict that Sun, the No. 1 seller of Unix servers today, will become an also-ran. "We think it's going to be a two-horse race in three or four years, and it's going to be HP and IBM," Hudson said. Sun, though, dominates the Unix server market today and doubtless won't go down without a fight. Though its new generation of servers has been long delayed, the company plans to release new midrange models based on the UltraSparc III chip March 21. The new models will benefit from "partitioning" abilities, which let a server be split into several independent parts and currently is available only on Sun's high-end E10000 server, HP's Superdome and mainframe computers. HP has made some inroads with high-end Superdome sales, though HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina has said it's taking longer to sell them than the company hoped. Hudson confirmed that HP won a bid to sell its Superdome systems to Cisco Systems. Another major win was for the heart of Oracle's production system, and HP continues to point to Amazon.com as one of its prime accounts. And despite Sun's tight partnership with AOL Time Warner's America Online division, "AOL is buying L-class (servers) up the gazooba," Hudson added. Reseller blues But the company also acknowledges that it faces problems getting resellers back on its side. The reseller problem was that HP didn't clearly delineate which companies it would sell to directly and which it would let resellers approach, Fiorina said in February. In addition, HP had cut back on advertising and other programs that help generate sales demand for those partners, just when rivals were increasing that investment. The result: Several HP-only shops added other companies' products to their sales lines. And an overly aggressive HP sales force stepped on resellers' toes, alienating the resellers by competing for the same customers. Currently, about half of Unix server revenue comes from HP and half through reseller partners, Hudson said. A few people believed HP should have about 60 percent of that share. They've since lost their jobs, he said. The reseller problem, combined with the loss of Internet-company spending, the economic slowdown and corporate spending delays, meant HP's Unix server sales grew only 6 percent in the most recent quarter. "That's not where it needs to be. Sun and IBM outgrew us substantially," Hudson said. Though the reseller problem had been brewing for six or nine months, HP didn't notice because sales through the year ended in October were good, with 20 percent revenue growth, Hudson said. To fix the problem, HP has instituted a "hard deck" that lists the large corporate accounts HP targets--sometimes with support of subcontracting resellers with specific expertise--and the smaller accounts left to resellers, Hudson said. Though HP is contrite about its reseller relations, the company is bending backward only for those who add services, software or other improvements to HP's products rather than simply selling an unmodified server. "We're not going to establish a relationship with someone who's just pushing boxes," Hudson said. Those companies will continue to be squeezed out of business by low profit margins, he said. New CPUs The N-class servers will be the first to use the PA-RISC 8700 CPU when the chip arrives in the second half of this year, Hudson said. Top-end Superdome machines will be next, with lower-end models the last to benefit. The new CPU will debut at several clock speeds--likely spanning the range from about 600MHz to as high as 800MHz to 900MHz--and will improve performance by about 30 percent to 40 percent over the current 8600 models, he said. Though HP is planning two more generations of the PA-RISC chips after the 8700, the company will begin its long-awaited move to computers based on Intel's Itanium chip this year, Hudson said. HP's version of the Unix operating system, HP-UX, works on the new chips along with Windows, Linux, IBM's AIX 5L and a handful of other operating systems. HP invented the architecture that underlies Itanium's design. HP approached Intel, the largest chipmaker, to make sure the chip wasn't relegated to niche status, but the chip has taken years longer to emerge than HP and Intel hoped. This year, though, HP finally will begin to see the fruits of the collaboration. With the arrival of the first Itanium system in the third quarter, HP will begin a gradual unification of the designs of HP's two main server lines, the PA-RISC-based Unix servers and the Intel-based NetServers. The Itanium machines will share the same product numbers and hardware across both lines, though separate divisions will market them, Hudson said. Duane Zitzner, president of HP's computing division, said he expects a version of Superdome with Itanium's successor, code-named McKinley, to arrive in the second half of 2002. Hudson said that plan still is on track.
2004-04-19 - HP unveils four-Opteron server Hewlett-Packard has begun selling a four-Opteron server, its second model to use the Advanced Micro Devices processor, and has brought the chip into its high-performance technical computing line. The ProLiant DL585 can accommodate as much as 64GB of memory; prices range from $8,299 for a system with two 1.6GHz chips and 2GB of memory to $22,396 with four 2.2GHz chips and 4GB of memory. The machine joins the dual-processor DL145, which HP debuted in February and which now can be bought as part of a technical computing "cluster" system as well as on its own. The Opteron processor has vaulted AMD to the front lines of the competition between IBM, HP and Sun Microsystems--three of the top four server makers. The processor can run software written for "x86" chips such as Intel's Xeon and AMD's Athlon, but it also sports high performance and adds 64-bit features that enable easier access to more than 4GB of memory. Opteron is on the eve of its first anniversary, but Intel is following with its own 64-bit extensions to its x86 line--scheduled to debut later this quarter in Xeon processors code-named Nocona. The 64-bit x86 chips compete somewhat with Intel's higher-end 64-bit processor, Itanium, which HP initiated and also supports, but which today doesn't gracefully run x86 software. Software must be reworked to take advantage of 64-bit x86 extensions, but support is starting to arrive. VMware, an EMC subsidiary whose software can let a server run several operating systems simultaneously, announced Monday that its products will support the 64-bit extensions within 18 months. Experimental support will arrive sooner in its workstation product, VMware added. Sun, which for years shunned x86 chips in favor of its own UltraSparc models, is using the Opteron to try to distinguish itself in the x86 server market. Last week Sun completed the acquisition of Kealia, a start-up launched by Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim that specializes in Opteron servers. Bechtolsheim is reclaiming his employee No. 1 badge at Sun as well as the title of senior vice president and chief architect in Sun's Network Systems organization, under the new management of John Fowler. Unlike HP, IBM and Dell, Sun is pushing its own version of Unix for x86 servers, called Solaris. On Monday, it unveiled a new promotion to try to spur more adoption. The promotion, which runs from April 27 to Dec. 31, lets customers spend $50,000 per year for 100 copies of Solaris x86 and an accompanying standard support package. A subscription for 500 copies costs $225,000, and one for 2,000 copies costs $800,000, Sun said Monday. The price is designed to appeal to Linux and Windows customers, Sun said. "This promotion makes Solaris the most competitively priced OS on x86 systems," John Loiacono, Sun's new executive vice president of software, said in a statement. The promotion is the latest example of Sun's attempt to get more of its money from subscriptions and other recurring revenue sources. Customers who sign up for the subscription can renew for two more years after the first, Sun said.
2003-07-23 - HP Unix gets key features from Compaq  Hewlett-Packard developers have moved some key features from Compaq Computer's version of Unix to its own HP-UX, an important part of the company's plan to eventually merge the two product lines. Compaq's Tru64 Unix was originally developed by Digital Equipment, the high-end computer maker that Compaq acquired in 1998. Tru64, formerly called Digital Unix, was notable in part for its sophisticated "clustering" capabilities, which link several servers so they function and appear as one. Clustering has been a forte for Digital, which pioneered the technology with what is now its OpenVMS operating system. HP engineers responsible for translating Tru64's TruCluster software to the HP-UX version of Unix now have the technology working on two-node HP-UX clusters, an HP representative said. It's a significant accomplishment, though HP-UX still doesn't match Tru64's support for eight-computer clusters. In addition, HP has translated the Advanced File System software from Tru64. HP is gradually phasing out Tru64, which runs on Alpha processors, in favor of HP-UX, which runs on HP's PA-RISC chips and Intel's Itanium. "HP recognizes the work required and has put in place an engineering plan with the necessary resources that is now executing on the commitments made by the firm," said HP watcher Terry Shannon, who reported the software moves in his Shannon Knows HPC newsletter. HP will release the clustering and file system software for HP-UX in the second half of 2004, the HP representative said. The company plans to support eight to 16 nodes initially and hundreds eventually. Moving Tru64 features to HP-UX is important in order to retain existing HP-UX customers and to encourage Tru64 customers to stay in the HP fold rather than defect to Unix competitors such as Sun Microsystems or IBM. Sun recently launched an "HP Away" program to lure Tru64 customers. Under the program, Sun is offering trade-in deals, two weeks of free consulting and the ability to defer payment for as much as 90 days until the migration is completed.
2008-03-17 - HP turns ProLiant up to 8  With the ProLiant DL785 G5 Server, Hewlett-Packard has re-entered the 8-socket x86 server space. This system has twice the computing headroom of the quad-processor servers that are generally considered at the top end of the volume or so-called commodity server space. HP isn't new to this market segment. In 1997, Intel bought a company by the name of Corollary that was in the process of developing a chipset that effectively "glued together" two standard quad-processor x86 busses into a single 8-way symmetrical multiprocessor (SMP). Intel not only completed development, it also gave the chipset legitimacy by giving it an Intel blaze. Then Microsoft provided the last major missing piece with Windows 2000, an OS that not only showed real progress in reliability and scalability over its predecessors, but also lent credibility to Microsoft's efforts to be perceived as a serious OS vendor for serious servers. ProLiant, initially as a Compaq server brand and then after its acquisition by HP, used this chipset and its successors for a succession of server products--even after Intel decided to stop contributing to further development. (Intel had, at various points, planned to do a Xeon version of Itanium's 870 chipset, but this never ended up happening.) Compaq's own version, the "ProLiant F8" chipset, adapted Profusion for the architecture and bus speeds associated with newer Intel processors, but did not fundamentally alter the design. (Subscribers can read about more of the historical background here.) However, HP eventually decided to pull the plug on in-house development of 8-way chipsets for Xeon. I've broached the question "Why?" with HP executives on a number of occasions over the past few years and their responses have been pretty consistent. They've boiled down to two basic rationales: The size of the 8-socket market does not justify the expense associated with custom chipset development. To the degree that there's a demand for larger ProLiants, it's mostly from customers wanting to run larger Microsoft SQL Server databases and associated enterprise applications--and those needs can be met by Windows running on HP Integrity (Itanium-based) servers. So what's changed to bring ProLiant back into this space? From my perspective, there's probably not one single reason but rather a few different factors that collectively served the needle from "No" to "Yes." It's easier. Rather than using Intel processors, the ProLiant DL785 G5 uses Advanced Micro Devices Opteron "Barcelona" quad-core processors. Unlike Xeons, the AMD processors can support up to 8-socket servers without the use of special server vendor-developed chips. A lot of effort (and therefore money) still goes into designing, qualifying, and supporting a system in this class. However, the costs associated with primarily integrating existing in-house and third-party components and technologies are still much less than if bespoke chipset design is added to the mix. The market is larger. Dual-socket servers still make up the bulk of server unit sales. However, server virtualization, in particular, has kicked demand for larger boxes, which once seemed to be on an inevitable slide, up a notch. Server virtualization allows as many workloads (more or less) to run on a system as processor, memory, and I/O capacity can support. Given this, many users are starting to think that they're better off consolidating onto larger servers than smaller ones. This reduces the number of physical boxes to manage. In addition, larger servers often come with a more sophisticated array of reliability and management features. The market for scale-up x86 servers isn't going away either--for reasons including the increasing sophistication of Microsoft SQL Server or the growth of Solaris on x86. Integrity is only a partial solution. From HP's perspective, the "buy Itanium" message was always logical enough. Most of the critical high-end Windows applications were available and Integrity, after all, was specifically optimized for that space. It's a good story, but the reality is that a lot of Windows customers don't want to support multiple processor architectures in their environments--even if the software is (mostly) the same. As a final point, the HP of today is a tightly managed and highly measured organization. And ProLiant is clearly one of the growth stars. Thus, it's not hard to imagine that politely leaving high-end Windows opportunities to Integrity came to be regarded as sub-optimal from the perspective of HP as a whole. Whatever the precise balance of reasons, HP is back in the 8-socket Xeon game. It's a space that HP has largely ceded to IBM's X4 designs. Now HP is re-engaging aggressively as they did with blades and as they've done across so much of the x86 space.
2002-07-08 - HP touts advantages of Itanium 2   Hewlett-Packard formally detailed its plans for the Itanium 2 processor on Monday, a key step in HP's strategy to take on IBM and Sun. HP, which co-designed the chip, announced a wide variety of Itanium 2 products, including lower-end two- and four-processor systems that will ship in August, options to upgrade existing servers with the new chip, and eventually a mammoth machine with 128 Itanium processors. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company also released benchmarks touting the price/performance advantages of the new chip, which analysts say back up some of the promises made by Intel and HP about the chip. "Itanium has now crossed the threshold to compete on par and in some cases to compete with an advantage," said Giga Information Group analyst Brad Day. For example, on the widely used TPC-C test that simulates inventory transactions with a computerized warehouse, an HP rx5670 server with four Itanium 2 processors has a score of 78,000, bettering 55,000 of the IBM x440 system with four Xeon MP processors. The Itanium system also costs less. Itanium 2 is a key point in HP's strategy to simplify its multiple hardware and software lines while competing with IBM and Sun Microsystems. The processors are used in high-powered workstations and in servers, networked machines for jobs such as keeping track of corporate product sales. Currently, HP uses its own chips, the PA-RISC family, in these products now. Switching to Itanium is expected to help HP, the theory goes, by cutting down independent research and development. The first Itanium had lopsided performance, doing well only on technical jobs such as physics simulations, but Itanium 2 expands into the much larger market for business software such as SAP's accounting software or tasks that require databases such as Microsoft's SQL Server. "It wasn't until release of benchmarks by HP and Microsoft around SAP and SQL Server 2000 that we believed the Itanium 2 architecture had the balance to be aggressive both on technical and commercial computing," Day said. The performance of the new processor family is key for HP in particular as the company places most of its eggs in the Itanium basket. IBM is backing Itanium but heavily investing in its own Power processors, while Sun is pushing its UltraSparc processors while grudgingly adopting low-end 32-bit Intel chips. By contrast, HP will not only adopt Itanium family chips into its machines that compete against Sun and IBM boxes, the company will also eventually insert the chip into the superhigh-end NonStop machines that it acquired in the Compaq Computer merger. Eventually, HP will support five operating systems on the new processor: Windows, Linux, and three of its own products, HP-UX, OpenVMS and NonStop Kernel. Itanium is a 64-bit chip, giving it the ability to easily address vast swathes of memory that 32-bit chips such as Intel's Pentium and Xeon can't manage. It also has capabilities for transferring information to and from memory more swiftly, features for accelerating data encryption, and improvements for working in large multiprocessor systems. "In the longer term, we see it as a two-horse race--us and IBM," said Mark Hudson, worldwide manager for business critical systems at HP, in an interview. Sun views HP as vulnerable during the transition to Itanium since it will have to persuade customers to dramatically change their software. HP gives short shrift to discussing "the risks, complexities and costs required to recertify, recompile and retest applications for their Itanium 2 products--if equivalent applications for Itanium 2 are available at all," the company said in a statement. As long as they're making a change, customers will find it easier and cheaper to move from HP and Compaq servers to Sun servers, Sun said. And in an earlier interview the head of Sun's microprocessor group criticized Itanium as a design that dates from outmoded 1970s concepts. Itanium requires that many computing tasks execute in parallel, but in practice it's very difficult for software to detect that parallelism and keep all parts of the processor fed with data and instructions, said David Yen, promoted this week to be Sun's executive vice president for processor and network security products. And performance isn't the only issue. Itanium now faces the challenge of rounding up sufficient support from software companies that the systems are actually useful. "I think from now on, it's a matter of growing the list of applications," Day said. HP and Intel have a joint program called "Velocity" to hasten software companies' Itanium support and to help customers test their own software. Sun, with a prestigious list of business partners, is the company to beat when it comes to software support for higher-end servers. The company benefited from the growing use of Unix servers that were more powerful and reliable than Windows systems but less expensive than IBM's mainframes. HP is also working to improve its Itanium hardware as well as software. While Intel is designing the processor, HP is taking responsibility for much of the rest of the system, including the all-important chipset that links the processor to memory and input-output devices such as network cards or storage systems. HP's chipset, zx1, is used in its two-processor rx2600 server, its four-processor rx5670 server, its one-processor zx2000 workstation and its two-processor zx6000 workstation. All the systems can be ordered now but won't begin shipping until August, HP said. The rx2600 has an average price of $16,000; the rx5670 costs $38,000; the zx2000 costs $6,000; and the zx6000 costs $13,000, HP said. The zx1, code-named Pluto, is one of a host of new chipsets designed to wire Itanium 2 systems. Other chipsets include IBM's Enterprise X Architecture "Summit," Intel's E8870, Hitachi's ColdFusion-2, and other products from SGI, NEC, Unisys and Bull. But HP has other plans in the pipeline through its "Pinnacles" chipset that will power servers with eight, 16, 32, 64 and eventually 128 Itanium processors. In 2003, HP will provide Pinnacles-based upgrades to its existing PA-RISC servers, all the way up to its 64-processor top-end Superdome system, said Brian Cox, product line manager of HP's Business Critical Systems. Also in 2003, HP will release its Superdome sequel with 128 PA-RISC processors. Then, at the end of 2003 or the beginning of 2004, the company will release a 128-processor Superdome with Itanium processors. Though HP's entire PA-RISC line can be upgraded with the Itanium processors, the Itanium and PA-RISC processors can't coexist in the same server, Cox said. In contrast, Sun's higher-end servers can accommodate different speeds of today's UltraSparc III processors and next-generation UltraSparc IV processors.
2004-02-06 - HP to unveil new Itanium Unix servers  Hewlett-Packard is expected to announce its new PA-8800 processor and an accompanying Unix server line Monday, as well as a new system built with Intel?s Itanium 2 for technical computing, according to sources. Ultimately, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based computing company will have a simpler product line as it gradually phases out the PA-RISC chips and moves to Itanium for its more powerful servers. But for the next few years, HP is contending with multiple blood lines for its high-end systems--and with low-end systems complicated by the arrival of new 64-bit chips from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. News.context What's new: HP is expected to announce a new PA-8800 processor and accompanying Unix server line Monday, along with an Itanium 2 system for technical computing, sources say. Bottom line: Ultimately, HP will have a simpler product line as it phases out the PA-RISC chips and moves to Itanium. But for the next few years, it must contend with multiple blood lines for its high-end systems--and with 64-bit complications on the low end. More stories on this topic Sources said HP plans to announce a broad suite of PA-8800-based servers Monday, including a new version of the top-of-the-line Superdome. Last year, HP predicted that its top-end PA-8800-based 128-processor Superdome would debut by early 2004. The PA-8800 combines two PA-8700 chips onto a single slice of silicon, boosting the processing performance that can be plugged into a single socket. On the Itanium front, sources said HP plans to introduce the rx1600, a system with dual 1GHz Itanium 2 "Deerfield" processors, a low-voltage model that uses less power and produces less waste heat than other Itaniums. The rack-mounted system, just 1.75 inches thick, is geared for high-performance technical computing, where clusters of such servers are linked to solve computing challenges. In addition, HP is bringing new lower-priced Itanium processors to the existing rx2600 line, a 3.5-inch-thick dual-processor server. The system now is available with 1GHz and 1.4GHz Itanium 2 processors, with prices starting at $5,730 and $6,230, according to HP's Web site. No Opteron appearance One future server line won't be making an appearance Monday, though: a model using AMD's 64-bit Opteron processor. Opteron's AMD64 architecture has blurred a major distinction between the "x86" family of chips such as Intel's 32-bit Xeon and the 64-bit Itanium. HP is expected to announce those servers later this month. Intel is following suit with its own 64-bit extensions, formerly called Yamhill but now called CT, which is short for Clackamas Technology, according to sources. Intel expects to demonstrate the technology and unveil an official name at its Intel Developer Forum later in February, sources said. HP believes Opteron and CT are a comparatively minor addition to x86 designs. Mark Hudson, vice president of marketing for HP's Enterprise Storage and Servers group, called the 64-bit extensions "a natural evolution of that architecture...It's no different from x86 having other enhancements." Hudson declined to comment on plans to ship x86 servers with 64-bit extensions beyond saying that the company will ship them when customers want them, and that it will be best for the computer makers, software companies and customers if Intel's 64-bit extensions are compatible with AMD's. Others see the changes at Intel and HP as more dramatic. "If Intel's Itanium plans (or) efforts slow due to a greater thrust on x86/64-bit efforts, it could have a negative impact on HP's efforts to improve profitability in its enterprise business," Bear Stearns analyst Andrew Neff wrote in a Thursday report. And the fact that HP has said it's exploring 64-bit x86 options is "stunning," Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice said in a research note Tuesday. "If Intel's most important...customer--the long-term leader in x86 servers, the one that helped co-develop Itanium and has spent years being its standard-bearer--if this company would even consider Opteron, then AMD64 clearly presents a strategic threat to Intel." Itanium still central HP may be making room for new x86 chips in its ProLiant line, but the company expects, and Intel promises, major improvements for Itanium. One next-generation model, code-named Tukwila, includes a design with as many as 16 processor cores on one slice of silicon. And Intel expects Itanium prices to drop. The Itanium processor was a driving force behind the merger of HP and Compaq Computer. Like HP, Compaq planned to phase out its own high-end chip, Alpha, in favor of Itanium. Compaq's exotic NonStop servers, which use MIPS processors today, will begin moving to Itanium in early 2005, Hudson said--a slight delay over the 2004 deadline HP set in 2002. "When you look at our strategy, it's going down from five architectures to two," Hudson said. "Our plans aren't changing. We'll support two key industry-standard architectures in the long term," referring to Itanium and x86. Itanium hasn't been as successful as Intel once hoped; market researcher IDC in January lowered its Itanium server sales forecast to $7.5 billion for 2007. But analysts praise the chip's performance, and it's featured in servers from Dell, IBM, NEC, Fujitsu, Hitachi and others. For now, HP Unix server sales are "much more heavily weighted on the PA-RISC side," said Michael Haley, the vice president for the division of Arrow Electronics that distributes HP servers to resellers. "I still say we're in the early adoption stage" with Itanium systems, he said, but noted that he expects a major increase in sales in the second half of 2004. Itanium gives HP more software flexibility. Where the PA-based servers can run only HP's version of Unix, called HP-UX, the Itanium-based Integrity server line also can run Linux and Microsoft's Windows. Later this year, HP plans to release Itanium versions of less widely used operating systems, OpenVMS and NonStop Kernel. There now are 1,500 software applications that will run on HP-UX for Itanium, Hudson said. Also on Monday, HP will make an early release of OpenVMS available to developers and early adopters, Hudson said. The penultimate PA-8800 The PA-8800 processor, code-named Mako, is the second-to-last of HP's Precision Architecture line. Its "dual-core" approach is the same as the one IBM took with its existing Power4 processor, and Sun Microsystems is taking with its UltraSparc IV, expected to star in Sun's product launch on Tuesday. Sun, HP and IBM describe their chips in different ways. Where HP and IBM count a dual-core chip as two processors on a single slice of silicon, Sun looks at its dual-core UltraSparc IV as a single chip that can execute two simultaneous instruction sequences, called "threads." Intel plans a dual-core Itanium, but HP is moving one step faster. Through a technology called mx2, HP will be able to insert two Itanium processors into one Itanium socket. The mx2 technology, code-named Hondo, had been scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2004, but more recent HP schedules now put the release date in the second half of the year.
2005-10-28 - HP to unveil Itanium blades next week  Hewlett-Packard is expected to announce its first blade servers that use Intel's Itanium processor on Tuesday, sources familiar with the product plans said. HP is currently the second-place blade seller after IBM, and together the companies account for the lion's share of shipments and revenue for the thin servers. Right now, one difference between their products is that IBM's Power processor-based blade can run the company's version of Unix, AIX, but HP's machine can't run its own take on the operating system. That will change with HP's Itanium blades, which can run the HP-UX version of Unix. Itanium-based computers also can run Linux and Microsoft Windows. Blade servers are slim machines that slide side-by-side into a chassis that supplies common power, cooling and networking infrastructure. Server makers are interested in the market as a way to stand above the common herd of mainstream servers and to tap into a business that's growing 10 times faster than the overall server market. In the second quarter of 2005, blade server revenue grew 49 percent to $419 million compared with the overall server market's 4.7 percent growth to $12.2 billion, according to Gartner research. Most blade servers use x86 processors, such as Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron, which both IBM and HP use in their blade servers. Rival Dell sells Xeon-based blades, and Sun Microsystems, the fourth major server maker, plans to release Opteron-based blades in coming months. HP, based in Palo Alto, Calif., declined to comment. However, in 2004, the company said it expected Itanium blades in mid-2005. HP initiated the chip project that became Itanium and helped Intel develop early models. The next Itanium, a dual-core chip code-named Montecito, has been delayed until mid-2006.
2004-11-18 - HP to tout Itanium SAP customers   More than 180 Hewlett-Packard customers running SAP's business software have moved their systems to HP servers with Intel's Itanium processor since May, the company plans to announce Thursday. HP is moving all its server lines to Itanium and has broken performance records with its Itanium-based Integrity products, but the processor hasn't met Intel's goals. The customers include Texas State University, South Korea's Asiana Airlines, Bharat Forge in India, the Body Shop in the U.K., Industrias Metalurgicas Unidas in Colombia, Koehler Group in Germany, Linfox in Australia, Pilsner Urquell in the Czech Republic, Telefonica de Espana in Spain, the Florida Department of Revenue, India's Sundaram Clayton and Volvo IT in Sweden.
2003-04-18 - HP to sharpen blade with Pentium M Revisiting the early days of blade servers, Hewlett-Packard will use Intel's Pentium M processor, designed for mobile computers, in a new slim server expected early in the third quarter. HP will upgrade its ProLiant BL10e blade server with a 1GHz Pentium M, a processor code-named "Banias" that should boost performance over the current 900MHz ultra-low-voltage Pentium III used in the current product, Sally Stevens, director of blade servers for HP's Industry Standard Server group, said in an interview. The Pentium M comes with 1MB of high-speed cache memory rather than the 512KB in the Pentium III and supports faster double data rate (DDR) memory. "There's a nice opportunity for enhanced performance," Stevens said. Keeping momentum in the Intel server market is crucial for HP, which acquired Compaq Computer in 2002, in part for the ProLiant line. HP had the biggest fraction of the $16.4 billion market for servers using Intel or Intel-compatible processors in 2002, but IBM and Dell Computer are gaining, and even Intel-phobic Sun Microsystems has entered the fray with its own Intel servers. In addition, by the end of April, HP will ship an upgraded dual-processor blade, the BL20p, that includes 3.06GHz Xeon processors instead of the 2.8GHz currently used, Stevens said. The new processor includes a 533MHz front-side bus--the connection between the chip and its memory--compared with the 400MHz predecessor. The new BL10e harkens back to the earliest days of blade servers, systems that fit side by side into a single chassis with shared gear such as power supplies and network connections. Those first systems, pioneered by start-ups such as RLX Technologies, used technology lifted from laptops to keep power consumption low so servers can be packed densely without overheating. "This is the low-power-consumption, high-density blade idea redux," said Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice. Those first models were spawned in an era when spending was flush for Internet infrastructure such as the low-end servers that host Web sites. Adjusting to curtailed corporate computing spending for such products, IBM, Dell and HP shifted plans to blades that pack more punch with two and in some cases four of the more powerful Xeon processors. Even RLX now has introduced dual-Xeon blades. Sun, which specializes in Unix servers, is taking a different approach. Its first blades will house one of Sun's UltraSparc processors. Later models will use Athlon chips from Advanced Micro Devices and possibly other Intel-compatible processors, with dual-processor models planned for both chip families. Fast enough The new Banias blade from HP won't outperform Xeon machines, but it likely will outrun the single-processor competition, Eunice said. "Consider what it's competing against--other Pentium III designs, the even more modestly powered Transmeta Crusoe, or Sun blades running at just 650MHz," Eunice said. "Though it's not going to impress going up against the heavyweight multiprocessor Xeon blades, Pentium M fits pretty nicely among the blade crowd." IBM plans single-processor blade models, Intel server Chief Technology Officer Tom Bradicich told News.com in March, but an IBM representative said Friday that those models will use Xeon processors, not the Pentium M. Processors that consume less power is an option in the future, but customers aren't asking for it now, and Big Blue is currently happy with Xeon's balance of price and performance. Dell declined to comment on its plans. Low-end uniprocessor blades are still good for many network tasks, such as handing out Internet addresses to PCs as they log onto a network, serving up Web pages or directing Web surfers' computers to the proper addresses as they browse the Internet, said Paul Miller, director of platforms for HP's Industry Standard Server group. Some early blades built with laptop technology, including those using laptop processors from Transmeta, were missing one feature important feature demanded in the server world: error-correcting code that can fix some occasional mix-ups when ones and zeros are being transmitted on and off the chip. Newer blades fix this problem. HP has shipped about 20,000 blades since January 2002, when the BL10e was launched. Roughly two-thirds of those were BL10e models, but now that the dual-processor BL20p and four-processor BL40p are shipping, some momentum is shifting to the higher-end models. More than 50 percent of blades are shipping with an optional network switch embedded, Stevens said, with a higher rate for the two- and four-processor machines. And more than 80 percent are using HP's Remote Deployment Pack, a utility that makes it easier to install software on large numbers of servers. IBM plans to have Unix blades using its Power processors for the second half of 2003, and HP is considering a similar Unix move with Intel's 64-bit Itanium chips. "We're still looking at when the right time is to introduce that architecture," Miller said. "We think we're on a very strong path to do this." Key to making the move will be further customer demand and unified software management tools so that Itanium blades and 32-bit Intel blades can coexist easily in the same chassis, he said.
2005-01-14 - HP to rejuvenate OpenVMS on Monday Hewlett-Packard plans to inject some new life--or more accurately, a new processor--into its venerable OpenVMS operating system on Monday, CNET News.com has learned. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based computer and printer company is launching version 8.2 of the operating system, which for the first time will bring OpenVMS to Itanium processors, sources familiar with the plan said. The announcement will accompany a refreshed Itanium server product line that HP will trumpet during a Webcast with Chief Executive Carly Fiorina on Tuesday. With the launch, HP will seek to retain historically loyal customers who today are prime targets for competitors such as IBM and Sun Microsystems. HP is vulnerable because its OpenVMS customers face a major hardware and software transition: HP is phasing out the Alpha processor that is the primary foundation for OpenVMS today. The debut of OpenVMS 8.2 will mean that a fourth operating system can run simultaneously on the same Itanium server alongside Windows, Linux and HP's version of Unix, called HP-UX. HP is expected to launch new pricing and joint support plans Monday to make that mixture easier. HP declined to comment on its OpenVMS launch plans. OpenVMS for Itanium will come with many of the abilities of the Alpha version--in particular a famed reliability feature called clustering that links separate machines into a tightly knit group. One machine in a cluster can fill in for another that's taken down for equipment failure or an upgrade, for example. Itanium baggage But the new OpenVMS version also will come with some of the baggage of Itanium. The Intel processor family had a late and troubled debut, still isn't meeting Intel's shipment goals, and faces competition from chip families including IBM's Power and Sun's UltraSparc. HP initiated the Itanium project but gradually transferred all engineers to Intel. While other companies sell servers with the chip, HP remains Itanium's most ardent supporter. Itanium's troubled debut has given pause to Jess Goodman, VMS systems manager at AccuWeather, who runs 34 VMS systems to process information sent to the company's weather Web site. "Certainly I'm a little bit worried about how Itanium hasn't turned into Intel's flagship as we had hoped," Goodman said. "I'm somewhat concerned about the future of VMS if there's no good hardware to run it on. If no one is buying Itanium, will there be enough research and development money to keep them competitive with other chips?" Goodman is keeping his eyes on Itanium, but so far, "We haven't seen anything yet that's making me want to go," he said. But others are more excited. "We are looking forward to it," said Jack Steinman, vice president of information services for Aurora, a nonprofit organization that runs more than 250 hospitals, clinics and other health care facilities in eastern Wisconsin. Aurora needs expanded computing power that the Itanium systems will provide, and will upgrade once its software suppliers test and certify their Itanium versions, he said. Cost will be an argument to go to the new systems, said Jim Custer, director of HP server product marketing for Avnet, a major HP partner that distributes and resells OpenVMS and other servers. "In the long run, running infrastructure on Itanium is going to be much less expensive on Itanium than Alpha--both the initial acquisition (cost) and ongoing maintenance and support," Custer said. Even with a new low-price OpenVMS edition coming, though, HP doesn't appear to be trying hard to attract new buyers, Custer said. "Their primary goal is to protect the installed base and make sure the customer has an adequate roadmap. Gaining net new (customers) may be secondary at this point," he said. Storied past OpenVMS began its life in 1977 as VMS, the operating system that powered Digital Equipment Corp.'s once-dominant VAX computers. DEC's so-called minicomputers unseated mainframes, but Unix servers and the powerful RISC (reduced instruction set computing) processors later turned the tables on the VAX machines. DEC embraced RISC and Unix, but it wasn't enough: Compaq Computer acquired DEC in 1998. But Compaq also decided not to go it alone, and HP acquired the company--along with OpenVMS--in 2002. When HP bought Compaq, OpenVMS "was probably one of the close calls when they decided what was going to move forward and what projects they were going to cancel, simply because OpenVMS is clearly for legacy systems," said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. "When (administrators of) legacy systems are faced with a transition, they are going to look at other alternatives." But presumably, HP did the math and decided the investment was worthwhile--unlike the conclusion it reached with its largely phased-out HP 3000 line. The OpenVMS business was profitable in 2003, but HP declined to state whether it is today, citing investor regulations. Sun is one company that would like to lure OpenVMS customers. But the company doesn't plan a high-profile campaign such as its HP Away program to convert HP-UX customers, said Larry Singer, vice president of Sun's global information systems strategy office. "I don't see the compelling market event to cause people to go running away from that platform. It's more of a slow slide into the horizon," Singer said. Sun will try to pick up customers who aren't satisfied with HP's support or who are paring down the types of servers in their data centers, though. At HP, "it is very clear that OpenVMS is not a strategic operating system and Alpha is not a strategic platform." It's not surprising why competitors are pouncing. In August 2003, well after HP announced it would maintain OpenVMS after the Compaq merger, a survey by an HP user group called Encompass found that 42 percent of 569 HP customers planned future OpenVMS purchases, but half that--21 percent--did not. HP isn't the only one seeking to rejuvenate a stalwart product line. IBM has updated its iSeries--long called AS/400 and another decades-old family--with its new Power5 processor. The same IBM Power machine now can run Linux, IBM's AIX version of Unix and the iSeries operating system, i5/OS. The multi-OS playing card And like IBM with Power, HP is expected to tout Itanium's ability to run multiple operating systems. "It gives a customer flexibility," said Avnet's Custer. "As they plan for growth or a transition of their business, they can take that infrastructure and redeploy it elsewhere." For Accuweather's Goodman, the multi-operating system ability makes it easier to free up purchasing dollars for OpenVMS systems. "It holds appeal for management," which likes the argument that the company can use the server for Windows later. "I want a box for VMS. They say they're not sure we'll be using VMS in five years. They've been saying that for 20 years," Goodman said. Another company intrigued by the multi-operating system abilities of Itanium is Cerner, a major HP partner that sells health care software called Millennium--30 million lines of code and 56 modules for tasks such as recording patient information, logging pharmacy orders and billing insurance companies. Cerner sells its software along with either HP's Alpha-based hardware running OpenVMS or IBM's Power-based hardware running AIX, but the company has begun investigating using Linux on those servers, too. "We are seeing more (customers) that are asking specifically about Linux," said Mike Nill, vice president of technical architecture at Cerner. "We can run Linux on the IBM boxes and the Itanium boxes. We're starting some initial research-and-development work there." Cerner has been working closely with HP to translate the OpenVMS version of its software to Itanium, but the software isn't ready yet, Nill said. "There's some more time to get fully certified on the technology. It's in the relatively near future," he said. OpenVMS 8.2 features HP is expected to release three versions of OpenVMS 8.2, said Terry Shannon, longtime OpenVMS watcher and author of the Shannon Knows High Performance Computing newsletter. The Foundation level will be for low-end use and price-sensitive customers; the Enterprise level will sport better reliability, management tools and performance; and the Mission-Critical level will feature support for clustering. OpenVMS 8.2 supports clusters of as many as 16 machines--up to eight Alpha-based and up to eight Itanium-based in the same group, a source familiar with the software said. HP also is expected to introduce per-processor licensing for OpenVMS, letting customers pay for the amount of computing horsepower they're using instead of today's pricing based on the capability of the entire system. The move dovetails with HP's Adaptive Enterprise initiative to better link a customer's computing infrastructure with its business priorities. Support for the operating system initially will be available on lower-end Itanium servers ranging from the dual-processor rx1600 to the four-processor rx4640. A key requirement for customers to make the move to Itanium will be new versions of their software, though HP offers a migration tool that eases the change even when the software's original source code isn't available. There will be 250 OpenVMS applications available for Itanium by the end of February and 800 in 2005, HP said. That compares with 3,000 for other Itanium operating systems--roughly 1,500 for HP-UX and 750 each for Windows and Linux.
2004-12-16 - HP to make 3 billion Itanium commitment    Hewlett-Packard may have transferred its last remaining Itanium processor engineers to Intel, but the server maker is standing by the technology to the tune of $3 billion. The funds will help HP design systems and encourage software companies during the next three years, the computer maker plans to announce Thursday. HP will spend money to recruit software companies to Itanium and help them optimize and market their products for Itanium. HP and Intel, which co-developed the Itanium chip family for more than a decade, initially declined to comment on the agreement to transfer HP's chip designers to Intel, but late Wednesday HP confirmed and detailed the plan. "Several hundred" engineers in HP's Fort Collins, Colo., operation will move to Intel, "bolstering the development of multicore, multithreaded processors." Those technologies let a single processor perform more tasks simultaneously. The companies with the prime Itanium rivals--Sun Microsystems, IBM, Advanced Micro Devices--all are headed that direction as well. HP isn't shedding all its Itanium expertise. It will continue to design chipsets, the crucial chips that connect processors to memory, network, storage and other subsystems. HP is in midst of a years-long process of phasing out its own PA-RISC processor design in favor of Itanium, with which the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company employs a fundamental design that will outlast rivals. However, HP and Itanium have faced tough challenges getting Itanium to catch on. The Itanium allies once hoped Itanium would conquer the server landscape, but have scaled back ambitions to the relatively modest goal of competing against IBM's Power and Sun's UltraSparc that employ the reduced instruction set computing (RISC) approach. HP's investment is designed to "vault Intel Itanium 2-based HP Integrity servers to the leadership position in the $20 billion market currently served by RISC processors," HP said in a statement. "As HP and Intel continue to invest in server innovation and Itanium, Integrity servers become a 'must have' competitive weapon to drive customer value for the next decade and beyond," Chief Executive Carly Fiorina said in the statement. One of the chief stumbling blocks in Intel's Itanium plans has been the popularity of its Xeon processors, close cousins of the Pentium line. These x86 chips, unlike Itanium, are able to easily run a vast collection of software. AMD threw another wrench in the Itanium works with 64-bit x86 memory extensions in 2003, which along with a similar move by Intel in 2004 undermined one of the advantages Itanium had over x86 chips.
2002-10-25 - HP to double up Itanium chips  Beginning in 2004, Hewlett-Packard will pair up future Itanium chips so twice the number can be shoehorned into a computer. The plans, which apply to the next-generation "Madison" and "Montecito" models in Intel's Itanium chip line, illustrate that Hewlett-Packard is able to expand on the basic processors that Intel offers, decreasing its reliance on the chipmaker. Processors are the single most important component of HP's future servers. HP Chief Technology Officer Shane Robison discussed the products Wednesday at an analyst conference, arguing that the double-whammy chips will enable HP processors to leapfrog the performance of IBM's Power processor family. IBM's current Power4 processor was the first "dual-core" server chip, taking advantage of an approach in which two processors are etched into a single slice of silicon. HP, Intel and Sun Microsystems are pursuing their own dual-core chips, but HP wanted something that worked like an actual dual-core Itanium earlier than Intel plans to release one. HP plans to use this dual-chip packaging technology--in which two separate processors share the same data pathway connecting them to the rest of a computer--from low-end to high-end systems, said John Miller, director of HP server marketing. "We feel it's important to be in the marketplace with a dual-core implementation, even though it's not exactly that," Miller said. "Everybody in the industry is going to be there." Intel plans to make dual-core Itanium processors by "the middle of the decade," Mike Fister, general manager of Intel's Enterprise Platforms Group, said in September. Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP developed the idea behind the Itanium processors, but Intel is taking the lead in the designing and building of the chips. HP has begun moving all its server lines to the Itanium family, and the double-chip packages will permit the company to offer more powerful servers, sooner. "What that gets them is the ability to take any platform they design and put twice as many processors in it as they otherwise would have been able to," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. "It's very impressive." Building extremely powerful Itanium servers sends a signal to prospective buyers that HP is serious about the product, but high-end Itanium servers aren't expected to be in widespread use anytime soon. The chips require software to be overhauled before it will work well on the new systems, and customers are conservative about making radical changes to servers that run critical tasks such as reconciling bank balances. HP's Unix servers currently use the company's own PA-RISC processors, but they are designed to accommodate Itanium processors as well. The company's high-end Superdome server now can accommodate 64 PA-RISC chips, but a version coming in 2003 with the new PA-RISC 8800 processors will use 128 of them. The double-Itanium plan will be the way HP builds 128-processor Itanium systems as well, Miller said. Intel said it will begin selling its "Madison" version of Itanium 2 next year, with "Montecito" scheduled to debut in 2004. In early 2004, HP plans to sell its "Madison Module," which pairs two Madison processors with some high-speed "cache" memory. The cache, which can supply information more quickly than the computer's main memory, compensates for the fact that two processors will be sharing one data pathway designed for a single chip. In late 2004, HP will begin selling a "Montecito Module" as well, applying the same technique to the next Madison successor. HP won't make the modules available to other companies building Itanium servers, Miller said. Current Itanium 2 "McKinley" processors, Madison and Montecito have the same connection technology and power requirements, allowing a computer with one to be upgraded with a newer model. To make HP's Madison and Montecito double-chip modules consume only as much power as a single chip, HP likely will throttle back the chips' clock speeds, Brookwood said.
2002-04-16 - HP to build Linux supercomputer    Hewlett-Packard announced a high-profile contract Tuesday to build a Linux-powered supercomputer for the U.S. Department of Energy. The $24.5 million supercomputer will be capable of processing 8.3 trillion calculations per second (8.3 teraflops), according to HP. That would place the system among the current top 10 of the world's fastest supercomputers, if it were operating today. HP expects to have the supercomputer running at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash., early next year. The supercomputer will be used for biological and environmental research, including genomics work, at the laboratory's Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL). While supercomputers aren't big revenue producers for PC makers, they are valuable for bragging rights and credibility in high-end business systems. IBM has long been the leader in supercomputing projects, but Sun Microsystems and presumptive HP spouse Compaq Computer have snagged major projects in the past year. "This demonstrates to the world there is more than one top player in the high-performance computing space," Martin Fink, general manager of HP's Linux Systems Operation, said in a conference call after the announcement. The project, which will create the world's most powerful Linux computer, is also seen as a coup for the open-source operating system, although lab officials said they weren't particularly motivated by OS choice. "Hardware performance was the determining factor for us," said Dave Dixon, associate director of theory, modeling and simulation at EMSL. The supercomputer will be powered by 1,400 Intel processors based on the chipmaker's high-end Itanium design. The chips will be a 4-to-1 mix of Madison, the third-generation version of Itanium, to be released next year, and the upcoming second-generation McKinley. The HP supercomputer will replace an outdated IBM system installed at the laboratory in 1997.
2002-06-19 - HP to boost NonStop performance    A new top-end NonStop servers that Hewlett-Packard plans to announce Wednesday will run 50 percent faster than the current model, and the company also plans a new "premium" model that's 90 percent faster, a source familiar with the plan said. In addition, HP plans to boost its NonStop line with faster and expanded software, the company is expected to announce. Software plans include improvements to run Java programs as much as 20 percent faster, faster database software and support for some technologies at the heart of the Web services effort to create a new generation of business services on the Internet. HP's NonStop servers, acquired through the merger with Compaq Computer, run ultra-demanding jobs such as the New York, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo stock exchanges, and Bank of America's automated-teller machine network. NonStop servers generally cost more than $1 million. HP's ability to integrate the NonStop products is viewed as a litmus test for the Compaq integration effort, especially given that Compaq had difficulties melding the NonStop products into its own business when it acquired Tandem Computers 1997. Software features such as Java and Web services, used widely across many server lines, are key to the effort to advance the NonStop line and keep it relevant, rather than letting it become a niche product that is unable to keep pace with modern programming trends. Web services features coming with the new products include support for Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Extensible Markup Language (XML). Scott Stallard, general manager of HP's Business Critical Systems group and Pauline Nist, general manager of the NonStop Enterprise Division, plan to announce the products on Wednesday. HP declined to comment on the products. The current top-end NonStop S74000 server, which uses SGI's R12000 processor, will be supplanted by the R14000-based S76000. The S76000 also supports up to 16GB of memory per processor, compared with 4GB for the S74000, and has connections to memory and between processors. The new "premium" line will begin with the S86000, which is similar to the S76000, although each processor has 8MB of high-speed "cache" memory, compared with the 4MB in the S76000, the source said. The improvements will make the S86000 up to 90 percent faster than the S74000 and the S76000 up to 50 percent faster. The S76000 and S86000 models are shipping now, but a telecommunications-market-specific S86000SE, that has the ability to withstand fire, smoke and cold temperatures, will ship in the fourth quarter. HP introduces new products based on the forthcoming R16000 and R18000 processors, the source said. In 2004 and 2005, the first and second models based on Intel's Itanium processor will arrive. HP calls the 2004 premium Itanium systems i2T, to be replaced by the i4T in 2005. In the lower end of the product line, the i2S and i2M in 2004 will be joined by the i4S and i4M in 2005.
2004-01-26 - HP to adopt AMD's Opteron in servers   Hewlett-Packard plans to come out with servers that contain Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron processor, another significant win for AMD. Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP is expected to insert chips into ProLiant servers that contain one to four processors, sources said. The announcement will take place in February, but the servers may not be released commercially for a while, sources said. The Opteron chip, which debuted last April, has allowed Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD to move from the fringes of the lucrative corporate computing market toward the center. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a regular Enterprise Hardware column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. IBM has come out with servers and workstations using the chip. Meanwhile Sun Microsystems has said it will come out with servers containing the chip and port its Solaris operating system to it later this year. With HP, AMD will have design contracts will three of the world's four largest server makers. Dell, which uses only Intel chips in its computers, is the notable holdout. Large server manufacturers concentrating in European and Asian markets have also adopted the chip. "It (Opteron) is an inexpensive way to build a high-performance server," Gartner analyst Martin Reynolds said. The deal could be seen as a setback for Intel. One of the chief features of Opteron is that it can run 32-bit software, which is now found on desktops and Intel/AMD servers, as well as 64-bit versions of the same applications and OSes. The 64-bit computers can handle more memory and are used to run databases and other ornate applications. As a result, the chip lets IT managers install more powerful computers without changing their software base substantially. AMD declined to comment, and HP could not be reached for comment. Microsoft will come out with a 64-bit version of Windows tweaked for the chip in the second half of 2004. (Standard 32-bit Windows already runs on Opteron.) Versions of Linux in 64-bit mode already exist. IBM has ported a version of its DB2 database software to run on 64-bit Linux for Opteron. Intel's Itanium chip family runs 64-bit software, but it's entirely different than the Windows/Linux software found on 32-bit machines, a factor that has held back acceptance. In the third quarter, around 10,700 Opteron servers left factories compared with 5,000 Itanium servers, according to IDC. Revenue from the Itanium servers, however, came to $123 million, compared with $61 million for Opteron servers. HP has been a staunch defender of Itanium in the server community and for good reason: It co-designed the architecture behind the chip. "What choice do they have? Very few organizations are buying Itanium systems. AMDs are flying off the shelf," RedMonk analyst James Governor said. "Any server company that does not have an Opteron strategy is not listening to the market." Intel, though, has vowed to increase the available applications for Itanium, as well as work to ensure that the price of Itanium servers steadily drops. Still, Reynolds pointed out that Itanium and Opteron don't directly compete. Itanium is designed to compete with servers containing four or more processors from Sun. These systems typically cost $10,000 to more than $1 million and are used for the most complex computing tasks. Opteron is designed to compete more in the one- to four-processor segment, a market currently dominated by Intel's Xeon chip. Although these servers sell for far less, they account for far more units. "That's where the growth is," Reynolds said. Like Reynolds, Roger Kay, an analyst at IDC, could not confirm or deny the HP-AMD deal. Still, he said it made sense. Opterons are relatively inexpensive and will let HP serve customers that want Opteron servers. The company already uses AMD chips in consumer and business desktops. "HP already broke with the orthodoxy when they put Transmeta chips in their blades," Kay said. In addition, HP sells servers containing its own PA-RISC chips and Alpha processors. CNET News.com's Stephen Shankland and John Spooner contributed to this report.
2001-11-15 - HP tests loyalty with server cancellation  When Hewlett-Packard canceled its venerable 3000 server line Wednesday, it began aggressive programs to keep customers from fleeing the company altogether. But keeping customer loyalty in an environment where some customers feel betrayed will be a challenge for the computing giant. HP announced its intention to phase out the 3000 line over five years in favor of its HP 9000 Unix servers and its NetServer Windows and Linux servers. HP is offering financing deals, discounts, credits and other incentives to keep HP 3000 customers from moving to servers from other companies. "In my agency within the U.S. Department of Defense, we make extensive use of HP 3000 systems," said Tim O'Neill, of the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Test Center. "One certainty for our agency is that if they eliminate the 3000, we will then act to eliminate our 9000s as well. "If HP thinks we will 'migrate' from MPE to HP-UX, they are mistaken," he said, referring to the operating systems associated with the two server lines. The economic slowdown has spurred layoffs and more layoffs at HP. The company is grappling with its proposed merger with Compaq Computer and is focusing on reclaiming momentum in the Unix server market from Sun Microsystems and IBM. A letter sent to HP 3000 customers Wednesday described the company's reasons for canceling the server line, introduced in 1972. Chief among them is that software companies and customers are moving to "open" systems such as Unix, Windows and Linux, whose standards make them a larger market than proprietary systems such as the HP 3000. "We at Hewlett-Packard sincerely thank you for your loyal support of the HP e3000 platform," Winston Prather, general manager of the HP 3000 business, and Jim Murphy, general manager of HP server support, said in the letter. "We are truly committed to continuing to earn your trust and loyalty, and to helping you make a smooth transition to another HP platform." That sentence in particular didn't sit well with some. "The loyalty to the HP e3000 that has been so strong for so long has just been repaid by HP by killing off the HP e3000. Who would you trust in the future, especially in the light of all the promises offered such a short time ago?" asked one member of the HP3000-L mailing list. Gartner analyst Andrew Butler says HP's decision to phase out the 3000 line is a smart one...the time has come to phase it out. see commentary Not everyone is dissatisfied, though. "The problem with something like an HP 3000, it's like using a Betamax videotape: Sure, it might be better quality than VHS, but no one is going to support it," wrote another who said he'd been using HP 3000 for the last 13 years to run software for an airline. "With an HP 3000, you need to find specialist staff, you need to purchase expensive proprietary software, and you have no choice with hardware." And then there are those who make a living helping customers move their software and data to new systems. "Our software has been used to move data off the 3000 platform for a long time," said John Murphy of Taurus Software, which saw a spike in business when fears of the Year 2000 problem spurred many to replace older computer systems. HP's cancellation of the 3000 line will likely result in a bigger, if more protracted, increase in business than the Y2K issue, Murphy said. Some believe HP's decision is reversible, though. "This is not the first time HP has tried this," said Ron Horner, who administers HP 3000 systems that fulfill orders at J.C. Penney. "Sometime in 1985, I think, they were pushing HP-UX pretty hard. But HP changed their minds, mostly because of customer pressure." Many HP 3000 loyalists decry the waning sales effort behind the server. "I don't know if anyone will ever understand HP's self-destructive purge of its sales force in the 1990s. That, and the lack of support from upper management, combined to reduce sales of the 3000," said Stan Sieler of Allegro Consultants, who helped design the system from 1979 to 1983 and whose HP 3000 customers include the telemarketing groups of MicroWarehouse and Tiger Direct. But the 3000's business importance at HP has been dwindling based on sales and support contract renewals, the company said. "Our installed base has been declining for several years, more so in the last two years," the company said in a statement, while declining to discuss profitability. Several 3000 users believe there might yet be a future for the MPE operating system, either on HP 3000 hardware or on different systems. HP has been working to converge the hardware of the 3000 and 9000 line, both of which use the PA-RISC processor, so the hardware underpinnings have a future. But HP is moving its Unix servers to Intel's Itanium chip in the longer run, and the company has ceased its effort to translate the 3000's MPE operating system to Itanium, according to a posting by longtime 3000 employee Jeff Vance. Releasing MPE as an open-source effort--the collaborative programming method that underlies Linux--might also preserve the operating system. Sieler believes releasing MPE as open source is the "right thing." Added Horner, "I don't think we can get a reversal," convincing HP to overturn its cancellation decision, "but if we could take it over, that's a different story." HP is examining what exactly to do with the operating system and is open to several possibilities, said Dave Wilde, research and development manager for the 3000 line. The issue with open source, though, is finding a way to ensure existing HP customers' needs are met, something that open-source software doesn't guarantee. "Maintaining an operating system in a way that meets customer-support needs for mission-critical operating systems is no small feat," he said. "It's clearly something HP has invested a lot in. We want to make sure that whatever solutions we develop will be good for our customer. It's not clear that open source is good for that. We're open to that discussion."
2004-10-05 - HP tells Sun to get its facts straight Hewlett-Packard has formally demanded that Sun Microsystems and its president, Jonathan Schwartz, stop publishing what it calls "misleading and factually incorrect statements" about HP's commitment to its version of Unix--but Sun is standing firm. On Sept. 28, HP sent Sun a letter criticizing Sun publications that say the HP-UX operating system is doomed, due mostly to the chips that HP is pairing with the operating system. HP said its strategy is sound and Sun's assertions are completely unfounded. "We want our customers to know we're committed to HP-UX for the long term," Don Jenkins, vice president of marketing for HP's Business Critical Systems group, said in an interview. "If (Sun) checked the facts, they wouldn't be able to support the statements they are making." HP wants debate to be "aggressive and competitive," Jenkins said, but intentionally misleading customers or (the media) is not a practice we consider appropriate." Larry Singer, Sun's chief marketing officer, said HP's letter took issue with a Schwartz Web log posting, an opinion by Singer on Sun's Web site and an online ad. But asked whether Sun would change the materials, Singer said Monday, "it ain't happening." Sun's assertions about the longevity of HP-UX derive from a conclusion based on market realities, and Sun stands by it, Singer said. "We absolutely think HP-UX is dead," despite HP's recruitment and support plans. Public displays of disaffection The debate highlights the spats that can ensue when companies take their gripes directly to the public. Sun didn't respond graciously after IBM distributed an open letter asking it to unfetter the source code of its Java software. And Schwartz's attacks on Red Hat have prompted a critical response from the Linux seller on the issues of software patents and open-source software. At the same time, marketing agreements can override such rivalries. Sun, which has lambasted Microsoft for years, has made room on its Web site for an "exclusive" interview with Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer. Taking the offensive in the current spat, Sun's Singer said HP isn't afraid to discuss its conclusions about Sun. When HP CEO Carly Fiorina meets with potential customers, Singer said, she brandishes slides that show Sun's stock price slide and tells customers that "Sun is just irrelevant and everyone knows it's about to go out of business," Singer said. But HP is sticking to the facts in that kind of an attack, Jenkins said. "Sun's stock price performance is a matter of public record. I'm sorry if (Singer) doesn't like it if we point that out to customers," he said. Sun's attack, however, has "overstepped the bounds of normal business practices," Jenkins said. "We think Sun has maybe become desperate in the way they've gone about saving Solaris." Chips on their shoulders Sun is launching its marketing attack because it sees HP-UX customers as easy prey for its sales force. Sun argues that HP is abandoning those customers by canceling its own PA-RISC chip line that is the most widely used foundation for HP-UX and by failing to bring HP-UX to x86 chips--an undeniable force in the server market. HP is encouraging its HP-UX customers to move from PA-RISC servers to those using Intel's Itanium over a period of years. At the same time, HP is bolstering the operating system with high-end features from Compaq's Tru64 Unix, which also is being phased out. The changes mean that customers must switch to new hardware over a period of several years. As long as a switch is inevitable, Sun is trying to encourage a switch to its own products through a program called HP Away. Part of the campaign touts the fact that Sun is bringing its Solaris version of Unix to servers based on the widely used x86 chips such as Xeon and Opteron. HP-UX, by contrast, runs only on PA-RISC and Itanium servers. "We don't right now have any strategy to put HP-UX on x86," Jenkins said. Stay tuned The letter, initially made public through a Friday article by "Computerworld Today," was just one of a handful sent through a private "back channel" that Sun and HP use to discreetly point out factual slip-ups, Singer said. But more publicity is all but inevitable. Sun plans to rebut the letter publicly in coming days, Singer said. And Schwartz is likely expand the attack because of HP's letter. "This kind of thing stimulates Jonathan," Singer said. "There might be changes to the blog, but my guess they'll by more assertive."
2005-04-21 - HP Sun bring dual-core Opterons to servers Hewlett-Packard has upgraded a four-processor server with Advanced Micro Devices' new dual-core Opteron and introduced a blade server with the chip. The ProLiant DL585 system will be available with all three speed grades of the new Opteron--1.8Gz, 2.0GHz and 2.2GHz--said Steve Cumings, manager of HP's ProLiant Opteron systems group. And in an effort to encourage fast adoption, HP is charging the same for a system with 1.8GHz dual-core processors as it would for the existing products with 2.6GHz single-core chips. "We expect to gain a lot of market share with this kind of pricing. It's a way to capture market share while we can," Cumings said. The new BL45p blade system, announced Thursday, is HP's first four-Opteron blade and it brings a substantial change: It's half the size of the existing Xeon model. Four machines can fit into a 10.5-inch-tall chassis compared with two Xeon-based BL40p models. But IBM is still ahead: Its 12.25-inch tall BladeCenter can house seven four-Xeon blades. Big Blue is expected to announce its first Opteron blades alongside AMD's launch of the dual-core chips on Thursday. Sun Microsystems, meanwhile, introduced The Sun Fire V40z server, which contains four dual-core processors and hence functions like a typical eight-processor server. Sun says the machine is designed to run on 42 percent of the power it would require to animate an equivalent server with eight Xeon processors. The server will start shipping in May. A version of the V40z with the four Opteron 875 chips and 16GB of memory will sell for about $39,000. Dual-core chips combine two processing engines, or cores, onto a single slice of silicon in an attempt to increase performance without causing heating problems. They're best suited to server software, which more often is written to take advantage of the ability to handle multiple simultaneous tasks. IBM, Sun Microsystems and HP already offer dual-core chips for their Unix servers, but the technology is just arriving in mainstream x86 chips. The first dual-core Opterons are series 800 models geared to four-processor systems. HP servers with the chips are due to ship in late May, Cumings said, but by the end of June, HP will release servers with the dual-core series 200 chips for dual-processor systems. "We are going to refresh our entire line with dual-core," Cumings said. "We'll have it in dual-processor blades, the DL385 and the DL145." Dual-core gives a significant performance boost, Cuming said. For example, a four-processor model with 2.2GHz dual-core chips scores 75 percent faster on a speed test using SAP's business software than a system with four 2.6GHz single-core processors. In addition, he said, "Dual-core Opteron has a huge performance advantage over Xeon," at least until Intel catches up with its own dual-core models. HP won't release dual-core pricing details until the systems ship, but if HP holds to its promise that 1.8GHz dual-core systems will cost the same as those with 2.6GHz single-core chips, some guesses can be made. A DL585 with four 2.6GHz single-core processors, 8GB of memory and a 36GB 15K SCSI drive costs $24,755. And HP said a BL45p with two 2.6GHz single-core processors, 4GB of memory and two 36GB 15K SCSI drives costs $11,895. The latest change The arrival of dual-core Opterons is only the latest upheaval the processor line has triggered in the server realm. The first affected was Intel, which for years had the x86 server market to itself. But with much of its energy focused on a rival chip family called Itanium, Intel lagged AMD. Its first x86 chips with 64-bit features--which permit easy use of more than 4GB of memory--arrived more than a year later than Opteron, and it doesn't expect to introduce dual-core Xeons until early 2006. It still hasn't said when it will release a chip with built-in memory controller, a feature that many say is fundamental to Opteron's performance. Server makers adjusted, too. IBM was the first, adopting the processor but only promoting it for use in systems for the high-performance technical computing niche. Next came Sun, which had shunned x86 processors for years, then used Opteron to spearhead its entry into the market. It even went as far as acquiring start-up Kealia--and its key employee, Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim--for new Opteron systems code-named Galaxy. Then another significant ally: HP, which had co-developed a rival Intel 64-bit processor, Itanium, which was largely incompatible with software written for x86 chips such as Xeon or Opteron. The only holdout among the top four server makers is Dell, which has come close to an AMD partnership but which remains the staunchest Intel ally.
2004-02-24 - HP set to unveil Opteron server    Hewlett-Packard is expected Tuesday to announce a server based on Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron processor, the latest move in a chess game between AMD and Intel over 64-bit chips. The move, first reported by CNET News.com, would make HP the third of the four major server makers to incorporate the AMD chip. Sources expect HP's Opteron servers to have between one and four processors. HP declined to comment but said in a press statement that Scott Stallard, senior vice president and general manager of HP's Enterprise Storage and Servers group, "will announce the expansion of its industry standard solutions portfolio" on Tuesday. Opteron adds 64-bit extensions to the widely used 32-bit "x86" family of processors, such as Intel's Pentium or Xeon. This means that it can break through the 4GB memory barrier of 32-bit chips. Intel announced last week that it will match those 64-bit extensions with a compatible technology called CT, scheduled to arrive by mid-2004 in a new Xeon processor code-named Nocona. Before Intel made its move, a company that wanted to use software reworked to take advantage of Opteron's 64-bit extensions would have had to bet that AMD would keep on delivering competitive server chips. Intel's extensions, however, mean that software will work on either company's processors and therefore that Opteron is a more routine option. HP's adoption of Opteron and 64-bit x86 chips might not be as dramatic as it would have been before Intel announced its move, but it is still notable. For more than a decade, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company and Intel have invested very heavily in a higher-end 64-bit chip family, called Itanium, that runs x86 software comparatively slowly through an emulation process. Itanium was once expected to become as pervasive in the server market as Pentium is for desktop computers. That possibility has faded with product delays, the 2001 end of server market exuberance, Xeon's continued gains, Opteron's arrival and stronger competition from IBM and Sun's own processors. IBM released an Opteron server in 2003 for the cluster-supercomputing niche. Sun Microsystems has a more aggressive plan, which includes the release of dual-Opteron machines in April, the launch of four- and eight-processor successors and the planned acquisition of Opteron specialist Kealia.
2005-05-25 - HP set to debut last in-house chip Hewlett-Packard is set to debut as soon as next week its first Unix servers with the last member of the company's PA-RISC processor family, a lineage that's being supplanted by Intel's Itanium. The company is likely to announce June 1 that the PA-8900 processor has arrived in the HP 9000 line of Unix servers, sources familiar with the plan said. The chip is expected to run at speeds of 800MHz, 1GHz and 1.1GHz, according to one source. HP declined to comment for this story. But one HP Web page about its top-end Superdome server said the PA-8900 will be launched May 30. The PA-8900--like the Alpha EV7z introduced last year--is the final member of an HP chip family the company is phasing out as part of a plan to simplify its high-end server products with Itanium. HP also is expected to begin bringing its NonStop line to Itanium next week. A simpler product line and the resulting expense reductions are important to HP's efforts to dramatically cut expenses. Itanium is a solid processor, but it's not clear whether it will achieve the industry-standard status Intel would like for it. Fujitsu, NEC, Unisys and Silicon Graphics design their own Itanium servers, but HP's top-tier server rivals prefer machines with their own processors--Sun Microsystems with UltraSparc and IBM with Power. "The questions around Itanium are not whether it's a fast chip--it is--and whether HP will be able to migrate its customers to it--for the most part, they will--but whether this is ever going to become a widespread chip outside of HP," said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. And because moving from PA-RISC to Itanium requires new software as well as hardware, IBM and Sun have been trying to lure away HP Unix customers that already are facing a significant transition. The PA-RISC-based HP 9000 line can run the HP-UX version of Unix, but the Itanium-based Integrity line can run Windows and Linux operating systems as well. The PA-8900 is expected to be used across the full line of HP 9000 servers. The rp3410-2, with dual processors, is expected to come with 800MHz PA-8900 processors. The rp3440-4 and rp4440-8, with four and eight processors respectively, will be available with 800MHz or 1GHz PA-8900s, according to a source familiar with HP's plans. Higher up the pecking order, the rp7420-16 and 8420-32 will be available with 1GHz or 1.1GHz PA-8900 processors. The Superdome will be available with the 1.1GHz chips. One difference between the processors is the amount of high-speed cache memory included. PA-8900 processor modules use 64MB, double that of the PA-8800 generation.
2001-09-13 - HP server chip group transferred to Intel  The engineers responsible for developing server chipsets at Hewlett-Packard have been transferred to Intel under a technological alliance that could further accelerate the adoption of Intel's Itanium processor. Under the tech industry's equivalent of a player trade in the sports world, close to 100 HP engineers have moved over to Intel to develop chipsets for future Intel-based servers, according to sources. The group will likely work on technology for Itanium, the 64-bit server chip co-developed by HP and Intel. Itanium servers are designed to compete against large Unix/RISC servers from Sun Microsystems. In that market, Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP primarily markets servers based on its PA-RISC chips, but the company plans to migrate to the Itanium family over the next few years. At HP, the group worked on chipsets that could be used with PA-RISC or Itanium processors. An Intel representative declined to provide the number of engineers sent to Intel in the deal but confirmed the outlines of the deal and stated that virtually all of them have already accepted positions at the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip giant. "We've entered into an agreement with them to accelerate the development of Intel server chipsets," the representative said. By acquiring HP's engineering talent, Intel will expand its server intellectual capital. For years, Intel has dominated the research and development surrounding PCs. Servers, however, are much more complicated beasts and require companies to have expertise in multiprocessing, intricate input-output subsystems and other technology. Intel has engaged in server development, but most of its work has been concentrated on boxes with eight or fewer processors. Some future Itanium systems will contain hundreds of processors. Although they don't enjoy as glamorous a reputation as processors, chipsets play an equally important part in servers. Chipsets effectively control the flow of data and prevent data corruption. More engineers may migrate from HP to Intel in the future, predicted Linley Group analyst Linley Gwennap. HP still employs about 200 engineers who work on "McKinley," the next version of Itanium due out in test systems later this year, and McKinley's successors. HP and Intel designed Itanium together, but Intel will manufacture the chip. These engineers will likely transfer, although HP will probably keep its PA-RISC team in-house. "If you are Intel and you invested a lot of money in Itanium, does it make sent to have part of it in control of another company?" Gwennap said. "A year ago, HP planned on differentiating on Itanium by doing a lot of their own design. Now they are looking at diffentiating on software and differentiating on services." In June, Intel entered into a broader, but conceptually similar, agreement with Compaq. Under that deal, Intel acquired a license for Compaq's Alpha chip, compiler technology in Compaq's possession and most of the Alpha engineering team. HP made a bid to acquire Compaq earlier this month. Intel acquired approximately 200 Alpha engineers in that deal and will likely acquire more over the next 28 months, the Intel spokesman said. In these sorts of deals, the personnel and engineering know-how is often far more important than patents or product plans. In one of the biggest personnel coups of the past few years, Advanced Micro Devices was able to recruit Dirk Meyer away from the Alpha design team. Meyer went on to manage the development of the Athlon chip for AMD. For its part, HP will be able to reduce its independent research budget. Part of Itanium's appeal lies in the fact that servers built around the chip are expected to cost less than servers where all the crucial internal technology comes from one or two companies. Instead of spending time and money developing processors or multiprocessing chipsets, companies like IBM and HP will just have to buy these parts from Intel. "This is a way to cut your R&D budget," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. "You are already reducing your processor R&D budget." In a research note, analyst Ashok Kumar of US Bancorp Piper Jaffray stated that HP "recently terminated an internal Itanium chipset, transferring the design and the design team to Intel, because it couldn't afford the effort." The alliance could also likely lead to Intel fabricating some chips on behalf of HP. HP's Unix servers, beginning with the N-class system introduced in 1999 and including the top-end Superdome, have been designed to accommodate either Itanium or PA-RISC chips. Although HP is migrating over to Itanium, the complete conversion is still a few years off. Intel therefore is the logical party to make chipsets for Superdome and other HP Unix servers. Chipsets that can work with two types of processors are becoming more common, noted Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64. IBM's Summit chipset, for instance, can connect to both Xeon processors and an upcoming version of Itanium code-named McKinley.
2003-05-19 - HP revs up Itanium offerings   Hewlett-Packard launched a new version of its operating system for Intel's Itanium 2 processor, and announced new customers and software partners, as HP gears up for the next rev of Itanium this summer. On Monday, Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP released HP-UX 11iv2, the latest version of its Unix operating system, for Itanium 2 servers and workstations. The OS can run on servers containing up to 64 processors, and, later, servers with 128 processors. HP has already said it will come out with a version of its Superdome server, originally equipped with HP's PA-RISC chip, which is capable of holding 64, and later 128, Intel Itanium 2 chips. Twenty-five software developers--including I2 Technologies, Check Point Software and Borland--said they would port their applications to the new OS and the chip. Although Oracle, Tibco and others have already committed to writing applications to run on HP-UP for Itanium, the software options have been comparatively limited. Additionally, HP said the Chrysler Group, a division of DaimlerChrysler, has installed a workstation cluster based around 200 Itanium 2 chips for testing and simulating auto components. The Itanium-based workstation cluster is 50 percent faster than on the former machines that Chrysler used for the job, according to the companies. Both HP and Intel are hoping that the third time's a charm for Itanium. Madison, the third version of the chip family, is coming this summer. The chip is similar to the Itanium 2, formerly code-named McKinley, and will fit into the same computers. It will also be sold under the Itanium 2 name. "The moon and stars are beginning to line up," said Mike Wordley, worldwide HP-UX marketing manager, who added that the chip improves security, because SSL encryption is built into it. To date, Itanium and Itanium 2 sales have been anemic. The first version of the chip, which debuted in 2001 after several delays, offered performance well below expectations. The Itanium 2 substantially improved many of the performance issues, but came out in July 2002, a time when corporate customers and software developers had little interest in investing in new servers. Consequently, hardware makers dragged their feet--IBM only came out with its first major Itanium 2 server at the end of last month. Dell Computer passed on the first Itanium 2. Earlier this month, Intel admitted that there was a bug with some Itanium 2 systems, which it has offered to fix. Performancewise, Madison will outstrip its predecessors. The chip, due in July, will be made on the more advanced 130-nanometer manufacturing process, rather than the older 180- Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. nanometer process used on the McKinley version. As a result, Madison will have up to 6MB of level-three cache, twice that of the current Itanium 2, and run at 1.5GHz, faster than the 1GHz Itanium 2 currently on the market. Overall, HP and Intel say Madison will provide a 50 percent performance improvement over the existing Itanium 2. Early independent benchmark tests published by the Transaction Processing Performance Council already indicate that HP Madison servers rank up in the same league as the top systems in different categories from IBM or NEC. These benchmark results may in turn begin to drive sales. Dell has said it will come out with Madison Itanium 2 servers.
2004-05-18 - HP reports profit growth raises sales forecast Hewlett-Packard's net income increased 34 percent to $884 million for its most recent quarter, boosted by strength in servers, printers and services. For its fiscal second quarter, which ended April 30, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based computing giant had revenue of $20.1 billion--a company record. That's a 12 percent increase over the year-ago quarter and better than the average of $19.3 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. Using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, HP reported earnings of 29 cents per share. Excluding several one-time items, the company had net income of 34 cents per share, matching First Call average estimates. "Our business continues to fire on all cylinders," Chief Executive Carly Fiorina said during a conference call. "We're gaining ground, despite competitive rhetoric." The company also increased its estimated revenue for the remaining half of the fiscal year from $39.7 billion to $40.7 billion. HP's results include a $105 million settlement of a billing dispute with the government of Canada--money the company hopes to recover through legal actions against those HP believes responsible. Because some already has been paid, the settlement will result in a $70 million charge, HP said. The biggest fraction of operating profits continues to come from HP's imaging and printing business, which grew $28 million to $953 million. Revenue increased 11 percent to $6.1 billion for sales of products such as printers and digital cameras, but growth was strong in particular for supplies such as toner for laser printers and ink for inkjets. "I think what we are seeing is the cumulative impact of investing in categories where supplies are used even more strongly," Fiorina said. "It's clear color printers use more supplies than monochrome printers, and color is now going mainstream" among business buyers, she said. HP's server and storage group reported a $62 million increase in operating profit to $120 million on revenue of $4 billion. Within the group, the ProLiant server line, based on Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron, was strong, with revenue growth of 15 percent, HP said. ProLiant servers were subject to fierce price pressure, though, and average selling prices decreased, HP said. HP's top server competitor, IBM, is resurgent after struggling in the 1990s and still has a commanding lead. In the first quarter of 2004, Big Blue said its server revenue grew 19 percent. In HP's high-end server line, the company is slowly moving customers from its own PA-RISC and Alpha processors to Intel's Itanium. The Itanium-based Integrity line accounted for 16 percent of revenues and 26 percent of unit shipments for high-end servers, Fiorina said. Services operating margin increasing $32 million to $329 million on revenue of $3.5 billion. Much of the boost came from managed services--through which HP runs clients' computing infrastructure--where revenue increased 50 percent to about $650 million, spokesman Brian Humphries said. HP's software group, however, remained unprofitable. Expenses came from the company's research costs and acquisitions of software companies such as TruLogica, Novadigm and Consera Software. That unprofitability should ease, however. "We have plans in place to see substantial profit improvement next year," Chief Financial Officer Bob Wayman said of the software group. The software companies put some flesh on the bones of HP's Adaptive Enterprise strategy, a variation of the utility computing trend sweeping high-technology companies. With the effort, HP hopes to lure customers with the promise of a computing infrastructure that's flexible and boasts operating costs matched to a company's business. On May 1, HP unified services, software, and storage and servers into its new Technology Solutions Group under Ann Livermore's leadership. Collectively, that group had operating profits of $400 million on revenue of $7.7 billion. Personal computer operating profits grew $22 million to $45 million on revenue that grew 17 percent to $6 billion, HP said. Average selling prices there increased for both laptops and desktops, a favorable circumstance not experienced by rival Dell, Fiorina said. HP has begun embracing the Linux operating system for desktop computers, but the effort is very young, Fiorina said. "We do see growing interest, in particular in the developing markets of the world. We have not yet seen real interest in the developed markets," Fiorina said. "I would call it interest, as opposed to demand we're willing to count on. We do have a number of pilot projects."
2002-09-16 - HP Red Hat team on Linux workstation   Hewlett-Packard has begun selling new workstations using Intel's Itanium 2 processor and a new higher-end version of Red Hat Linux, company executives said Monday. Red Hat had planned to release its Advanced Workstation product in the first half of 2003, but accelerated the schedule as part of an expanded alliance, said Mike Evans, vice president of business development at Red Hat. The alliance shows what companies can--and often will--do to push mainstream acceptance for new technologies. Linux, a clone of the venerable Unix operating system, has emerged in recent years as a viable contender to Windows and Unix in some markets but still isn't as well established. The Itanium line, meanwhile, is a completely different design from other Intel processors and software companies are just beginning to support it. Additionally, HP is lopping about 20 percent off the price of two workstation models in a promotion running through Oct. 18 in the United States. A zx2000 with a single 900MHz Itanium 2 costs $3,991 instead of the previous $4,989; a two-processor zx6000 costs $7,851 instead of $10,595. HP also sells a version of the workstation with HP-UX, its version of Unix, but a Windows version awaits the final release of Microsoft's operating system scheduled in the first quarter of 2003, said Larry Mahoney, worldwide product manager for Itanium workstations. "For Windows, we're waiting on Microsoft," Mahoney said. Advanced Workstation is similar in concept to the Advanced Server version Red Hat began selling earlier this year; it changes less frequently, so software companies have an easier time supporting it, and is designed with higher-end features. Red Hat is planning a bigger push into selling Linux for desktop computers. Evans said the company expects to unveil plans for the desktop software soon. "We're looking at...a bunch of different markets--the traditional desktop office systems (and those for) basic things like Internet access, software development and engineering, and retail stores," Mahoney said. "When we have more roadmap detail, you'll see which (segment) we believe we're ready to participate in and which will take longer. We believe there is a capability for Linux in all those market segments." The company also plans an Advanced Workstation version for the more common Pentium processors and those compatible with it. On the HP workstations, the HP-UX and Linux systems will cost about the same after the promotion expires, said Pat Duba, HP's North American product manager for Itanium 2 workstations. The hardware costs are the same, while the cost of the operating system component is $245 for HP-UX, $250 for Advanced Workstation on the single-processor system and $350 for Advanced Workstation on the dual-processor system, Duba said. However, HP is having trouble meeting demand because of a surge of government buying before the end of the federal fiscal year. Current zx2000 and zx6000 products are backordered. Computers with 900MHz Itanium 2 processors take about two weeks to deliver, and those with 1GHz take about four weeks, Duba said. Much of the interest in the workstations is coming from technical users such as Pacific Northwest National Laboratory who are bringing the systems together into what amounts to a supercomputer, Duba said. These users then plan to later recycle the technology into desktop systems for engineers, he said. One major advantage of Itanium over previous Intel chips is support for more than 4GB of memory--the practical limit for Intel's Xeon and Pentium processors. Though HP declined to offer specific numbers about product shipments, Mahoney said in the long term, HP expects more Linux and Windows zx2000 systems to ship than HP-UX. For the higher-end zx6000, he said he expects Linux to be the most popular because many customers are buying the system for use as a node in a supercomputer. "It's a great compute node, and the high-end computer cluster activity right now is in Linux," Mahoney said.
2011-11-23 - HP recruiting EU in its Itanium fight against Oracle   Hewlett-Packard is calling in reinforcements from Europe to help it in its latest battle against Oracle. The PC maker has asked European Union antitrust officials to investigate whether Oracle acted improperly by ending support for Intel's Itanium microprocessor, according to Reuters. In June, HP launched a lawsuit against Oracle, alleging that the database giant's decision to stop making software for Itanium was simply an attempt to drive business away from HP and toward Oracle. Oracle had announced in March that it would no longer develop software for the chip. But HP has been heavily invested in using Itanium in business servers and other high-performance systems for its enterprise customers. HP and Intel are also both bound by contract to continue selling Itanium processors and servers over the next several years, according to HP, which has labeled Oracle's action a "calculated effort to thwart competition from HP and harm its customers." Further, HP said in August that Oracle's action has already hurt sales of its mission-critical systems. In its defense, Oracle claims that it ended support for Itanium based on plans by both HP and Intel to stop working on the chip, which has been portrayed as a dying technology. However, HP and Intel have denied such plans. In response, Oracle believes HP and Intel cooked up a secret agreement to keep the chip on the market. "HP has secretly contracted with Intel to keep churning out Itaniums so that HP can maintain the appearance that a dead microprocessor is still alive," Oracle said in a court filing. Related stories Hewlett-Packard sues Oracle over Itanium support Oracle's choice to nix Itanium support hurts HP sales Oracle: Reports of Itanium's life greatly exaggerated The decision to enlist the aid of the EU was revealed yesterday in a court hearing in San Jose, Calif., by lawyers for both HP and Oracle. "They are going literally around the world to every antitrust jurisdiction, trying to say we're trying to put them out of business," Oracle attorney Daniel Wall said, according to Reuters. Many U.S. tech giants have often bumped into trouble with the EU over antitrust concerns. So it's an ironic but calculated move that HP would try to enlist European aid in its latest legal battle. Despite attempts by Santa Clara Superior Court Judge James Kleinberg to get the two combatants to settle the case, attorneys for both sides seem intent on taking it to court. A trial date has been set for April 2, 2012. An HP representative released a statement to CNET, saying that HP "is pursuing all avenues to enforce Oracle's commitments to HP and our shared customers, and will continue to take actions to protect its customers' best interests. It is our hope that Oracle will honor its commitments to HP and to our shared customers." A spokesman for Intel told CNET that "the company is not party to this litigation, so we therefore will not comment on it." But he added that "we've previously said that we have multiple generations of Itanium microprocessors currently under development." An Oracle representative declined to comment.

2003-05-22 - HP puts Windows server back on top After further optimization, Hewlett-Packard has reclaimed its top rank from IBM on a server speed test using a machine with 64 Itanium 2 6M processors and Microsoft Windows. HP's Superdome server achieved 707,000 transactions per minute on the single-system version of the Transaction Processing Performance Council's TPC-C test, the company said Wednesday. The result nudged the Superdome past an IBM p690 Turbo Unix server that had stolen the lead two weeks ago with a score of 681,000. IBM, which has new Unix servers planned for 2004, expects it will be able to reclaim the crown, a representative said. The TPC-C test, which simulates a heavy load of transactions such as purchase orders and inventory changes in a warehouse, isn't a flawless measure of real-world performance, but it's still widely watched. HP considers it a necessary indication that its new systems are worth buying. "When you're launching a brand-new architecture, you've got to put a stake in the ground," said Peter Blackmore, head of HP's Enterprise Server Group, in an interview. HP's plans include Superdomes using both its own PA-RISC processor and Intel's Itanium--which HP initiated and helped to develop. The Itanium models, though, will outperform the PA-RISC models, Blackmore said. "We know it already outperforms PA-RISC," Blackmore said of Itanium. However, he said he couldn't predict when Itanium systems, which require new software for top performance, would outsell PA-RISC systems. HP's Itanium systems run Windows, Linux, OpenVMS and the HP-UX version of Unix. The first Superdome with Itanium family processors is expected in late summer, according to Mark Hudson, head of HP's high-end server marketing. A Superdome with 128 Itanium 2 6M processors is expected in January. The Itanium systems, in combination with Microsoft's new Windows Server 2003, have given Microsoft new potential in the market for powerful servers with dozens of processors.
2003-11-11 - HP pushes IT management strategy   As part of its "adaptive enterprise" push, Hewlett-Packard on Tuesday announced new services and software for managing information technology operations. As expected, HP announced software for managing the Unix, Linux and Windows operating systems from a single console. HP also introduced a management platform for Web services, announced a partnership with business software company SAP and said it plans to acquire Persist Technologies, a software company focused on managing information from creation to deletion. HP said it has new certification programs related to what it defines as "best practices" in running IT departments more like a business. Certifications are available for internal IT divisions as well as IT services companies. The company also announced that it would offer documentation for effective work processes related to its OpenView service desk software, which is focused on help-desk tasks. The documentation can be purchased together with the software or separately. Get Up to Speed on... Utility computing Get the latest headlines andcompany-specific news in ourexpanded GUTS section. The new offerings allow for the "adaptive management" of IT, HP said. "Adaptive management breaks the cycle of endless maintenance costs, so CIOs (chief information officers) can once again invest in innovation," Nora Denzel, senior vice president of HP's Adaptive Enterprise, said in a statement. "Management services like ITSM (IT Service Management) can help our customers create a lean, responsive IT operation, while management software provides the key to linking business processes and applications down into the raw hardware." HP's efforts in "adaptive enterprise" are similar to those of other companies trying to lower the costs of IT operations and transform computing eventually into a utilitylike service. IBM and Sun have efforts along these lines. Dell made its own offerings on Tuesday, when it unveiled three server management tools that let information technology managers control their hardware and Microsoft software at the same time. Denzel said the management products announced Tuesday from Dell and HP were quite different. She said HP technology can manage heterogeneous computing environments, while Dell's announcement is focused on Microsoft software. "We're talking about a distributor (Dell) going back to their (research and development) partner (Microsoft) for more R&D," Denzel said. HP's newly unveiled software for managing multiple operating systems from a single console is called HP Systems Insight Manager. HP said the product unifies the management of HP ProLiant, Integrity and HP 9000 servers. Managing multiple operating systems is important for HP, because its Itanium servers--its Integrity line--can simultaneously run Windows, Linux and HP-UX. That means that the company doesn't have to design as many different types of computers. Eliminating the management headaches of dealing with different operating systems gets HP closer to "something that actually benefits customers as opposed to HP's development costs," Gordon Haff, an analyst at Illuminata, said last week. HP's new Web services product is called OpenView Management Integration Platform. It is based in part on the company's acquisition of Talking Blocks technology. Get Up to Speed on... Web services Get the latest headlines andcompany-specific news in ourexpanded GUTS section. "It eases the way you link a business process to your IT gear," Denzel said. To demonstrate how the technology can help a business, Denzel gave the example of a company's employees signing up for benefits through a Web portal. At a typical company, if the registration system is running slowly, IT managers might only hear about it if users complain, and they may have a hard time measuring exactly how many users are able to sign up each hour, she said. But with the new software, managers could get a description of the problem that details the number of users registering per hour, Denzel said. The software also would suggest how to improve the performance of the system--say by adding storage, she added. HP and SAP said they will work together to help large organizations efficiently manage IT environments that use technology from different companies. HP and SAP have already had an alliance for 15 years. HP would not disclose the terms of its planned acquisition of Persist Technologies, which is about two years old and based in Pleasanton, Calif. Persist makes a storage device designed to allow speedy retrievals of data. Bob Schultz, general manager of HP's network storage solutions unit, said HP has been reselling Persist's technology for several months. He said HP decided to buy the company partly to allay customer concerns that Persist would not persist as a viable business.
2006-12-01 - HP promises Unix improvements  Hewlett-Packard is preparing to release security and virtualization improvements to its Unix operating system and says it's now fulfilling a long-promised Itanium performance advantage. Most of the improvements will arrive in HP-UX 11i version 3, due to begin shipping this year but not formally launched until about three months from now, said Nick van der Zweep, director of virtualization and Integrity server software. However, one security feature--the ability to automatically encrypt files as they're stored--already has been added to version 2. HP-UX, along with Sun Microsystems' Solaris and IBM's AIX, is one of the three major server versions of Unix to survive the consolidation that has claimed HP's Tru64 Unix, Silicon Graphics' Irix, Sequent's Dynix/ptx and Data General's DG/UX. HP-UX runs on HP servers using its own PA-RISC chip, but the company is trying to move those customers to the newer Integrity line of machines using Intel's Itanium processor. AIX runs on IBM's Power-based systems, while Solaris runs on its and Fujitsu's Sparc-based machines and on a wide number of servers using servers using x86 processors such as Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron. Sun and IBM both enjoy taking potshots at Itanium, which has caught on more slowly and less widely than HP and Itanium initially envisioned. But because of changes in software development tool called a compiler, HP expects Itanium systems running HP-UX 11i version 3 to become more competitive. Compilers translate human-written programs into instructions the computer can understand, and an early promise of Itanium systems was that sophisticated compilers would prepare software for fast execution on the chip. That promise proved harder to attain than initially expected, but HP says its work now will pay off. Server software in general runs 25 to 35 percent faster on version 3 because of the new compiler, and Java programs show even more, van der Zweep said. "We promised a lot a long time ago. We've been quietly doing it," he said of the compiler work. HP delayed version 3 earlier so it could incorporate some features that customers wanted soon, such as a cluster file system, into an updated version 2. Virtualization and security Virtualization is a hot subject today as customers employ the technology to run multiple operating systems on a single server, increasing efficiency by dividing a machine into partitions. One HP-UX virtualization improvement coming in version 3--though not necessarily at launch--will be greater flexibility in assigning computing resources to those partitions, van der Zweep said. Specifically, today an administrator can assign a specific percentage of processing power to a partition. With version 3, the administrator will be able to assign memory and input-output resources such as network capacity as well, van der Zweep said. Another security improvement, to be formally announced later in December, will be an improved management interface for security settings and for locking a computer down by shutting down unwanted services, he said. "Every service you don't need is a potential for somebody to come in through a back door," van der Zweep said. Version 3 will unify the interface of the Bastille lock-down technology with the regular system administration interface. It also includes new abilities to monitor a server over the long term to make sure unwanted services aren't switched on, he added. HP also is working on version 4, which will include "policy-based services provisioning" and "zero-downtime virtualization," and version 5, about which van der Zweep shared no details. New versions are scheduled to arrive every two to three years. The company is preserving the higher-level 11i version number to indicate binary compatibility--in other words, the guarantee that software that works on one version of 11i will work on the next without requiring modification.
2006-03-03 - HP prepares 'infinity' campaign for Itanium servers    PALO ALTO, Calif.--Hewlett-Packard plans to launch a major new ad campaign in coming days using the infinity symbol to try to show the potential of its Itanium-based Integrity server line. The symbol--a figure eight turned on its side made out of speckles--was featured prominently next to Chief Executive Mark Hurd, who touted his company's commitment to the Integrity line in a meeting with customers at HP headquarters here Thursday. The campaign will launch in coming days, spokesman Don Gentile said Thursday. It's part of the massive financial commitment HP has made to products using the beleaguered high-end Intel Itanium processor. Intel and HP are leading an effort to regain momentum for the chip that stalled because of product delays, software incompatibility and poor initial performance. "HP is committed to invest $1 billion per year over the next five years to Integrity," Hurd said at the event, meaning that HP accounts for half the $10 billion that a multicompany alliance plans to spend on Itanium through 2010. "That's $1 billion in research and development, software, hardware and services." Members of the Itanium Solutions Alliance include HP, Intel, Unisys, Silicon Graphics, Oracle, Red Hat, Microsoft and Fujitsu. The campaign comes shortly before HP upgrades the Superdome products at the top end of its Integrity line. Later in March, HP will launch its third-generation Superdome models based on a chipset code-named Arches. "In a few weeks we'll introduce a new Integrity chipset with up to 30 percent higher capacity. It adds new availability features to significantly reduce planned and unplanned downtime," Hurd said. The system was slated to ship with Intel's forthcoming "Montecito" version of Itanium, but the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker delayed that processor's debut from 2005 to mid-2006. HP believes the 30 percent performance boost even with the existing "Madison" version of Itanium will be compelling, and it plans incentives to encourage customers to upgrade to Montecito when it arrives. Intel believes the new systems will mark a turning point in the troubled history of Itanium. "The Integrity machine based on Montecito is really the machine we've been waiting for, the machine our collective sales forces can get behind," Chief Executive Paul Otellini said at the event. "I think you'll see customer adoption rates much faster than you'd expect." Otellini affirmed Intel's Itanium commitment at the event. "We have a clear roadmap to 2010 and beyond with four generations of Itanium in development inside Intel," he said, referring to Montecito, Montvale, Tukwila and Poulson. "We have hundreds of Intel engineers working on (software development) tools and compilers. The hundreds working on compilers pales to the thousands of engineers doing silicon development." The other three of the top four server makers--Dell, IBM and Sun Microsystems--disagree with Intel and HP. IBM and Dell canceled their Itanium-based products, and Sun Chief Executive Scott McNealy said in February of the $10 billion Itanium development initiative, "I hope that gang of companies continues to pour money down the Itanium sinkhole. That's opportunity cost that can't be measured." For the high-end server market at which Itanium is aimed, manufacturers sell $28 billion in products annually. Most of that is spent on mainframes and machines using RISC (reduced instruction set computing) processors such as IBM's Power and Sun's Sparc. Intel once hoped Itanium would be a replacement for x86 chips such as Pentium and Xeon, but now positions the chip only as an RISC and mainframe replacement. It's a lucrative market, but not one with large numbers of unit shipments. Intel believes this will change, however. "As systems built on Itanium move into this space, you get volume economics. Standards will drive volume, and volume will drive cost and price efficiency," Otellini said. Dell's contrary position notwithstanding, Otellini argued that there always will be a place for "big iron" machines with a single operating system spanning many processors and a huge amount of memory. "Many of our computing needs can only be addressed by having these large, scale-up machines," Otellini said. "When you get down to running data warehouses or the systems that load our wafer fabs and manage all the billions of pieces of inventory running through the factory, only big single-system image machines can handle that well."
2004-06-28 - HP ponders a less-glorious Itanium future  Hewlett-Packard's server group has major plans in store for servers using Intel's Itanium processor--but also believes the company will be fine even if the chip never escapes its current high-end niche. Itanium is the foundation of HP's strategy to simplify its server portfolio: The company is moving three separate high-end server lines onto Itanium, and the Integrity product line will be able to run four operating systems. At the same time, it's expanded its lower-end ProLiant family from Intel's Xeon to include Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron as well. The way server executives see it, HP's bets are hedged. "We have decided that with the two-server strategy, ProLiant and Integrity, we're covered no matter what," said Rich Marcello, general manager of HP's Business Critical Server group. "If we do nothing more than take our Unix customers and move forward with them (on Itanium), we're fine." AMD and Intel undermined an Itanium advantage by adding 64-bit extensions to these "x86" chips used in the ProLiant family, a change that makes it easier to handle large amounts of memory. AMD made the 64-bit move in 2003 and Intel will do so Monday with a new version of Xeon code-named Nocona. HP's Itanium strategy will be "viable" even if the chip never achieves anything beyond replacing RISC (reduced instruction set computing) chips such as Sun's UltraSparc or HP's own PA-RISC, which is being phased out. Indeed, HP doesn't expect Itanium to escape that relatively narrow niche for three years, he said; after that, widespread success will depend largely on Intel marketing choices. Kevin Krewell, editor in chief of the Microprocessor Report, sees HP as trying to moderate Itanium hopes. "It's a matter of lowering expectations based on the original promises of Itanium. It really has now settled into the niche of big-iron, Unix-RISC replacement," Krewell said. And escaping a niche is hard. "Once the market has developed a perception of a product and typecast it, it gets more and more difficult to change the market perception of a product. With the cost structure involved for Itanium systems, it's hard to compete with Intel's real juggernaut, the IA-32 (x86) architecture--the Xeons, Pentiums and AMD's alternatives," Krewell said. Itanium ambitions HP and Intel once had higher hopes for Itanium, which arrived years later than hoped and has lost some of its once-broad industry support. HP invented the architecture behind Itanium then jointly designed the chip with Intel, which makes and sells it to many computer makers. Intel, though, stands behind its current long-term success plan for Itanium. "The 2007 time frame is where we're talking about system cost parity," in which Xeon and Itanium servers will use much of the same hardware and will cost the same, Intel spokesman Scott McLaughlin said. "But at the same time Itanium will have twice the performance of Xeon. That's when we start to see from an economic standpoint it becomes a lot more appealing." In HP's most recent quarter, 16 percent of its high-end server revenue came from its Itanium-based Integrity line. "We expect it to cross over to the 25 to 35 percent range by the end of the year," Marcello said. And HP genuinely can declare something of a victory if it moves customers of its disparate AlphaServer, 9000 and NSK lines to Itanium-based machines, said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. "If it can migrate that base and coalesce it around Itanium, it will have been a huge win for HP," he said. HP sells more servers than any other company, but IBM's sales of mainframes and other expensive systems gives Big Blue the server revenue lead. Sun Microsystems has been waning, but Dell continues to gain. IBM and Sun are actively trying to lure HP customers, who most often switch to new systems. HP isn't in an Itanium-holding pattern. One new system, planned for mid-2005 release, is a thin "blade" server that will plug into the same chassis that currently houses HP's x86-based blades, said Brad Anderson, general manager of HP Industry Standard Servers, which oversees x86 models and the current blade systems. Next up: Itanium 2 9M Next on the agenda is an upgraded "Madison" model of Itanium 2 called 9M that boosts high-speed cache memory from 6MB to 9MB. Though Intel released earlier Itanium models in May or June, Marcello said the Madison 9M will arrive in the fall. A likely time frame could be Intel's Developer Forum, scheduled for Sept. 7 to 9 in San Francisco, where Intel often unveils major new products and initiatives. Intel declined to comment on timing beyond reiterating plans for a launch in the second half of the year. "November or December would be late. October is probably marginal. I would expect it in the third quarter," Krewell said. After Madison 9M will come "Montecito" in mid-2005, a chip that shares the same technology to plug in to a server but otherwise is different from earlier Itanium chips. For one thing, it includes two processor cores on one slice of silicon. HP and Intel completed the Montecito design in recent weeks, Marcello said. Though Montecito could theoretically plug in to the same sockets as its predecessors, Marcello said doing so would be unlikely because it consumes more power and consequently releases more heat. Current higher-end Itaniums dissipate a maximum of 130 watts. Low-power Itanium models can go as low as 30 watts, Marcello said. The ProLiant stronghold HP's server strength remains its ProLiant line, one of the key acquisitions from Compaq Computer. HP currently has no plans to sell high-end ProLiant machines with more than eight processors, Anderson said. IBM and Unisys opted for a different strategy, with 32-processor Xeon servers on the market. Dell, the second-ranked x86 server seller, is the more imminent threat, though, and HP is fighting aggressively with price cuts. Some of the market share losses to Dell "we brought upon ourselves," Anderson said. "ProLiant was the workhorse of the portfolio. We let the price creep up because of profitability concerns." When HP found customers not even requesting bids, it took pricing action. In terms of percentages, "our pricing is now within single digits of Dell," Anderson said. Indeed, one recent study by Illuminata found HP's x86 servers were consistently less expensive than Dell's. HP accepted AMD's Opteron chip into the ProLiant line earlier this year. The company has embraced it more warmly than has IBM, which after an early lead in 2003 continues to sell Opteron systems only for the high-performance computing market, and Dell, which doesn't sell Opteron at all. The most enthusiastic Opteron server maker is Sun, which hopes its acquisition of a start-up focused on the AMD chip will help boost its tiny x86 market share. HP's Opteron blade servers will arrive in the fourth quarter, Anderson said. Opteron chips have a major advantage right now over Xeon when it comes to blades, where space constraints are tight, and overheating can cause major problems. The Opteron chips run about 20 percent cooler than corresponding Intel products, HP said. However, with future chips, that advantage "may or may not continue," Anderson said.
2003-11-03 - HP plugs Itanium server gap    Hewlett-Packard filled in an important gap in its Itanium server line Monday, releasing models that accommodate eight and 16 of the high-end Intel processors. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company already sells its top-end Superdome with as many as 64 Itaniums, as well as two- and four-processor models. But the release of the new eight-processor Integrity rx7620 and 16-processor rx8620 will help HP shore up the midrange products, where the company historically has been strong. HP is the biggest backer of the Itanium line, which it began designing in 1988. Ten years ago, it signed a deal under which Intel took over the design and built the chips itself. The company is in the process of trying to switch its Unix customers from systems based on HP's PA-RISC processor to those using the Itanium, which can run Windows and Linux as well as the HP-UX version of Unix. HP, the No. 2 player in the Unix market, should be able to maintain its midrange stronghold through the transition, said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. "Most current PA-RISC customers won't be in a big hurry to make the jump, but HP should be able to translate their current Unix product line strengths as they roll in Itanium," he said. Itanium got off to a slow start, in part because of delays and in part because software written for other Intel processors must be rewritten before it will run well on an Itanium computer. In the meantime, rivals IBM and Sun Microsystems made significant strides with their own competing processors. Itanium is on the brink of broader use, said Vish Mulchand, director of business-critical systems marketing. "We expect 2004 to be a very strong watershed year," he said. Although Dell, IBM, NEC, Unisys, Silicon Graphics and others build Itanium servers, HP has the most at stake with the new processor. It's unifying several server lines to use the processor. While it's not clear whether HP will succeed in its goal of having the chip as widely used in the industry as Intel's Xeon and Pentium processors are today, the chip appears to have settled comfortably at HP, Haff said. "Whatever questions there are around Itanium gaining broad acceptance in the market as a whole, there's no real reason to think it won't serve HP well as a PA-RISC replacement," Haff said. HP has two more generations left in its PA-RISC line. The PA-8800 "Mako" chip, which combines two of the current PA-8700 onto a single slice of silicon, is scheduled to arrive early next year, Mulchand said. The Itanium Integrity servers share many PA-RISC components, a deliberate strategy to let customers upgrade easily to Itanium. One Itanium customer is CitiStreet, a Citibank subsidiary that records financial transactions for corporate contribution plans such as 401(k)s, which has two Superdomes and five midrange HP Unix servers. CitiStreet switched to the HP Unix line in 2001 from IBM mainframes, has upgraded them through several PA-RISC processor generations and now will perform the "brain transplant" move to Itanium, Chief Information Officer Barry Strasnick said. Now that the five software packages the company needs are available for Itanium and have been tested, the company is switching processors, one server per weekend, he said. The result, based on in-house tests, will be nearly doubled performance, he said. An rx7620 with two 1.3GHz processors costs about $17,000, with average configurations probably in the $70,000 range, said Sanjiv Patel, worldwide manager for midrange products. An rx8620 has a starting price about $65,000, with most customers expected to pay between $175,000 and $200,000. HP also released several other products Monday: A new four-processor system, the rx4640, that ultimately will replace the current rx5670, Mulchand said. Its price ranges from about $10,000 to $40,000, with many customers expected to buy configurations costing between $12,000 and $15,000, he said. The new system, a rack-mountable model, is 7 inches tall, compared with 12.25 inches for the rx54670. "We've priced this significantly lower than the rx5670," he said, partly because component costs have decreased and partly because "we're trying to be aggressive in getting more adoption." A new lower-end line in the ProLiant family of Intel servers. HP has offered the lower-end 300 series, midrange 500 series and high-end 700 series; now the company is beginning a 100 series. HP customer costs for the new series by stripping out features such as sophisticated remote management, high-end disk drives, spare cooling fans or "hot swap" components that can be changed without shutting the system down, said Paul Miller, vice president of industry standard server marketing. The first 100-series product will be the dual-processor DL140 for grouping into a high-performance technical computing cluster. Each system has a starting cost of $1,299 and runs Linux from SuSE Linux or Red Hat. Later this year, HP will introduce another 100-series product, a bottom-end server for small and medium businesses. "The competition is going to be primarily whitebox guys," Miller said, referring to the low-cost unbranded systems many small-business customers buy. Two new preassembled collections of Linux servers joined in a high-performance technical computing cluster. The XC3000 uses the DL140 and has a starting price of $171,500 for a 17-node cluster; the XC6000 uses the dual-Itanium rx2600 and has a starting cost of $365,700 for a 17-node cluster. The clusters have a choice of two high-speed interconnects, Myricom's Myrinet or Quadrics' QsNet.
2002-12-05 - HP plans to take Alpha to its omega    Hewlett-Packard in January plans to release the last major update to its Alpha chip, the EV7, paving the way for the retirement of the storied high-end processor. An updated version of that chip, the EV79 will follow about 12 months later, HP executives said at a meeting this week with financial analysts. At that point, HP plans to shift Alpha into what it calls "maintenance mode," a move that will save the company hundreds of millions of dollars. The updated Alpha schedule is a slight departure from HP's previous timetable. In May, HP had said that the EV7 would debut in late 2002. HP is retiring Alpha, along with its PA-RISC processor, in favor of building systems using Intel's Itanium chip, which is based on an architecture HP helped develop. By shifting to Itanium, HP stands to save significant development costs. However, HP is betting big that Itanium sales will replace the business HP will lose from Alpha and PA-RISC based systems. Alpha and PA-RISC processors account for $5 billion in annual revenue, more than a quarter of HP's total enterprise systems business, according to Peter Blackmore, HP executive vice president. The Alpha business will lose about $200 million this fiscal year, Blackmore said. Once the final chips are out the door, HP will be able to scale back its investment and shift to what he dubbed "maintenance mode." "That will flow through to the bottom line," Blackmore said at HP's analyst meeting this week. HP said that the enterprise systems business will be less profitable than the company hoped this year, in part because of the costs of developing for three high-end chip families. The shift away from Alpha has been planned for some time. In June 2001, just three months before the merger between HP and Compaq Computer was announced, Compaq detailed plans to cease work on Alpha, transferring much of the technology to Intel. Executives have said that HP would stop coming out with new Alpha chips around the 2004 time frame and then try to get customers to migrate to Itanium systems by 2004. Although HP plans to stop developing new Alpha chips, the company has said it will keep selling Alpha-based systems as long as there is customer demand, likely until 2006. Digital Equipment developed the Alpha in 1992. While touted for its performance, the chip and servers containing it never achieved the same sort of widespread acceptance in the marketplace as competing products from Sun Microsystems, HP or IBM. Microsoft developed a version of Windows for the chip, but then canceled it because of slow sales. Compaq hoped to reverse the trend when it bought Digital in 1998, but gradually divested itself of the assets and employees behind Alpha. Although a commercial flop, Alpha's influence remains wide in the industry. Many Alpha engineers have ended up at Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, and a number of the concepts earlier championed by Digital researchers, such as multi-threading, are embodied in the latest Pentium 4 and AMD's upcoming Opteron processor. Large research institutions have been some of the biggest supporters of Alpha. Los Alamos National Laboratory uses Alpha chips in its ASCI Q supercomputer, a mammoth system with thousands of processors designed eventually to perform 30 trillion calculations per second to simulate nuclear weapons explosions.

2004-02-24 - HP plans Opteron servers AMD partnership   Hewlett-Packard announced three servers that use Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron chip and a long-term partnership with the chipmaker but strenuously argued that the move doesn't undermine servers using another processor: Intel's Itanium. HP, following IBM and Sun Microsystems, on Tuesday became the third of the four major server sellers to use AMD's processor, which has elbowed into a market that Intel has had to itself for years. HP announced two-Opteron and four-Opteron servers, as expected, and plans to sell a thin dual-Opteron blade server by the end of the third quarter. Opteron, like future Xeon and Pentium chips from Intel, adds 64-bit extensions to the widely used "x86" processor architecture, a move that dramatically expands the amount of memory a server can use. But in a conference call announcing the new servers, HP executives spent much of their time arguing that the company's embracement of 64-bit Xeon and Opteron processors doesn't detract from its commitment to Intel's competing 64-bit Itanium server processor, which HP initiated and co-developed. "These two architectures are complementing each other very well," said Scott Stallard, senior vice president of HP's Enterprise Storage and Servers group. "Our commitments to Integrity (HP's Itanium-based server line) do not change. In fact, they're strengthened by this announcement today." Some met the assertion that 64-bit x86 chips helps Itanium with skepticism. "The x86 extensions aren't necessarily a bad thing for HP. They're one of the leaders, if not the leader, in that space. But help Itanium specifically? I don't think so," said Gordon Haff, an Illuminata analyst. "Sure, Itanium's still a better choice for high-function computing, but x86 extensions clearly offer a more natural evolution to those on-the-cusp folks who just need a bit more memory and speed." AMD and HP didn't detail the extent of their partnership other than saying it will last several years and that HP will invest millions of dollars in it, said Paul Miller, vice president of industry standard server marketing for HP. The partnership is "a foundation to enable our engineers to work closely together and start defining next-generation technologies," he said. Itanium competition? HP began the Itanium project in 1988, and it and Intel have invested more than a decade of cooperative work on the design. Faced with Itanium delays and the continued success of Xeon, however, the companies are now positioning Itanium chiefly for high-end servers rather than the design that will prevail, as other architectures fall by the wayside. "I don't think x86 is running out of steam. x86 as a server platform technology seems destined to play a role forever," Stallard said. The faith in x86's longevity raised Haff's eyebrows. "I think they've hired some writers from the Soviet school of revisionist history," he said. Itanium also has a glorious history before it, Stallard said. "We've taken everything we know about computer architecture development and put it into Itanium," he said. "If you are planning out the next 15 to 20 years, we believe it will last that long (a) time." IBM and Sun, which unlike HP aren't phasing out their own high-end chips in favor of Itanium, place much more emphasis on 64-bit x86. IBM sells Itanium servers but expresses more excitement about x86, with plans for a 64-processor Xeon system in 2005. The easy software capability of 64-bit x86 with earlier x86 software means that x86 has the natural, incumbent advantage over Itanium. Sun, while late to the x86 server market, believes that it can get an edge through aggressive advancement of Opteron servers and by bringing its Solaris version of Unix to x86 servers. Stallard derided IBM for having merely a niche product, compared with HP's mainstream Opteron move. And he said Sun's software effort is late and lacks support of software companies. "Solaris on Opteron has no ecosystem and will take years to build," he said. New server details The dual-Opteron ProLiant DL145, a rack-mountable model 1.75 inches thick, will be available by March 5, Miller said. With a single 1.6GHz Opteron and 1GB of memory, it costs $1,599; upgrading to a 2.2GHz chip increases the cost to $2,999. The four-Opteron ProLiant DL585, 7 inches tall, will be available by April 9, Miller said. HP will release pricing in the next quarter. It has a maximum memory capacity of 64GB. The dual-processor models are a design from manufacturing specialist Celestica, Miller said, but the four-processor and blade models are designed by HP. The blade server, due in the third quarter, could use new low-voltage Opterons that AMD announced last week, Miller said. Low-voltage processors sacrifice some processing power in exchange for lower power consumption and less waste heat and, therefore, can be packed more densely. Ben Williams, director of AMD's server and workstation business, said the new Opteron 246 consumes 55 watts of power and that the Opteron 240 consumes 30 watts. By contrast, the higher-end Opterons consume 89 watts, he said. The Opteron systems will initially come with 32-bit versions of Windows or Linux. Within 60 to 90 days, 64-bit versions of Linux will arrive on the servers, HP said. Microsoft's 64-bit version of Windows is expected by the end of the year. AMD's Opteron currently outperforms Intel's Xeon, but HP expects the two chipmakers to leapfrog each other in coming years, Stallard said.
2003-04-29 - HP plans Itanium-Windows workstation   Hewlett-Packard, co-inventor of Intel's new Itanium processor line, will begin selling its zx2000 and zx6000 workstations with Microsoft's new Itanium version of Windows in mid-May, the company said Tuesday. The zx2000 comes with Reader Resources The 64 bit catchword TechRepublic a single 900MHz Itanium 2 with 1.5MB of high-speed cache memory and costs between $3,711 and $5,832. The zx6000 comes with one or two processors, either the 900MHz model or a 1GHz Itanium 2 with 3MB of cache, and has a price range of $6,905 to $15,135. Both systems will be available for order Thursday and will begin shipping in mid-May, company spokeswoman Jean Shimoguchi said. They use Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, which Microsoft released to manufacturers March 28. The arrival of Windows for Itanium is very important for HP, which will use the new 64-bit processor to unify server lines that today use five different processor architectures. Before Microsoft launched its new Itanium, products could run only Linux from Red Hat and SuSE, along with HP-UX, HP's version of Unix. In one illustration of the importance of Windows, HP said last week it expects the sales rate of its top-end, 64-processor Superdome server to double or triple once the version that can use Windows goes on sale later this year. HP worked with top Linux seller Red Hat to accelerate the release of an early version of its Advanced Workstation operating system, now called Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS.
2006-11-02 - HP names new high-end server chief Hewlett-Packard on Wednesday named Martin Fink as the new leader of its Itanium server group and expanded that group's role. Fink previously led HP's NonStop group, which sells super-high-end machines, and its Open-Source and Linux Operation. Now that work has become part of the expanded Business Critical Systems (BCS) group, HP said. Martin Fink Fink replaces former BCS chief Rich Marcello, who is retiring to perform volunteer work. Fink has spent the last 18 months bringing the NonStop group into alignment with BCS, whose hardware technology is now the basis of NonStop products. He said he has discussed the group's fate with Scott Stallard, who leads the Enterprise Storage and Servers group, of which BCS is a part. "I don't think we need yet another hardware computer division in this company," Fink said he told Stallard. "So we said now is the right time to combine these things into one business unit." The Linux and open-source work spans BCS, whose servers use the Itanium processor, and the Industry Standard Server group, which sells systems using x86 chips from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. HP decided to house the open-source group within BCS because much of the programming work that the company does in the area--such as supporting open-source software on Itanium servers or creating Linux version of reliability software--is done in conjunction with the higher-end servers, Fink said.
2005-05-31 - HP moves out of pre-Itanium era    Hewlett-Packard has plugged in the final pieces in its effort to replace its own PA-RISC chip with Intel's Itanium in all its high-end servers. As expected, HP on Tuesday is modernizing its NonStop models with Itanium, bringing the processor to its full server line. The NonStop move roughly doubles the performance of the high-end server family, which powers the Nasdaq's electronic stock market and Sabre Holdings' airline reservation system. At the same time, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based computer and printer maker is introducing Unix servers using the PA-8900, the last of its in-house Precision Architecture processors. HP is trying to coax customers to use comparable models based on Itanium. The PA-8900 provides about a 15 percent performance boost over its PA-8800 predecessor, which should give customers a little more time to make the shift, said Mark Hudson, a vice president of marketing in HP's Enterprise Storage and Servers group. The moves help HP simplify development of its server line, an important effort given the fierce profitability pressure on HP's server and storage group. HP server sales have been squeezed between high-end IBM designs and high-volume Dell manufacturing, but the company showed market share gains in the first quarter of 2005. HP's future processor foundation is based only on Itanium, which the company helped Intel develop, and on x86 processors such as Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron. The company has already phased out the Alpha processor used in the Unix server line from Compaq. Now NonStop customers have an alternative to models that use Silicon Graphics' MIPS processors. End of the PA era HP introduced the Precision Architecture family in 1986, helping to pioneer the reduced instruction set computing (RISC) approach to designing higher-performance processors. Now that lineage is coming to an end. "It's the last stop. Everybody off the bus," said Kevin Krewell, an analyst and editor in chief of the Microprocessor Report. But the PA-8900 is barely different from the PA-8800, a comparatively radical design that squeezed dual processing cores onto a single slice of silicon. Both use the same manufacturing process with 130-nanometer features. However, the PA-8900 has a top speed of 1.1GHz to the PA-8800's 1GHz. The biggest difference is that PA-8900 connects to 64MB of cache, or external high-speed memory--twice the capability of the PA-8800. "Calling it the 8900 is a stretch of the imagination. It's really the 8800 with a small plus after it," Krewell said. "The 8800 was the bang. This was the echo." Two major RISC families are still under active development for the server market: Power from IBM, and Sparc from Sun Microsystems and Fujitsu. Those competitors have been eagerly pouncing on HP's PA-RISC customers. HP is introducing the PA-8900 processor across the full HP 9000 Unix server line. New NonStops NonStop machines link numerous smaller machines together into a single large system, an approach that's not simple, but that provides high performance and reliability. The machines have used MIPS processors for years. They used them even before Compaq acquired Tandem, the company that originally designed the server line, in 1997--which means way before HP acquired Compaq in 2002. The NonStop Enterprise Division is profitable, but HP hopes the Itanium models will help increase revenue, Hudson said. "We do see this as a business we are expecting to see continued revenue growth in. There is a large installed-base play, but there are also new areas and growth areas we're seeing," he added. Selling NonStop machines also helps HP sell other servers, services and storage gear. "It is a key tenant in many of our top accounts," Hudson said. Other changes with the NonStop line: They can use HP's top-end XP12000 storage systems and, like the rest of HP's server lines, can be controlled by HP's Systems Insight Manager software, said Bob Sawyer, marketing manager for the NonStop division.
2003-11-08 - HP merges management software lines    Hewlett-Packard is merging several management tools into a single product code-named Nimbus--a move that could boost its utility computing effort as well as a strategy that relies on Intel's Itanium processor. Nimbus will present a unified way for administrators to control systems that run Windows, Linux or HP's version of Unix, called HP-UX, according to HP presentations CNET News.com has seen. The software, due to arrive by the end of 2003, includes components taken from both HP and Compaq Computer, which HP acquired in 2002. Get Up to Speed on... Utility computing Get the latest headlines andcompany-specific news in ourexpanded GUTS section. Managing multiple operating systems is important for HP, because its Itanium servers can simultaneously run Windows, Linux and HP-UX, which means that the company doesn't have to design as many different types of computers. And glossing over the differences between the systems could make it easier to overlay the more sophisticated management software of HP's utility computing plan, called Adaptive Enterprise. Indeed, Nimbus likely will be featured Tuesday when Peter Blackmore, executive vice president of HP's enterprise systems group, talks about developments with the Adaptive Management component of its broader vision. Eliminating the management headaches of dealing with different operating systems gets HP closer to "something that actually benefits customers as opposed to HP's development costs," said Gordon Haff, an analyst at Illuminata. HP has high hopes for Nimbus as a way to reduce one of the biggest costs customers face today: managing servers and migrating from one server design to another. Migration costs are a big concern for HP as it tries to steer Unix customers with servers based on HP's PA-RISC processor to the new HP Itanium-based Integrity line. "Nimbus is going to be one of those redefining architectures" that will change how HP can approach customers, said Paul Miller, vice president of HP's industry standard server marketing. With multi-operating system management software, the problems that slow Itanium adoption today "all of a sudden don't become barriers anymore," he said. "If you can take an HP-UX application running on PA-RISC today, plug in an Itanium server, and nothing changes about how they manage it, that's a powerful story," Miller said. But HP will also have challenges in wrestling several components into one system. "Have they got a portfolio consolidation nightmare on their hands? Absolutely," said James Governor, a RedMonk analyst. The three progenitors to Nimbus are Insight Manager, Windows management software from Compaq, Toptools Device Manager from HP and Servicecontrol Manager from HP. The Nimbus software could help simplify a layer of HP's Darwin Reference Architecture, the collection of utility computing components the company plans to assemble as a way to help customers achieve a fluid computing system that can quickly respond to changing requirements. Nimbus "provides a certain level of abstraction of the underlying hardware, so this Adaptive Enterprise provisioning and virtualization can then talk to this relatively consistent interface," Haff said. Provisioning is the process of directing a computer to run particular software; virtualization makes it easier to move software from one computer to another. Another challenge for Nimbus is that Unix and Linux administrators have different styles and different needs than Windows administrators, Governor said. "They have different expectations of what tools look like," he added. But HP is a step ahead of some competitors, because its management software is relatively lightweight and is designed to accomplish specific tasks rather than everything under the sun, Governor said. HP avoided the grand but ultimately unpopular "framework" management software visions that were espoused by Computer Associates International, BMC Software and IBM.
2002-01-16 - HP McKinley servers will beat Merced   DUBLIN, Ireland--Servers based on the second iteration of Intel's 64-bit Itanium processor, code-named McKinley, will offer twice the performance at half the price of first-generation machines, according to an executive at Hewlett-Packard, which is developing a new McKinley-friendly chipset. At a press event here this week, HP's Itanium program manager, Marc Botherel, said a decrease in chip prices together with advances in other hardware will have a massive effect on pricing. McKinley is due to ship toward the end of the first half of 2002, although demonstration units are already being installed inside corporations. Chief among the hardware developments will be HP's "Pluto" chipset, which will support the company's own 64-bit PA-RISC processors as well as McKinley. "Pluto will be cheap to produce," said Bothorel. "The processors will be cheaper too, but the big savings will come from sharing designs between commercial servers and technical workstations." Workstations and servers tend to use different chipsets and so need different motherboards, a situation that can raise prices. Pluto, though, will have an AGP graphics bus, a direct connection between the graphics chip and the main processor, said Bothorel. This means that it can be used in workstations, which come with complex graphics chips, as well as in servers, which don't really need much in the way of graphics. "Pluto will be the first 64-bit chipset to support AGP," Bothorel said. Ambidexterity in chipsets is a growing trend. IBM's Summit chipset works with the 64-bit McKinley and with standard Xeon processors, which can only handle data in 32-bit chunks. Such internal architectural changes are likely to help Itanium find a wider audience. The first Itanium processor, based on the Merced core, received a lukewarm welcome from customers. Only 2,600 Itanium servers shipped in the second and third quarter, according to Gartner, while IDC puts the figure at closer to 500. Most of the companies that have bought Itanium systems have been using them in pilot projects. Thomas Ullrich, marketing manager for Unix systems at HP, said McKinley will fare better because it will have a full software stack. "People will start to push it out in production environments," said Ullrich. "It will take a year to really build up credibility. In 2003 we will start to see broad market adoption." Costs will also drop as system sizes decrease. Manufacturers will be able to produce McKinley servers that are significantly smaller than servers based on the earlier version of Itanium, the "Merced." HP rack-mounted servers based on Itanium are 7U high, but when McKinley servers go into production, HP will be selling them in 2U packages. One U equals 1.75 inches. Some of the speed increases meanwhile will come from the McKinley processor itself. This processor will have a 128-bit memory bus instead of the 64-bit bus of the Merced Itanium. The cache will also move onto the die for McKinley. Matt Loney reported from Dublin.
2004-12-03 - HP leans on Veritas for Unix boost Hewlett-Packard, faced with delays integrating technology from Compaq Computer's version of Unix into its own, said Thursday it will instead rely on software from Veritas. HP will incorporate into its HP-UX operating system elements of Veritas software used for linking computers working together in a tight grouping called a cluster. Previously, HP had been trying to add features called TruCluster and Advanced File System from Tru64 Unix, the operating system HP acquired in 2002 from Compaq, which in turn acquired it in 1998 from original developer Digital Equipment Corporation. "We are scrapping it," said Rich Marcello, general manager of HP's business critical server group. "The original schedule called for delivery of that technology right now. We slipped to mid-2006...It would probably be mid-2007 before people could take advantage of it in production environments." At the same time that HP had delays on its own project, Veritas technology had largely caught up with what TruCluster offers, Marcello said. In addition, Veritas software is widely used among HP Unix customers and works with Linux as well as Unix, he said. The Veritas software will be incorporated into HP's Serviceguard cluster software product. Sun Microsystems, HP's main rival in the Unix server market along with IBM, has based a marketing campaign on HP's delays in bringing the Tru64 features to HP-UX, a move important to HP's attempt to retain its Tru64 customers. All those customers have to switch to some new system at some point, and Sun and IBM are trying to get the business. HP is scaling back some of its businesses to try to become more competitive. It announced earlier in November a plan to cut some of its 150,000 employees by the end of April, a restructuring program that will cost about $200 million. Overall, however, HP expects to add more staff. Also as a result of the deal announced Thursday, Veritas advanced its schedule to support HP-UX on Intel's Itanium processors; previously the software was available only for HP-UX running on HP's PA-RISC chips, which are being gradually phased out. The Veritas software will be available for HP servers using both chips in the third quarter of 2005; previously Veritas had planned on the end of 2005 or 2006, said Sanjay Poonen, vice president of strategic alliances for Veritas. Financial terms of the deal weren't released. The clustering software is part of HP's Virtual Server Environment, technology designed to let customers increase or decrease computing resources allocated to specific tasks as workloads grow or shrink. HP has nearly brought the version of HP-UX for its Itanium-based Integrity line of servers to parity with the version for its PA-RISC based HP 9000 line, Marcello said. The last major piece missing from the Itanium version is virtual partitions, or vPars, a mechanism to divide a single server so it can run several independent operating systems, Marcello said. That feature should arrive in the first half of 2005, he said. The next update, HP-UX 11i version 3, is due in 2006, Marcello said. It will have improvements in multiprocessor support as well as the ability to run simultaneous instruction sequences called threads.
2002-06-26 - HP jump-starts Red Hat's Itanium agenda    Hewlett-Packard's strong backing for Intel's Itanium processor line has accelerated Red Hat's plans to create a version of its flagship Advanced Server Linux for the high-end chip family. Red Hat sells a version of the Linux operating system for Itanium systems, but hadn't planned to move Advanced Server to Itanium until late 2003. But HP, the co-inventor of the Itanium family, persuaded the company to advance the schedule by about a year, a Red Hat executive said. "We did pull in our timing for support of Itanium 2 systems, based on the HP business and technical partnership (with Red Hat) that was announced recently," Mike Evans, vice president for business development at the Linux company, confirmed this week. Red Hat also advanced the schedule for a workstation version, used by technical people such as chip designers and programmers, Evans said. Both products are expected in early fall of 2002. The changes illustrate the behind-the-scenes deals that can make the difference between a new technology catching on or fizzling out--even technology backed by giants such as Intel. And HP, which created the idea behind the Itanium line then handed off the design to Intel to commercialize, arguably has at least as much riding on Itanium as Intel does. HP is moving its entire server line to Itanium over the next few years; the last new models of its older PA-RISC processor family will arrive in 2004. The success of its Itanium products--everything from workstations to million-dollar multiprocessor servers--depends in large measure on how well software runs on the new chips. These servers, in turn, drive sales of services, software and storage systems. Intel's Itanium family, a still-immature product line that has been afflicted by years of delays, is a 64-bit chip line that's more sophisticated but very different from 32-bit Intel chips such as Pentium and Xeon. The first serious Itanium family products are expected to begin arriving as soon as next month when the second-generation Itanium 2 debuts. Red Hat isn't the only Itanium partnership HP has been working on. BEA Systems, which sells software for running Java e-commerce programs, will first debut its WebLogic Itanium product on HP-UX, HP's version of Unix. On Tuesday, though, BEA announced it's working to design its Java engine for use on several different operating systems on Itanium 2. HP started discussing the Linux work with Red Hat in October, said Clifford Loeb, alliances manager for HP's Linux business development organization and the person who led HP's talks with Red Hat. "We can make the market in this and help drive Linux into the enterprise with Advanced Server technology," Loeb said. Advancing Red Hat's Itanium agenda helps to ensure that core operating system software is in place for customers who are considering buying Itanium, or for software makers, such as database companies, that are trying to decide when to support Itanium. A helping hand Red Hat is particularly important because it employs many programmers who work on the GCC "compiler," software that translates human-written programs into instructions that a computer can understand. Sophisticated compilers are key to taking advantage of Itanium's design. HP requires all the help it can get to accomplish what it needs as it converges its own servers and those it acquired from Compaq Computer onto the Itanium. The company is backing three major operating systems for Itanium--Windows, Linux and its HP-UX version of Unix--as well as two more specialized ones, OpenVMS and NonStop Kernel. "I think the general consensus is that (the 64-bit version of) Windows...is not yet ready for prime time at the high end of the market. The proprietary HP-UX clearly is, and Linux is a wild card," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. "HP, by making this move, covers all three bases." In comparison, rival Sun Microsystems pushes its own UltraSparc processors and its Solaris version of Unix for all but low-end servers. IBM, while boosting Linux on its Intel servers and Power4 processors, canceled development and sales of an Itanium version of its AIX Unix product. Red Hat's Advanced Server, which debuted in May, changes less frequently and has higher-end features than preceding versions of the company's software. It's designed to appeal to software companies and, indeed, database software giant Oracle and others have strongly endorsed Advanced Server. Red Hat also planned a comparable high-end workstation product, which was scheduled to debut in March 2003 on 32-bit Intel systems, Loeb said, but HP convinced Red Hat not only to create an Itanium version but also to introduce it first, this year. Red Hat's current Itanium versions of Linux have been more popular on workstations than on servers, Evans said, but the company expects demand for both products to increase as Itanium 2 computers arrive. "We saw increasing demand from customers migrating from Unix for 64-bit capabilities," Evans said. "We also saw HP making bold market commitments for their upcoming Itanium-based systems. Having product in the market ahead of Windows is an added bonus." Whether Red Hat will beat Windows to market is debatable. Microsoft will release version 1.2 of its Limited Edition version of Windows for Itanium in July, said Velle Kolde, lead product manger for Windows 64-bit server products. You scratch my back... HP and Red Hat declined to disclose terms of their deal, but both companies said the partnership would make money. "This partnership has a lot of real positive benefits for both companies," Loeb said. "It improves Linux for our customers, makes the market better and drives revenue for both companies." Red Hat leads the Linux market, according to market analysis firm IDC, and in North America, Red Hat is the only game in town, Loeb said. Red Hat said the HP partnership increases costs for the company, but it expects "the revenue to exceed any costs in the efforts," Evans said. The Itanium development, testing, marketing, sales and support work are closely aligned with the other Intel software, he said. "The tighter alliance and relationship with Red Hat...makes a ton of sense," said Giga Information Group analyst Brad Day. The next question is how well HP will support Linux versions of its higher-level Unix software for tasks such as tying computing resources to specific tasks. Triggering competitive instincts The HP partnership also could advance Red Hat's position compared with Microsoft and competitors in the Unix world such as Sun and IBM. Itanium is increasing Red Hat's ambition. Evans calls the processor a "nice extension" to Linux's core market on 32-bit Intel and Advanced Micro Devices' processors. "I am seeing a 'Linux fabric' taking hold in the computing infrastructure, and the Unix variants are starting to smell more and more like VMS"--a high-quality operating system that's consigned to a small niche. Microsoft sells its Limited Edition version of Windows for Itanium systems and later this year will sell a full-fledged product. Both are based on the "Whistler" code base that debuted with Windows XP for desktop computers. Although some features are missing from the Limited Edition, such as the ability to run older 16-bit code, the Limited Edition product is a "full-featured server operating system," Kolde said. Microsoft has been working on Itanium products since 1996 and initially booted its operating system on the first Itanium prototypes in August 1999. It released a beta version of its SQL Server database program in February 2002, Kolde said. Windows .Net server, the sweeping overhaul to Windows 2000, is scheduled to debut on Itanium and other Intel processors in the second half of 2002. But some see the Windows version as lagging Linux. "There's been a lot of good development put into the Limited Edition, but it's very much what I would characterize as paint that's yet to dry," said analyst Day. "I think Linux is a little further along." AMD, Intel's closest rival, is taking a different course in tackling 64-bit computing with its Hammer line. Through a partnership with German Linux seller SuSE and others, AMD sees Linux as a tool to help its chip catch on. Linux will also appear on 64-bit desktops with AMD's upcoming Hammer chips next year, said Ed Ellett, vice president of marketing at AMD. "You will see Linux-based desktop applications in the 2003 time frame" that take advantage of Hammer's 64-bit capabilities, Ellett said. Most likely, these will be marketed as workstations, where 64-bit applications and Linux are already popular. Within one-and-a-half to three years, though, 64-bit applications could become commonplace on desktops because of the decreasing price of memory, AMD asserts. A major advantage of 64-bit chips is their ability to address large amounts of memory. But for all the challenges Intel faces with Itanium, it has a major leg up over AMD because millions of Intel servers already ship. They're low-end systems for the most part, but AMD is only getting started. HP certainly has its strategy mapped out. Itanium systems may not be popular today, Loeb said, but "Linux and Advanced Server availability is going to help cross the chasm for the Itanium processor family." News.com's Michael Kanellos contributed to this report.
2003-08-27 - HP Itanium supercomputer up and running    A Hewlett-Packard supercomputer at is fully operational, HP said Tuesday. The system is capable of performing 11.8 trillion calculations per second and is geared for chemistry, climatology and molecular science research. The system uses 1,984 of Intel's 1.5GHz Itanium 2 "Madison" processors. An earlier version with 1.0GHz "McKinley" Itanium processors was ranked at No. 8 on a list of the 500 fastest supercomputers, and HP expects that ranking to climb now that the system has been completed.
2005-02-11 - HP Intel tussle with Oracle over dual-core chips   As they develop their dual-core-processor strategies, Intel and Hewlett-Packard appear to be rounding on a common target they see as hampering their ambitions: database giant Oracle. Intel plans to launch its first dual-core processor in the second quarter of this year, in the shape of the Pentium Processor Extreme Edition. This will be followed by Montecito, a dual-core version of its Itanium server chip, and future multicore versions of Pentiums, Xeons and Itaniums that will have up to 32 cores each. But hardware vendors are worried that traditional models for software licenses will restrict sales of their multicore offerings. The problem, they say, is that as more logic cores are squeezed into each chip, the software licenses will increase in cost accordingly--but out of all proportion to the cost of the hardware. "Oracle is probably the most misaligned," Intel enterprise marketing manager Shannon Poulin told journalists on Thursday. "They have focused on licensing by core, but we're trying hard to have them see things the way we do." HP, which has been involved in the development of the Itanium processor since the beginning and which recently transferred 250 chip designers to Intel, is also piling the pressure on Oracle, according to Peter Kraft, HP's director of business-critical systems. "We have meetings twice a year with our biggest customers," said Kraft. "These meetings last almost a week, and we invite people from Intel, Oracle and so on. The question that comes up in every meeting to Oracle is, 'When will you change your licensing scheme?'" Although the common plea to Oracle regards virtualization, Kraft said, the company's multicore strategy is also a cause for concern. "The processor is not a fixed entity anymore, as it was. The world's changing, and Oracle has to change with it," said Kraft, who believes Oracle will eventually rethink its approach to licensing. Oracle doesn't see it that way, however. In an e-mailed statement, the company's Jacqueline Woods said, "We don't have a position with respect to dual-core processors. A core is equal to a CPU (central processing unit), and all cores are required to be licensed. Therefore, if you have a dual-core processor, you are required to have two processor licenses. A core is equal to a CPU, and all cores are required to be licensed." Woods said Oracle has no plans to change its licensing strategy. "We have not increased our prices. At the end of the day, the consumption of the Oracle software is unchanged." Oracle is not the only software company alarming the hardware vendors. Intel's Shannon pointed to BEA as another software company that doesn't yet see software licensing on dual-core systems the same way Intel does. "BEA is an in-betweener," he said. "They're talking about licensing on the basis of 1.25 times (the price of a license on a single-core CPU) rather than two times." But, he added, Intel has "thousands of engineers sitting at these companies to make sure that their licensing works for customers." BEA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. And Microsoft still has some way to go in the eyes of the hardware vendors, particularly in on-demand computing, where processors are switched on--and paid for--according to workload. "If you buy a box with 32 processors, you can pay HP only for what you use, but you still have to buy 32 full licenses from Microsoft and Oracle," said Intel's Kraft. "This might change in the future, but there are so many licensing schemes available now, that it is really confusing for the customer."
2003-01-20 - HP IBM unveil new servers  Top server makers announced a bevy of new servers Monday as Hewlett-Packard describes its first four-processor "blade" system and IBM overhauls a midrange product line with a new processor and a method to accommodate computing surges. Blade servers began as thin, lower-end systems that would stack side by side within the same chassis--the way books are arranged in a bookshelf. HP's new four-processor blades, though, similar to the "modular computing" products from rival Dell Computer, are more like bricks. Two of the BL40p systems can fit side by side in an enclosure 19 inches wide and 10.5 inches tall, an enclosure that also could be used to house eight of HP's existing two-processor BL20p blades, said James Mouton, vice president for platforms in HP's Industry Standard Server group. Blade pioneers Egenera and RLX Technologies took different perspectives on the new system. Egenera, which has been selling four-processor blades since March, touted its approach, in which each blade loses its individual identity so that tasks can easily be shuffled from one blade to another. And RLX, the first to the blade market, doesn't plan to release any blades larger than two-processor systems, saying that the price, size and features of four-processor systems remove them too far from the blade idea of numerous, easy-to-switch-out computers. Dell and IBM, however, are headed the same direction as HP and Egenera. Servers, the machines running round-the-clock to handle everything from bank transactions to e-mail, are pricey, powerful systems. With the collapse of the Internet mania, server sales have been shrinking for the past two years, but researchers at Gartner Group expect the market to return to growth in 2003. The new four-processor systems use Intel's new Xeon MP processors, code-named Gallatin, and will be available to order on March 11 with a starting price of $8,999. The company also announced a new BL20p blade server using the Pentium 4-based Xeon chip instead of the Pentium III, with prices starting at $3,399. Finally, the lower-end, single-processor BL10e--20 of which fit into a 5.25-inch tall enclosure--now has a 900MHz Pentium III processor where the previous model ran at 800MHz. The new BL10e costs $1,859 and up. The new blade systems come with the ability to connect with the Fibre Channel high-speed network technology to link to remote storage systems, an important stage in making blade servers more versatile and in weaning designs from the necessity of including their own hard drives. IBM, meanwhile, will begin start selling on Feb. 21 an overhauled iSeries line, systems that share processors with IBM's pSeries Unix line but with many of architectural features of Big Blue's top end zSeries line. The overhaul brings the top-end Power4 processor that previously was only on the 32-processor i890 to several lower-end systems, the eight- or 16-processor i870 with a $550,000 starting price and the three- or six-processor i825 with a $125,000 starting price. The i890, i870 and i825 will sport a new "capacity upgrade on demand" feature, which will let customers buy a system with more processors installed than typically are needed, paying for the extra processing power as it's needed to accommodate spikes in usage, said Al Zollar, newly appointed general manager of IBM's iSeries servers. IBM also introduced two low-end models, the single processor i800 and i810, with starting prices of $10,000 and $22,000, respectively. IBM also began a program to ship its server software built into the systems at a significant discount to buying it separately, Zollar said. The program includes WebSphere e-commerce software, the DB2 database software, the Tivoli management software and other packages. The price tag can increase anywhere from $10,000 to $3 million for the software, depending on what's selected and what server it's running on, but for high-end configurations that's a discount of about $400,000, Zollar said. HP also made moves at the high end of a server line it inherited through its acquisition of Compaq Computer. It released a new GS1280, a 64-processor Unix server using a major new version of the Alpha chip called EV7. The EV7 and a faster derivative called EV79 coming in 2004 will be the last in the Alpha line as HP tries to switch customers over to Intel's Itanium processor. Customers include Dollar Rent A Car Systems, which uses them for Oracle databases that handle 10 million to 20 million transactions per day. Eight- and 16-processor GS1280s are shipping now, with a 32-processor version due midyear and the full-bore 64-processor model by year's end. HP also announced the eight-processor ES80 and the four-processor ES47 models using the EV7 chip. All the new models can be split into several independent "partitions" as small as two processors and each running its own copy of the operating system.
2002-05-09 - HP holds on to some Evo workstations   Hewlett-Packard continues to work out its workstation product plans. The company, which closed its multibillion-dollar merger with Compaq on Friday and announced its post-merger product plans Tuesday, originally had said that only its future workstation product line would carry the HP brand. The implication was that the company would phase out Compaq's Evo workstation line. HP now says that it plans to offer a total of four workstations. It will keep some of Compaq's midrange and low-priced workstations even as it does away with the Evo W8000, a high-end machine based on Intel Xeon chips, in favor of a similarly designed, new dual-processor product that includes elements of both the W8000 and HP's own x4000. The new dual-processor workstation will become HP's highest-performance model available. HP will continue to manufacture the Compaq Evo W6000 and Evo W4000, with no design changes, but it will re-brand them as HP products that emphasize more affordable performance and a lower price, respectively, a company representative said. Meanwhile, HP will combine its x1100 and x2100 workstations into one workstation, a single processor offering that will be a step up from the current W4000. HP will continue offering the current workstations for their originally planned product life cycles. A workstation is a beefed-up desktop PC, developed for use by engineers or designers who are creating products or rendering graphics. The machines, which generally cost a bit more than a desktop, use the best-available components and often support dual processors. The workstation market has suffered along with the PC market, which declined by about 5 percent during 2001. Workstation shipments for the first quarter of 2002 dropped by 5.4 percent worldwide from the first quarter of 2001, due in part to the slow economy, according to a recent report by Gartner. HP's workstation strategy fits with its plans for other products such as servers, which is to offer the strongest possible post-merger product lineup, without regard to which company designed which products. When it comes to servers, for example, HP has said that it will keep Compaq's ProLiant line of servers, but re-brand them as HP ProLiant. The ProLiant industry-standard server, a machine based on Intel chips and the Windows or Linux operating system, is No. 1 in market share in its category. However, HP will phase out Compaq's Itanium-based ProLiant machine in favor of its own next-generation Itanium 2 machine.
2001-10-25 - HP fighting back in Unix server wars   Hewlett-Packard has been struggling in the Unix server market, but the company plans a counterattack on Sun Microsystems and IBM with a new server featuring twice as many processors as HP's current top-end Superdome. In 2003, HP will upgrade its 64-processor Superdome with a 128-processor goliath using HP's PA-RISC 8800 chips, said Mark Hudson, worldwide marketing manager for HP's business systems and technology organization. The 8800 chips combine two CPUs on a single slice of silicon, a technique pioneered by IBM with its new Power4 chip. The mammoth system and a host of upcoming related models are the foundation of HP's attempt to boost its Unix server business, and to a certain extent the entire company, at a pivotal time. The company is struggling with plunging revenue, massive layoffs, the acquisition of Compaq Computer and conflicts between the company and its Unix server sales partners. HP, the No. 2 Unix server seller according to sales figures from research firm IDC, is seeking to fend off a newly scrappy IBM in third place while assaulting Sun Microsystems, still the top dog of the Unix server market but now vulnerable during the economic slump. "While the perception is that the Unix server market is now effectively a two-horse race between Sun and IBM, this simply does not stand up to scrutiny," SG Cowen Securities analyst Richard Chu wrote in a recent report. "In part because of very weak demand from the very markets that propelled Sun (telecommunications, dot-com, broadband and service providers), the combined HP-Compaq entity is likely to emerge with a somewhat more significant footprint in Unix servers circa 2002." The server line is key for HP: Sales of the powerful machines tend to draw along sales of services, storage and software, three areas where HP is seeking to increase its revenue most strongly. Servers have better profit margins than hardware such as printers or PCs. And with Compaq discarding its Alpha-based Unix server designs in favor of Itanium systems, HP's Unix server division is free to move as fast as it can as HP tries to swallow Compaq. But HP has perseverance, and a Superdome successor could arrive during cheerier economic times. "HP introduced Superdome about one month before the bottom fell out from under dot-coms, and we've had worsening economic conditions ever since," said Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice. "It was a terrible misfortune, but the large server space is a marathon, not a sprint. HP is not giving up." Time to attack Sun And it's a good time to be going after Sun. Though the Unix server leader is benefiting from the September introduction of its 106-processor Starcat, it's suffering financially, with a 43-percent revenue drop in its most recent quarter. "It is still too early to determine if weak bookings will come back in the December quarter--our own belief is that a recovery in orders will be delayed until the June quarter," UBS Warburg analyst Don Young wrote in a recent report on Sun. Morgan Stanley's Rebecca Runkle said there are "no hints that demand will significantly improve over the next few quarters." In the top end of the Unix server market--machines that cost $1 million and up--IBM and HP made gains, while Sun lost out in the second quarter, according to IDC. IBM's revenue increased from $154 million a year ago to $204 million, while HP's increased from $110 million to $150 million. Sun, meanwhile, saw revenue shrink from, $515 million to $390 million. Sun's lead is still commanding, but instead of sales more than triple the next competitor's, they're less than double. CPU count isn't everything Processor count is but one part of the total measure of the power of a system. "Stupendous processor counts are not what separates the men from the boys in Big Iron--input-output (speed) and manageability is," Eunice said. Indeed, with programs such as Oracle's database software, which cost tens of thousands of dollars for each CPU on which it's used, it makes economic sense to have smaller systems. That issue, combined with the expense of building machines with oodles of CPUs and ancillary chips, led IBM to discard the idea of a 128-processor machine in favor of one with fewer CPUs and more communication capability. HP's Hudson agrees with IBM's methodology. But a 128-processor system still is worthwhile, he argued. For one thing, technical computing customers with heavy-duty calculations such as automotive design need the larger systems. More important, though, is that these gargantuan Unix servers can be divided into several independent partitions, each one an independent server. The technology, first introduced in Unix servers by Sun but now used by HP and IBM, means numerous smaller servers can be replaced by a larger, easier to manager machine. More processors means more partitions and thus more consolidation, Hudson said. The effect is multiplied because HP's designs will be able to run Windows and Linux as well as its HP-UX version of Unix. Itanium trickling into Unix line HP's server line has other products to look forward to besides a new top-end Superdome. Some of the changes are based on the arrival of Intel's Itanium processor family, initially invented by HP but co-developed and now built by Intel. Superdome will accommodate Itanium chips, but HP has pushed back the scheduled arrival date, Hudson said. Initially, HP said the Itanium-based Superdomes would be on sale in the second half of 2002, but now the systems could arrive as late as early 2003. These systems will use the "best available" Itanium family chip--either the second-generation "McKinley" or its smaller and faster successor, "Madison," Hudson said. Intel spokeswoman Barbara Grimes said Madison will be built using a manufacturing process with 130-nanometer (0.13-micron) features, a notch smaller than the 180-nanometer process of the McKinley line. Madison also will come with 6MB of high-speed "cache" memory instead of McKinley's 3MB. The much-delayed Itanium family from Intel is a more powerful 64-bit design that's a radical departure from the 32-bit Celeron, Pentium and Xeon designs. So far, Itanium machines are chiefly used by a few technical researchers and those wishing to prepare software for the day when the systems could be more popular. Many analysts believe Intel, with its vast manufacturing capacity, will be able to sell Itaniums more cheaply than prevailing high-end server chips such as HP's PA-RISC, Sun's UltraSparc and IBM's Power. But with Itanium's delays and difficulties, that prospect still is years away. Hudson said HP expects revenue from Itanium-based servers to surpass current PA-RISC systems in 2004. It's a long-term strategy, Hudson said, but the design behind Itanium will last 20 years, he predicted. More servers in the pipeline Itanium family chips will first appear in traditional HP Unix servers in mid-2002, when four-processor L-class systems will accommodate McKinley designs, Hudson said. HP already sells two- and four-processor Itanium machines, but those systems can't accommodate HP's PA-RISC chips. At the end of the year, HP's new PA-RISC 8700 chip will arrive in the L-class. And in mid-2002 comes "Olympic," a 16-processor Itanium system whose design HP licensed from NEC. Perhaps more significant will be "bladed" designs, the naked motherboards that are stacked into a single enclosure like books in a bookshelf, allowing companies to fit more servers in a limited space. In contrast, most designs these days have only one server in each enclosure. Bladed designs save floor space and energy, Hudson said, but a more important factor will be improvements to how easily the systems can be assigned en masse to different tasks and managed, Hudson said. HP's first Intel-based blade designs, two-processor models, will arrive near the end of 2001, he said, while two-processor Unix server blades will arrive in mid-2002, Hudson said. Is anyone listening? Selling these systems will be difficult if HP continues to suffer from its also-ran image, though. "Regaining mind share in the Unix server market has been elusive for HP," SG Cowen's Chu wrote. HP is tackling the problem with a high-level marketing campaign, Hudson said. The company will use an ad campaign, direct mail, seminars and other activities. "I think you'll see HP be much more visible," Hudson said.
2003-06-26 - HP expands SuSE Linux deal Hewlett-Packard is expanding its Linux server software menu with additional wares from SuSE Linux. SuSE said on Thursday that the computer giant would begin offering the SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8 on HP servers running Intel processors. Customers could already buy SuSE's Linux on HP servers; they will now be able to buy them with the latest version--SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8, released in November--preinstalled. The deal applies to HP's ProLiant line, which chiefly uses Intel's Xeon chips, and to its servers based on Itanium chips. In addition, HP will provide technical support to customers purchasing a server with the software preloaded, SuSE said in a statement. The move strengthens the relationships between HP and the German software maker, whose United States headquarters is in Oakland, Calif. But it also reflects a general rise in stature for Linux-based servers, sales of which continue to increase in step with the adoption of the Linux operating system among businesses, educational institutions and governments. The deal, like HP's pact with SuSE rival Red Hat in March, updates the companies' ties after HP's merger with Compaq. Previously, SuSE had only a "general cooperation" agreement with Compaq, and the Linux seller's software would only be installed by special agreement, SuSE spokesman Joe Eckert said. In addition, there was no joint marketing activity. HP will take care of customer support calls, though SuSE technicians will manage the most severe, "level 3," issues, Eckert added. HP offers a broad range of choices when it comes to Linux, in addition to the software offered through its Red Hat relationship. HP had also certified that its servers worked with the UnitedLinux consortium's version of Linux--based on SuSE's software and also used by Turbolinux in Japan and Conectiva in Brazil. Working closely with HP is a big deal for SuSE and any of its Linux software cohorts. But offering Linux has benefited server manufacturers as well. Though still small compared to overall server revenue, Linux server revenue has grown steadily. In the first quarter of this year, for instance, it rose 35 percent to $583 million, according to IDC.
2002-12-11 - HP enlists Linux supercomputer ally    Hewlett-Packard has signed a partnership with Linux Networx under which each company will use technology from the other for lower-cost supercomputers, the companies plan to announce Wednesday. Linux Networx will use HP's Itanium 2 servers as components in its systems, while HP will use the start-up's Clusterworx software to help manage supercomputers made of interconnected smaller systems. Clusterworx handles tasks such as installing software simultaneously on several computers, monitoring processor usage, and taking automatic actions such as shutting off a computer if a fan fails. For Intel, supercomputing is a good market in which to try to secure customers for its still-new Itanium processor family, which works very differently from the established Celeron-Pentium-Xeon lineage and thus requires software to be rewritten. Supercomputer customers are willing to pay a premium for better mathematical abilities--which Itanium possesses in spades--and often run their own programs, so they aren't as dependent on outside software companies to provide support. HP has bet its entire server line on the Itanium family, which it helped to develop, while supercomputer niche companies such as Quadrics have begun supporting the new chips. Supercomputers traditionally have been expensive, highly customized designs purchased by a select group of customers, but the industry is being overhauled by comparatively mainstream technologies such as Intel processors, InfiniBand high-speed connections, and Fibre Channel storage networks that have become fast enough to accomplish many tasks. The new breed of supercomputers usually involve numerous two-processor servers bolted into racks and joined with special high-speed networks into a "cluster." Linux Networx customers include Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories for nuclear weapons research, Boeing for aeronautic engineering, and Sequenom for genetics research. The new servers from Salt Lake City-based Linux Networx will be available beginning in January, a representative said. The company will use both HP's two-processor rx2600 and its four-processor rx5670. For its part, HP argues that using the Linux Networx software will lower the overall cost to run supercomputing clusters.
2011-11-23 - HP edges away from Itanium adds x86 to servers HP has said it will add x86 capabilities to its Itanium-based range of servers in a project code-named Odyssey. The scheme, announced by the company on Wednesday, will see HP develop software and hardware to make x86 chips a better fit for high-end workloads that are typically dealt with by Intel's IA-64 Itanium processor. HP will make a new range of x86 blade servers that will fit inside the HP Superdome 2 and Itanium versions of the c-Class server chassis. These blades are codenamed DragonHawk and HydraLynx, respectively. The company will also bring some high-end features from its HP-UX Itanium operating system to Linux and Windows software running on x86. The move comes at an uncertain time for Itanium. Oracle stopped developing new software for the platform in March, following similar moves by Microsoft, Ubuntu and Red Hat in the previous years. In HP's discussion of its fourth quarter of 2011 financial earnings the company picked out Itanium as the primary reason for a 23 percent year-over-year decline in revenues within its Business Critical Systems division.

2005-03-29 - HP drops eight-processor Xeon servers  Hewlett-Packard, the top seller of servers using x86 processors such as Intel's Xeon, has followed rival Dell with a decision to retreat from selling models using eight processors. Dell canceled an eight-processor Xeon server plan in 2003, a decision that dovetails with the company's position that powerful "big iron" servers are being replaced by clusters of lower-end machines. It took HP another generation of chips and crucial supporting components called chipsets to reach a similar decision--although for different reasons. HP believes that forthcoming Xeon chips that employ dual-processing engines, called cores, will be more popular than full-fledged eight-processor machines, said Colin Lacey, director of platform marketing for the company's industry standard server group. And for powerful machines, HP steers customers to higher-end servers with as dozens of Intel Itanium processors. "We are not refreshing our eight-socket platforms," Lacey said. "We have determined, based on the performance we anticipate delivering in the x86 space in 2005, that the position of the eight-way will be somewhat marginalized by these next-generation four-way platforms." HP's move makes sense, said Sageza Group analyst Clay Ryder. "Eight-way systems are a lot more complicated than single-way," he said. Beyond four-processor servers, "things become geometrically more complicated. When things become complicated, they become expensive." Business reasons provide further incentive for HP. "When you get to that level of Xeon performance, you're starting to have systems with Itanium there that becomes an internal conflict" between different HP business units. HP revealed its decision to skip eight-processor servers at the same time it announced two new four-Xeon servers Tuesday, as expected, and a new dual-processor system. Intel's latest Xeon processors, which bring 64-bit memory extensions to four-processor servers, include a lower-end model code-named Cranford and a higher-end model code named Potomac with more built-in cache memory. Intel and business partners plan to announce the chips at an event in San Francisco on Tuesday. Each new chip will be available in the new ProLiant ML570 G3 and DL580 G3 servers, Lacey said. Different views of x86 servers HP garnered $1.8 billion of the $6.1 billion in x86 server sales in 2004, and No. 2 Dell had $1.4 billion, according to market research firm Gartner. Dell and HP now rely on chipsets from Intel for all their Xeon models. But the two other major server sellers, IBM and Sun Microsystems, believe high-end x86 servers are worth pursuing. Big Blue has its own chipset, called X3 and code-named Hurricane, that permits as many as 32 Xeon processors to be used in a single server. And Sun has chosen a partnership with Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices that will result in the "Galaxy" server line with as many as eight AMD Opteron processors. IBM and Sun have a different view of the market, though. They each have their own high-end processor families to promote--IBM's Power and Sun's Sparc--while Dell and HP prefer to use Intel processors for high-end servers. Previously, HP created its own chipset, F8, for its eight-Xeon DL740 and DL760 servers. For lesser machines, it purchased chipsets from Intel and Broadcom's ServerWorks division. Now it's Intel only for x86 servers. "With this introduction, we do not have a new generation of ServerWorks chipsets shipping today," Lacey said. However, he added, "We continue to maintain open dialogue" with Broadcom. HP sells servers with four AMD Opteron processors but as with Xeon doesn't plan eight-processor models, Lacey added. "For eight-socket and above, we see the market space driven by our Integrity platforms," models employing Intel's Itanium, he said. Dell has announced its new four-processor models already, the PowerEdge 6800 and 6850. IBM also announced its four-processor x366 in February and put it on sale Tuesday. Sun discontinued its Xeon models and now sells only x86 servers using AMD's Opteron. Many other companies, including NEC, Penguin Computing, Unisys, Fujitsu and Acer also sell x86 servers. All the new servers employ Intel's E8500 chipset, which will accommodate future dual-core Xeon processors scheduled to arrive in 2006. New memory protection features HP's DL580 G3 is a rack-mounted model that measures four rack units--4U, or 7 inches--in height. It employs a technology called hot-plug RAID memory that permits administrators to change a faulty memory module in a running server without disrupting operations. It can accommodate as much as 32GB of memory; a bare-bones model costs $6,849. The ML570 G3 is similar but larger. It has 10 input-output slots to the DL580's seven, can accommodate 48GB of memory, and has more hard drive capacity. It's available as either a standalone model or a 6U (10.5-inch) rack-mount machine. Its starting price is $5,249. HP also began selling its dual-processor ML350 G4p, which uses the faster Xeon MP processor code-named Irwindale available with as much as 2MB of cache memory. That system has a starting price of $1,539. It doesn't employ hot-plug RAID memory but instead offers a less expensive alternative called online spare memory. With it, the machine can switch to a spare memory module if it detects that a primary one is faulty, but replacing the bad module requires that the server be shut down. Support for this technology, unlike the hot-plug RAID memory, requires operating system support, which is available in Windows Server 2003 today and is expected in Linux by the end of 2005, Lacey said. Four-Xeon blade servers also are under development at HP. "Don't have anything to announce at this time," Lacey said. "We will be coming back in a few weeks with some additional products to talk about there."
2004-05-05 - HP doubles up Itanium server processors    In June, Hewlett-Packard will begin shipping its mx2 technology, code-named Hondo, which lets two Itanium processors be plugged into a single socket, the company said Wednesday. Though Intel builds Itanium, HP helped develop its architecture and is the chip's biggest advocate. The mx2-enhanced Superdome server, with 128 Itanium 2 processors total, will be available in July, HP said. Models that today have four, eight, and 16 processors will be augmented with mx2 in June. HP had hoped to release mx2 in the first quarter of 2004.
2004-09-24 - HP discontinues its Itanium workstations   Hewlett-Packard, one of the most aggressive promoters of Intel's Itanium family of processors, is ditching its line of workstations that use the chips. The decision by the Palo Alto, Calif.-based computing giant will likely be interpreted as a large symbolic blow to Itanium's fortunes. HP co-designed the basic Itanium architecture with Intel and has committed to adopting the chip extensively in its high-end server line. HP is getting rid of its Itanium workstations, which use the Itanium 2 chip, because of the growing popularity of chips that can run 32-bit and 64-bit software similar to standard Windows and Linux code, such as the Opteron from Advanced Micro Devices and some of Intel's latest Xeon chips. Itanium requires software specially ported to the chip. "In working with and listening to our high-performance workstation partners and customers, we have become aware that the focus in this arena is being driven toward 64-bit extension technology," an HP spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail. "The decision to discontinue HP's Itanium workstation investment is limited to the workstation market and has no impact on HP's success with Itanium-based servers." Itanium 2 chips came in the zx2000 and zx6000 workstations. HP discontinued the workstations on Sept. 1 and will stop shipping new systems on Oct. 31. "The workstation market has never been the main focus for Itanium," an Intel representative said. "Itanium continues to make inroads in the high-end server market." Earlier this year, HP delivered a knock against Itanium's future, when it announced that it would start selling Opteron servers. The Itanium saga is one of the most closely watched dramas in the semiconductor world. HP and Intel began to collaborate on a server/workstation chip back in 1989. Because of Intel's manufacturing expertise and the processor know-how at the combined companies, many believed that the chip line would come to dominate the server market and even creep into desktops. Nearly every major server maker agreed to adopt the chip. Several delays, however, resulted in the first version of Itanium coming out in 2001. Performance was middling. New versions of the chip, dubbed Itanium 2, that emerged in 2002 and 2003 cured many of the performance problems. Indeed, Itanium 2 computers now regularly sit near the top of benchmark tests. Still, sales have not taken off, and some customers, such as IBM, have begun to emphasize other chips. Intel shipped just more than 100,000 Itanium 2s last year, and the company recently said it will not hit its goal of doubling that number this year. Analysts have regularly scaled back sales projections for the chip.
2001-12-04 - HP debuts super-skinny servers HP shows off super-slim serverMark Hudson, product manager, HP By piggybacking on an existing standard from telecommunications companies, Hewlett-Packard will beat its big-name competitors to the market with superthin "bladed" servers. The Palo Alto, Calif., company is taking orders for the systems code-named Powerbar, with volume shipments by early January. The company built the systems around the CompactPCI technology, an existing standard widely used in the telecommunications industry to pack numerous servers into as little space as possible. Bladed servers stack numerous independent lower-end servers within a single cabinet, vertically like books in a bookshelf or horizontally like plates in a cupboard. By comparison, most of today's low-end servers have only a single computer in one enclosure. The smallest common designs are shaped like pizza boxes, 1.75 inches thick and 19 inches wide, but stacking these by the dozen into racks results in a nightmarish profusion of cables sprouting from the backs of the systems. HP's blade systems combine within a single cabinet several types of blades--some for processing, some for storage and some for networking. A system with 16 processor blades and 16 storage and input-output blades costs about $45,000, said Brian Cox, entry-level server marketing manager, and Lin Nease, chief technologist for the Intel server line at HP. The initial systems will ship with Linux from Red Hat, SuSE and Debian, HP said. Windows support is planned for the first half of 2002, and support of other editions of Linux is planned for the second half. The HP systems expected to be announced Tuesday don't use the latest technology, but rather the older "Coppermine" Pentium III CPU and 440GX chipset to hook the CPU to memory and other subsystems. Future systems will be more sophisticated, with dual-processor models using the newer "Tualatin" line from Intel and systems using HP's PA-RISC chip coming by midyear. In 2003, servers with two servers on a single board are expected, Nease said. Also that year, the first blade servers using Intel's new high-end but power-hungry Itanium chips will arrive, Cox said. Top-tier competitors are eager to make their way into the market. Dell is working on thin blade designs as well as thicker "brick" systems. Compaq had expected its QuickBlade system by the end of this year. IBM was one of the first to start speaking about its bladed designs, code-named Excalibur. Intel is hoping to fuel the trend with ultra low-power CPUs. Chip designer Transmeta got an early start in the market with CPUs that consumed less electricity and thus presented less of an overheating problem. But many of the start-ups backing the company are struggling or expired. One problem: Transmeta servers don't support Error Correction Code (ECC), which cuts down on memory errors, or dual-processor configurations used in higher-powered systems. The "ultradense" server era began dawning earlier this year as companies sought a way to cram more processing power into less floor space to keep up with Internet demands, chiefly serving up Web pages to legions of Internet surfers. Research firm IDC expects blade servers will blossom in an otherwise grim server market. About 2 million blade servers will ship in 2005 with revenue of about $2.9 billion. While that's only about 10 percent of the market for servers costing less than $100,000, it's quick growth for a segment that IDC doesn't expect to really take off until 2003. Uses of HP's blade systems will begin with Web page serving and extend to running encrypted "virtual private network" (VPN) connections, authenticating access to networks, screening out intruders, and accelerating encrypted secure e-commerce transactions and e-mail. Blade servers are leading several trends in the industry. For one, they're encouraging server makers to produce better management software; it's impractical to manage hundreds of servers individually. And one of the promises of bladed servers is that whole gangs of servers could be switched quickly, even automatically, from one task to another as a company's workload demands shift. In addition, because numerous servers stack within one server seller's enclosure and run that company's management software, those selling the systems hope they'll be able to sell bladed servers in large doses. It's a union of low-end servers and high-end prices. Because of heat problems and limited space, bladed servers also mean tough engineering problems. Top-tier server makers relish these challenges as a way to separate them from "white-box" manufacturers that bolt together standard parts without needing much expertise. HP's designs, while requiring considerable skill, do capitalize on existing standards. Indeed, the company hopes its use of CompactPCI will encourage partnerships with other companies--HP blades in others' enclosures, or HP selling its blades in others' enclosures. "We want the help of the ecosystem," Cox said. One drawback of HP's CompactPCI design is that the 8-inch-by-10-inch blades and the 22.75-inch-tall enclosure are relatively large. Start-up RLX Technologies, by contrast, sells a 5.25-inch-tall system with 24 bladed servers and a 1.75-inch-tall system with six. A smaller, 10.5-inch-tall HP system is scheduled for release in the second half of 2002, the company said. CompactPCI isn't the only connection to the telecommunications realm in the HP models. The systems also are designed to comply with the Network Equipment Building Systems (NEBS) standard. NEBS-compliant servers can withstand earthquakes, high humidity, smoke and dust, and in the case of power outages can run on a direct current from giant battery systems instead of the usual alternating-current power supplies HP expects NEBS certification in the first half of 2002.
2002-03-13 - HP Compaq on Intel's role post-merger  Top R&D executives with Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer clarified on Wednesday the role chip giant Intel will play in their combined operation should the mega-merger between the companies succeed. HP, which has remained more independent than Compaq and Dell in following Intel's product roadmap, has no intention of handing over its server architecture to Intel in a post-merger world, said Dick Lampman, director of HP Labs. The companies will work together on projects, but HP will run its research and product-development projects separately. "Demands by our high-end customers will require a lot of innovation from the (merged) company," Lampman said. Lampman, along with Shane Robison, Compaq's chief technology officer, discussed the future of the combined companies research-and-development efforts in a conference call with the media. The press conference is yet another step the companies are waging in the hotly contested proxy battle over the $22 billion merger. HP shareholders vote on the merger Tuesday, with Compaq investors voting the following day. "We work closely with Intel on microprocessors for our server architecture, but we differentiate ourselves by our chipsets," Robison said. While microprocessors, or CPUs, serve as the brain of a computer, the chipset is like the spinal cord along which communications among the various components of the computer are passed. HP is also delving deeply into nanotechnology, which involves making circuits out of molecular chains. HP researchers have said nanotechnology could have commercial applications within a decade. Intel takes a dimmer view of its prospects. Chipsets aside, though, HP and Intel share a fairly strong bond. The two companies together devised the architecture behind Itanium, a 64-bit processor for high-end servers, and HP has said it will phase out its PA-RISC line of chips in favor of Itanium, over time. As a prelude to the merger, Compaq transferred the bulk of technology behind its Alpha chip line to Intel and switched to Itanium. Although it approved the merger, the Federal Trade Commission said that it had at one time had concerns about the merger's effect on the 64-bit chip market. Scott McNealy, Sun Microsystems chief executive, has avoided the Itanium chips and is a strong advocate of remaining independent when assembling an intellectual-property package. McNealy, in a previous interview with CNET's News.com, has described HP as a sellout and a "grocery store for Wintel computers." But Lampman and Robison said the merger will allow for more products and a faster introduction of those products to market. Both executives note, however, that it is difficult for the R&D departments to sum up whether they have achieved various goals. "It's not as easily quantifiable as sales figures," Robison said, adding that one metric used is information gleaned from partners. "Our partners let us know if we're helping our customers build out their product portfolios over the long term." Itanium is one of two major products that HP's research-and-development teams have embarked on recently. Lampman also pointed to HP's high-end Digital Press 6600, which uses liquid electrophotography--a technology that offers better resolution than laser or ink printers but claims a printing system that costs far less than traditional offset presses. "The interesting thing with this merger is what it will do for our customers," Robison said. "It will help them solve large problems that will enable them to move their infrastructure to the next generation."
2003-04-03 - HP chops Unix server prices    Hewlett-Packard has cut prices for its midrange Unix servers by about 20 percent, in an attempt to thwart renewed competition from rivals Sun Microsystems and IBM. The price cuts, which HP intends to announce Thursday, apply to the eight-processor rp4705 and rp7410 systems, and to the 16-processor rp8400, said Dimitris Dovas, an HP manager for midrange servers. At the same time, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company has expanded its capacity-on-demand system, which should improve how computers respond to abruptly increasing workloads and make it possible for buyers to better customize their systems. HP leads the market for Unix servers that cost between $100,000 and $1 million, according to researcher IDC, garnering $3 billion in revenue in 2002. The No. 2 seller, IBM, took in $2 billion, and third-place Sun racked up $1.6 billion. HP has kept the No. 1 spot in the midrange market for six years, according to Jean Bozman, a research vice president at IDC. But as a result of curtailed corporate spending and rising pressure from Intel servers, Unix server makers are slashing prices to be more competitive. Sun cut its Unix server prices in February, and IBM did so in January. "HP is seeing very tough competition from both Sun and IBM for Unix market share," said Technology Business Research analyst Bob Sutherland. Some of its competitive moves are likely geared to keeping customers who have purchased Compaq's AlphaServer Unix systems (a product line HP acquired in 2002) from fleeing to other server makers, he said. "HP is...suffering from a drop-off of Alpha sales and is seeking to try to shift a lot of those customers over, most likely leading with price, options and flexibility," Sutherland said. The company's price cuts were effective April 1 in North America and Europe, and will happen in the Asia-Pacific region April 7, Dovas said. The cuts were made because HP dropped processor prices 5 percent to 25 percent and memory 20 percent to 25 percent, he said. The changes pave the way for higher-end server systems coming later this year. HP's Unix servers today use PA-RISC 8700 processors, but upgrades this year will let customers install the PA-RISC 8800 "Mako" successor, a chip that has two 8700 processor cores etched into the same piece of silicon. That move will effectively let a customer convert an eight-processor system into a 16-processor machine, for example. It follows a similar step that IBM already took with its Power4 chip, that Sun is taking this year with the UltraSparc IV, and that Intel will take in 2005 with an Itanium-family chip code-named Montecito. HP's 8800 chip, "Mako," will debut in the top-end Superdome system, which accommodates as many as 64 8700 chips, but will effectively become a 128-processor system with the dual-core 8800 chips. Program switch In another move designed to ease customers' wallets, HP expanded its capacity-on-demand program. Until now, customers could switch on installed but unused processors, paying list price for the processors only when they went into use. Under the expansion, customers will be able to switch on entire "cell" boards, which include four processors and accompanying memory, Dovas said. The program addresses a situation in which a customer might switch on a new processor but not have sufficient memory to take advantage of it. Buyers don't have to pay a premium for the extra capacity, Dovas said. About 50 percent of Superdome customers buy servers with the capacity-on-demand option, Dovas said. For midrange systems, about 20 percent to 25 percent do so. For low-end systems, only 5 percent or 8 percent do, he said. In addition, HP has introduced changes to make its supply and manufacturing chain more efficient and is now promising to deliver customized configurations of midrange servers to customers within five days of placing an order, Dovas said. In the past, customers could get certain standard configurations within that turnaround, but not customized features such as the installation of specific software. HP hopes buyers will find the option more appealing on the basis that they'll be able to save money by getting new systems up and running sooner, Dovas said.
2004-02-09 - HP brings new chips to servers Hewlett-Packard announced on Monday new servers that use Intel's Itanium processor and HP's own PA-8800, the second-to-last chip in the company's Precision Architecture lineage. As reported, the announcement includes new low-end Itanium-based models and high-end PA-8800-based models. Almost all of the PA-8800 based systems are available now, and the top-end 128-processor Superdome will ship in March, HP said. Although HP is moving its high-end line to Itanium, most customers of its Unix servers still use PA-RISC based models. The new PA-8800 chip, a "dual-core" model that packs two PA-8700 chips onto a single slice of silicon, boosts performance as much as 150 percent compared with the PA-8700, HP said. The Itanium systems include the rx2600, updated with new lower-priced processors and shipping now, and the rx1600, a slim 1.75-inch-thick model expected to ship in March. The models are arriving during a fiercely competitive time in the server market, just now returning to growth after years of punishing discounts. At the same time HP's new servers are emerging, Sun Microsystems also is launching new UltraSparc IV-based servers Tuesday, while IBM is slated to release its new Power5-based "Squadron" systems later in the year. HP is gradually phasing out the PA chips at the heart of its Unix server line in favor of Itanium. In addition, HP also is phasing out the Alpha chips used in the AlphaServer line and the MIPS chips at the heart of its NonStop line, both acquired as a result of the 2002 merger with Compaq Computer. At the same time it's reducing this complexity, it's also expanding its ProLiant line, powered by Intel's 32-bit Xeon processors today and, according to sources, Advanced Micro Devices' 64-bit Opteron processor in the future. While HP calls the new chips a natural extension to the 32-bit x86 lineage, industry analysts see the chips as blurring the previously clear distinction between the x86 chips and the 64-bit Itanium. Intel is working on its own 64-bit x86 extensions, formerly called Yamhill but now code-named Clackamas Technology, or CT, according to sources. Because the PA-8800 is a dual-core chip, it permits two processors to be fit into a single chip socket; HP counts each PA-8800 as two processors. That terminology agrees with IBM's approach with its existing dual-core Power4 and forthcoming Power5 processors. Sun, however, calls its dual-core UltraSparc IV a single processor, preferring to emphasize that its chip can simultaneously execute two instruction sequences, called threads. The 128-processor Superdome--using as many as 64 PA-8800 chips--will be available for a starting price of $309,000 in March, HP said. Available today are five new PA-8800-based Unix servers: The 32-processor rp8420 has a starting cost of $93,000 with PA-8800 processors and 2GB of memory. The 16-processor rp7420 has a starting cost of $40,000 with two PA-8800 processors and 2GB of memory. The 8-processor rp4440 has a starting cost of $21,000 with twoPA-8800 processors and 1GB of memory. The 4-processor rp3440 has a starting cost of $7,000 with two PA-8800 processors and 1GB of memory. The 2-processor rp3410 has a starting cost of $4,000 with two PA-8800 processors and 1GB of memory. In other news... Also on Monday, HP announced new pricing options for its midrange storage line. The company introduced a pay-per-use financing option that lets customers pay for storage capacity as they need it. Hewlett-Packard also said Monday that it will launch its biggest ad campaign to date targeted at large businesses. With the new ads, which kick off next month, HP is trying to convince companies both that change is a good thing and that HP is the right computer maker to help businesses navigate that change. The television, online and outdoor ads feature case studies of how HP has helped various large customers, including Kimberly-Clark, the U.S. Postal Service and the Screen Actors Guild. The campaign is the latest twist to the company's ongoing "+HP" effort, which kicked off in November 2002. "We asked hundreds of CIOs and IT executives what keeps them awake at night. The universal response was 'change,'" said a statement from Allison Johnson, senior vice president at HP. "With this campaign, we hope to help companies see the benefits of embracing change." HP said it will start the campaign in the United States next month, expanding to 17 other countries in April. CNET News.com's Ina Fried contributed to this report.
2002-06-10 - HP boosts Unix for Itanium Hewlett-Packard is pressing its Unix advantage for Intel's Itanium 2, announcing advanced supporting software Monday. The HP-UX 11i version 1.6, available in the third week of July, will bring HP's Itanium version of Unix closer to parity with the version that long has run on its proprietary PA-RISC processors. HP, the co-inventor of the Itanium chips, is moving its server line over the course of years from PA-RISC to the Itanium family. HP-UX once was one of many Itanium operating system contenders, including at least five versions of Unix, but now that list has been whittled down chiefly to Linux, Windows and HP-UX. That winnowing leaves HP with a strong advantage--assuming the Itanium lives up to its potential to grow into real competition to high-end 64-bit chips from IBM, SGI and Sun Microsystems. IBM decided against selling or supporting AIX 5L for Itanium, a product that was the result of a years-long collaboration project code-named Monterey. Sun's Solaris was the victim of squabbling between Intel and Sun. SGI decided to keep to support only Linux, not its Irix, for Itanium computers. As a result of HP's acquisition of Compaq Computer, its Tru64 Unix is being phased out over a period of years, and its features are being folded into HP-UX. Intel's Itanium 2, the second generation of Intel's new 64-bit processor line, is due out this summer. Along with it are coming a bevy of crucial components called chipsets that will enable everything from two-processor to 32-processor servers. The difference between HP-UX 11i version 1.5 and 1.6 is like the difference between the first and second Itaniums. The earlier version "was more or less a tire-kicking, early adopter" version, said Ram Appalaraju, director of marketing for HP-UX. HP-UX is included with the price of its Unix servers, but because several different operating systems may be purchased on Itanium systems, HP is charging for the new version. The price is $2,995 per processor, except on single- or dual-processor systems, in which case it's free, Appalaraju said. With 1.6, HP adds many new features designed for real-world use of the systems: The ability to run programs written for PA-RISC chips without any changes through translation software called Aries. The translation software is slower but ensures easier software shifts. Software for allocating which computing tasks are allowed to use which computing resources. The ability to detect and shut down misbehaving processors and memory. PA-RISC servers can automatically fire up unused spares in this situation, but that feature won't make it to Itanium systems until mid-2003, Appalaraju said. MC Serviceguard "clustering" software, which allows jobs to run on a group of servers and lets one take over when another fails. The clustering software will support as many as 16 servers in the cluster. Support for BEA Systems' application server, a popular software package for e-commerce Web sites. Support for 26 different adjustments that can be made to the heart of the HP-UX operating system without having to shut down the machine when making those changes. Studies of thousands of HP customers show that tweaking those 26 adjustments, done to optimize the server for different types of computing jobs, is responsible for 75 percent of voluntary reboots. Appalaraju also described several future plans for HP-UX. About a year from now, the first version for both Itanium and PA-RISC will debut, along with the ability to run on servers with as many as 128 processors--a necessary step for future top-end Superdome servers. That version is called 11i version 2. In that same time frame, HP will release test versions of software to let Linux software for Itanium servers run unchanged on HP-UX Itanium servers, Appalaraju said. In mid-2004, HP-UX will acquire high-end clustering features from Tru64 Unix, which analysts praise for having the most sophisticated features for making business software run across a group of servers as if it were a single machine. That version is 11i version 2T. About 18 months later--some time in 2005--11i version 3 will arrive, and will include increasing abilities to adjust itself automatically to changing jobs and repairing problems automatically.
2002-07-25 - HP board forms tech policy committee   Hewlett-Packard's board of directors has formed a technology committee to study such key issues as the company's transition to Itanium processors. The committee will oversee some of HP's most pressing technology issues, which includes greater use of direct sales and ensuring its research work is firmly aligned with corporate strategy, a source close to the company said. The committee was formed less than three months after the completion of HP's $19 billion merger with Compaq and held its first meeting last week. "The technology committee will help the board look at the enablers for the merger," said the source. HP four board members appointed to the technology committee are George Keyworth II and former HP executive Dick Hackborn, both whom were HP directors before the merger, and Tom Perkins and Lawrence Babbio Jr., former Compaq directors pre-merger. Perkins, co-founder of venture firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, suggested the creation of a technology committee and received strong support from Carly Fiorina, HP chief executive, the source said. While such committees are somewhat unusual among large, established companies, Perkin's proposal is less surprising when considering his venture capitalist background. An HP representative declined to comment on the committee. "It's unusual for a large company board to create a technology committee, but it's common among start-ups that are financed by venture capitalists," said Margaret Blair, a corporate governance expert and Sloan Project visiting professor at Georgetown University. "Start-ups will often create a board that includes members from the company, their venture capitalists and several people from the industry to provide technical knowledge and be real advisors to management." Blair, author of "Ownership and Control: Rethinking Corporate Governance for the Twenty-First Century," also noted Fiorina's support for the technology committee may represent a smart move. "In a way, it's a very smart and gutsy move by Carly Fiorina. It's a way to say, 'come on and take a look at what is going on.' It's a way of signaling, 'I'm not worried about any skeletons in the closet,' " Blair said, adding, "And even though there were board members who supported her in the merger, it was a bruising battle with (former dissident HP director) Walter Hewlett." Hewlett, son of HP co-founder William Hewlett, took HP's management and fellow directors by surprise when he launched a proxy battle to oppose the mega merger with Compaq. One subject the technology committee will scrutinize is HP's bet on Itanium, the high-end Intel processor that's the foundation for HP's entire high-end computer future and central to fending off competition from IBM, Sun Microsystems and Dell Computer. HP is betting the chip will simplify hardware and software engineering efforts while lowering processor research expenses and just unveiled its first serious Itanium systems. Eventually, Itanium will replace HP's PA-RISC chip in high-end servers and workstations. "The technology committee will receive input from the board as it reviews the complexity and evolution of moving HP to an Itanium architecture. Some of the issues include how fast should the transition move and some of the technological hurdles," said the source, adding it isn't known how long it will take for Itanium servers to outpace those with HP's PA-RISC and 32-bit Intel chips such as Xeon or Pentium. Software written for Intel's 32-bit processors must be drastically overhauled to work well on Itanium, a major hurdle in moving to the processor. HP developed the idea behind Itanium before entering into a 1993 partnership under which Intel handles most of the work of designing and building it. HP's work has given the company a financial edge over competitors besides just the extra years of design experience, the source said. HP gets a deeper discount on Itanium processors than HP competitors, the sourse said. Because Intel doesn't pay HP Itanium royalties, that discount helps to offset some of the billions of research dollars that HP spent on Itanium, the source said. Intel declined to comment on pricing differences among various customers. As HP looks to manage its research and development operations, the committee also will review whether the division's plans are aligned with the company's strategic goals, the source said.

2005-01-17 - HP augments Itanium server line    Hewlett-Packard on Monday announced a suite of improvements to its Itanium-based Integrity line of servers, including new chips, support for a fourth operating system and new options for running multiple jobs on the same machine. HP announced the changes Monday, but Chief Executive Carly Fiorina and other executives will detail them during a Webcast on Tuesday. Itanium arrived slower than co-inventors HP and Intel wanted, but the computer and printer maker is asserting its new server lines are catching on. Itanium-related sales topped $1 billion in 2004, and HP's Itanium server shipments will match those based on its PA-RISC processor by the end of the year, HP said. As previously reported, higher-end Integrity servers are available. They can include Intel's newest top-line Itanium processor with 9MB of high-speed cache memory, as well as version 8.2 of HP's venerable OpenVMS operating system, which can now run on Itanium. OpenVMS joins three other operating systems already available on the Integrity line: Microsoft Windows, Linux from Red Hat and Novell, and HP's version of Unix, called HP-UX. Combinations of these four operating systems can be run on the same server through the use of technology called partitioning. Some of those other operating systems also have gotten a boost. HP supports a pay-per-use program for Windows, letting customers pay on the basis of how much computing power a Windows partition uses. That can be substantially less expensive than buying on the basis of a server's total capacity. In addition, through the use of SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 from Novell, Linux now can run on 16-processor Integrity servers instead of just eight-processor models, HP said. The improvement came through use of the 2.6 Linux kernel, which is scheduled for use in Red Hat Enterprise Linux in the first quarter of 2005. A fifth operating system, NonStop, will arrive in mid-2005, HP said. It's used in very high-end specialty servers that require somewhat different hardware than the Integrity line, however. HP has a collection of software called the Virtual Server Environment to improve how a single server juggles multiple jobs. The company announced its Process Resource Manager 3.0, which automates allocation of resources such as memory, processor power and network bandwidth for HP-UX. HP also announced version 3 of its HP-UX Workload Manager for automatically juggling priorities on one system and its Global Workload Manager doing the same across multiple servers running either HP-UX or Linux. The faster processor boosts performance as much as 25 percent. New Integrity models with the chip include the dual-processor rx1620-2 starting at $4,119; the dual-processor rx2620-2 starting at $5,614; the four-processor rx4640-8 starting at $16,600; the eight-processor Integrity rx7620-16 starting at $18,995; the 16-processor rx8620-32 starting at $57,990; and the 64-processor Superdome starting at $185,252. The systems also can accommodate doubled processor counts through the use of the mx2 technology.
2003-02-18 - HP adds muscle to Itanium servers  Hewlett-Packard on Tuesday will announce two server components that will vastly increase the power of the company's Itanium servers, making them on par with the machines using processors of the company's own design. HP will announce at the Intel Developer Forum the sx1000 chipset, which will let HP build machines with eight to 64 Itanium processors. It also will announce a packaging technology called mx2 that will let the company plug two Itaniums into a single socket, giving a powerful upgrade option and enabling mammoth machines with as many as 128 processors. The sx1000, code-named Pinnacles, will begin shipping in servers in mid-2003, said Jean-Jacque Ozil, director of the Itanium program for HP's Business Critical Systems Group. The mx2 technology, code-named Hondo, is due in the first quarter of 2004, he said. The products show that HP, while reliant on Intel for the Itanium processor itself, is able to control much of the rest of its high-end computing destiny. While HP plans to phase out its own PA-RISC processor line two generations from now, the company's two main rivals--IBM and Sun Microsystems--have their own high-end processor lines and therefore have been insulated against the problems Itanium has had getting to market. "Certainly HP has a great dependency on Intel for Itanium processor family delivery. They're probably pretty smart not to create yet more dependences," said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. At a keynote address Thursday in San Jose, Calif., Scott Stallard, head of HP's Business Critical Server Group, and Mike Fister, senior vice president of Intel's Enterprise Platforms Group, will demonstrate a server with the sx1000 chipset simultaneously running Windows, Linux and HP's version of Unix, called HP-UX, HP said. Faced with Itanium's sluggish emergence, HP extended its PA-RISC lifespan several generations. The second-to-last model, called PA-8800 and code-named Mako, will arrive in servers shipping in the first quarter of 2004, Ozil said. Chipsets--the chips that join processors to each other, to memory and to input-output systems--essentially are the spinal cord of a computer. They're secondary in importance only to the central processors themselves in a computer design. The sx1000 chipset will let HP build servers with 64 sockets that accommodate either Itanium or PA-RISC chips. HP's technology, though, will let the systems actually house 128 processors. The PA-8800 is a "dual-core" design that includes two processors on a single slice of silicon. With Itaniums, the mx2 packaging provides the way to let two chips share one socket. HP's servers can be subdivided into many independent machines, each with its own operating system. Itanium versions of Windows, Linux, HP-UX and HP's venerable OpenVMS will be able to run simultaneously in different partitions, Ozil said. The smallest system HP will build around the sx1000 will be an eight-socket successor to HP's current rp7400 system due midyear, said Mark Woods, the product manager for the sx1000 and mx2. The sx1000-based Superdome successor is due in the latter half of 2003 along with the third-generation "Madison" version of Itanium. (In computer planning circles, "midyear" can extend to as late as the end of September.) Uncertain future HP came up with the idea behind Itanium in the 1988 and in the 1990s signed a partnership under which Intel was to build and help design the chip family. The Intel partnership was designed so the Itanium family would be widely used, attracting widespread support from software companies and computer makers and not being consigned to the high-end boutique niche that HP's own PA-RISC chip family occupy. The Itanium family has had a hard time making its way into the world. Early models were delayed several times, and its adoption has been slowed by the fact that the overall Itanium design forces software companies to profoundly rework products that had been tailored for Intel's Pentium and Xeon processors. But things are looking up as the hardware and software support gradually grows up. The second-generation Itanium 2 model, code-named McKinley, showed strong performance and last week was lauded as the best server processor by influential chip-watchers at the Microprocessor Report. It's still not clear, though, whether Itanium will achieve its promise as a widely used processor. Two loud backers in the server community, Compaq Computer and HP, have merged. Sun, the top Unix server company, parted ways with Intel over Itanium and plugs its own UltraSparc chip line. Unisys, NEC, SGI, Fujitsu and IBM all plan high-end Itanium servers, but the first four of those don't occupy the first rank among server makers, and IBM's grander plans are built around its Power5 processor and its sequels. In a sign of its priorities, IBM recently transferred a handful of programmers working on Linux for Itanium to work on Linux for Power, spokesman Ron Favali said. In the effort to build Itanium servers, "HP is leading, but they're sort of in a race by themselves," Haff said. And while there have been troubles getting Itanium to market, Intel is a powerful ally with deep manufacturing expertise. Many expect Intel to be one of the chip manufacturers that won't be squeezed out of the market as chip building becomes ever more complicated and expensive. Intel's track record hasn't been as good when it comes to chipsets, though, and HP was wise not to hand that element of computer design off as well, Haff said. "They (HP) basically are doing all their own chipsets. They're not dependent on Intel to deliver chipsets, which is a real smart move on HP's part," Haff said. Intel has had a spotty record delivering chipsets and most Intel servers today use chipsets from Broadcom subsidiary ServerWorks. And Intel's latest high-end chipset, the Profusion product that permitted the first mainstream eight-processor Intel servers was late to market. The mx2 packaging will include two Itanium 2 processors and 32MB of high-speed cache memory that compensates for the fact that two chips must share the same connections to the rest of the server. It will be available as an upgrade to existing servers, HP said. However, the mx2 technology has some tradeoffs. To make sure the two-chip package doesn't consume more power than a single chip, HP will include technology that can throttle the chip speeds down so they don't consume as much electricity or produce as much waste heat. And its possible HP will use Itanium processors with smaller amounts of onboard cache, said Haff, noting that the mx2's own cache could counterbalance that weakness. Even with the strong push toward Itanium, Ozil predicted HP Itanium servers would outship PA-RISC servers in 2005. Haff was more guarded. "I would think it would be at least that long," he said. "These things take a long time to happen."

2001-10-31 - How Intel plans to survive the downturn    The semiconductor market is stuck in one of its worst slumps, Intel CEO Craig Barrett says, but the growth of the Internet just might be its savior. The apparent paradox--declining industry revenues during a period of increasing customer use--was the central theme in Intel's biannual financial Webcast on Tuesday. Barrett and other executives said that all of the markets in which the company participates struggled this year. "For those of us who've been in the business for 30 years, this is the biggest slowdown that our industry has ever seen. This is twice the slowdown that we saw in 1995," Barrett said. "The Internet is just starting its early stages of buildout...The massive volume of traffic is just beginning." To capitalize on that rebound, Intel is tweaking its overall strategy to better target growth areas. The company, unlike in recent years, will now almost exclusively focus on its core chip markets. Intel will place increasing emphasis on emerging PC markets, such as China and India. This strategy will require a renewed focus on costs, the company said. "It requires us to be very scrupulous about costs," said Paul Otellini, executive vice president and general manager of the Intel Architecture Group. "In Latin America, parts of Eastern Europe and Russia, we are seeing growth in excess of 100 percent." Intel will also increase contacts with dealers and regional manufacturers--the main conduits for technology in these regions, Otellini said. In established markets, the company will work on "influencing the upgrade cycle," Otellini said, by working with software developers to come up with more glamorous applications that, in turn, require faster processors to run effectively. Server strategy will follow a different approach. Intel plans to come out with a host of Xeon and Itanium processors in 2002 for servers that will compete against products from Sun Microsystems. In addition, Intel will devise "solution blueprints" with partners that will take some of the pain out of installing complex back-end systems. One blueprint, for example, combines Compaq Computer hardware, software from a number of companies, and consulting how-to from Ernst & Young. "We're creating the shrink-wrap equivalent for the e-business conversion," Otellini said. "We are absolutely, deadly focused on increasing our market share." In cell phones and mobile devices, Intel will work with software developers and carriers to better incorporate its chips with upcoming 2.5G and 3G services. The more advanced wireless networks will help the company, as consumers will need to upgrade their current handsets to accommodate the technology, according to Ron Smith, general manager of Intel's Wireless Communications and Computing Group. "The installed base is aging, and data will be coming that will force an upgrade cycle. The DoCoMo iMode service has 26 million subscribers, and Japan is not an isolated test case," Smith said. Intel also plans to push through an integrated cell phone chip that will combine a digital signal processor, a microprocessor and flash memory, he added. Company executives detailed a number of product plans during the call: For desktops, the Pentium 4 processor will hit 3GHz in 2002. In addition, a chipset with integrated graphics for low-priced Pentium 4 computers will debut in the second quarter. By mid-2002, the first Celerons using the NetBurst architecture, the underlying architecture of the Pentium 4, will be released. Celerons now are based on the older Pentium III architecture. Prestonia, a dual-processor Xeon chip for servers based on the Pentium 4 architecture, comes out in the first quarter. Gallatin, a multiprocessor Xeon for servers, will be unveiled in the fourth quarter. Commercial systems containing McKinley, the next version of Itanium, will come out mid-2002. Pilot production on McKinley will begin this quarter. In the first quarter of 2002, consumers can expect the first Pentium 4 for mobile computers. Meanwhile, in 2003, Intel will release Banias, a processor specifically designed for notebooks. The chip will perform 25 percent better than other Intel chips at that time, Otellini said, and will provide 25 percent better battery life. By the end of 2002, six factories will be manufacturing chips on the more advanced 0.13-micron manufacturing process, and two of these factories will process 300-millimeter-diameter wafers. Shifting to the 0.13-micron process will boost speeds and lower costs, while 300-millimeter wafers will lower costs.
2005-11-01 - Higher-end dual-core Xeons servers arrive  Intel launched its dual-core Xeon processor for higher-end servers on Tuesday, and its top server allies--IBM, Dell and Hewlett-Packard--all announced new four-processor servers using the chip. The new chips have two processing engines, called cores, on a single slice of silicon, making each chip work somewhat like two single Xeon processors. The move helps Intel catch up to rival Advanced Micro Devices--which in April introduced its dual-core Opteron--in a significant domain. The chip announced Tuesday, code-named Paxville, is for servers with four processor-sockets. To reduce AMD's advantage, Intel had already released a version for two-socket servers in October. The company has been hustling; it released Paxville five months earlier than planned, Kirk Skaugen, general manager of Intel's Server Platforms Group, said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday. "Intel is working very hard to make this dual-core turn, and doing a surprisingly good job at it," said Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice. However, it's having a harder time with the Itanium side of its server chip work: Intel has delayed its dual-core "Montecito" model until mid-2006. Paxville products introduce a new Intel hardware feature called Virtualization Technology (VT), code-named Vanderpool, which simplifies running multiple operating systems on the same server. The feature improves the performance and flexibility of software such as VMware's ESX Server or Xen. However, support for VT won't be enabled until software is more mature, Skaugen said. Then computer users could activate the feature through a hardware configuration process. "We're working with the industry to turn this capability on--once the software is ready--via a BIOS switch in the early 2006 time frame," he said. For dual-processor servers, VT support will arrive with the Dempsey dual-core processor due in the first quarter of 2006. AMD plans to introduce its equivalent technology, code-named Pacifica, in the first half of 2006. Early models will come with a connection to the rest of the system, called the front-side bus, which runs at 667MHz. In the first quarter of 2006, the systems will be upgraded with models using an 800MHz front-side bus, the biggest benefit of which is faster memory access. Intel introduced a new numbering scheme with the Paxville line, calling them the 7000 series, and the pricing and model numbers match those reported by CNET News.com in October. The 3GHz 7040 and 7041, with dual 2MB caches and 667MHz and 800MHz front-side buses respectively, cost $3,157 in quantities of 1,000. The 2.66GHz 7020, with dual 1MB caches and a 667MHz bus, costs $1,177. The 2.8GHz 7030, with dual 1MB caches and an 800MHz bus, costs $1,980. Intel is working on new members of the Xeon MP family for multiprocessor servers. Next in line is "Tulsa," which would come with 16MB of high-speed cache memory, Skaugen said. Tulsa would be built using a manufacturing process with circuitry features that measure 65 nanometers, significantly smaller than the 90-nanometer features of Paxville. (A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.) Tulsa will fit into the existing Truland server platform used by Paxville and its single-core predecessors, Potomac and Cranford, introduced earlier in 2005. Last week, Intel announced a change to its post-Tulsa plans. It had planned to release the "Whitefield" chip, but has replaced it with "Tigerton." The key difference between the two chips is how each communicates with the rest of the system: Tigerton's interconnect will "more than double" how much data can be transferred to and from the chip in a given amount of time, in comparison to Xeon servers with the Truland platform, Skaugen said. Also, the new interconnect will be faster than what had been planned with Whitefield, Skaugen said. He refused to say how much faster. Among the servers introduced Tuesday using the new chip: IBM is using the processors in its x460, which has a starting price of $20,999. The x460 accommodates as many as 32 Xeon processors when eight chassis are linked together. Intel's new dual-core Xeon processor will also go into IBM's four-processor x366, whose starting price is $9,999. HP plans to release two Paxville MP models next week, spokesman Eric Kreuger said: the ProLiant DL580 G3 and the ML570 G3. Both use a 667MHz front-side bus, but an upgrade in the first quarter of 2006 will offer a 800MHz bus. Dell released the Xeon as a new option for its free-standing PowerEdge 6800 and rack-mounted 6850 servers. The systems have a starting cost of about $6,800, Dell said.
2004-05-26 - High-end servers to stave off low-end attack   NEW YORK--Low-end servers linked tightly together will encroach on the turf of massive multiprocessor machines but won't replace them, server experts predicted on Wednesday. More powerful networks and better database software have made groups of low-end servers better able to share a single database, but the technology still is immature, panelists speaking at the CeBit America trade show here said. "The challenge there is really management. It's easier to manage a single operating system image than to manage a cluster of smaller nodes," said Jay Bretzmann, the manager of product marketing for IBM's Intel-based xSeries servers. John Miller, the director of server marketing for Hewlett-Packard's Business-Critical Systems Organization, agreed, saying most customers with clustered databases are just dipping their toes in the technology with two-node groups. "I think that the technology needs to evolve more...I don't think, if you look at the broader context, you're going to see a mass exodus from scale-up computing," Miller said, referring to the use of massive single systems. There are some areas where the "scale out" approach--with numerous small systems--beats the "scale up" approach hands down, for tasks such as sending out streams of videos and hosting online games, for example, Bretzmann said. But in terms of money spent, larger multiprocessor systems still dominate, said Mark Melenovsky, an analyst with research firm IDC. "While scale-out has gotten a lot of attention, more than half of spending is still on four-way or greater platforms," he said. Oracle and Dell are loud advocates of clustered databases, with HP and IBM giving more qualified support. The 64-bit question Panelists also ventured other predictions about the future of servers at the show. One debate likely to fade quickly is about the need for 64-bit processors, which can gracefully accommodate more than 4GB of memory, Bretzmann predicted. "I don't think we'll discuss this after 2004, because 64-bit computing will be ubiquitous," he said. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices led the charge to 64-bit enhancements to the previously 32-bit "x86" chips, and Intel plans to follow suit by releasing its equivalent, the first Xeon model, in coming weeks. Intel also supports a separate, higher-end family of 64-bit chips--Itanium--which was codeveloped with HP but which has so far not been widely used. Intel has said that Itanium and Xeon systems will cost the same by 2007, through the use of common hardware designs. However, HP's Miller was more cautious. "Quite frankly, I think that's a little soon. But it does show what Intel's belief is," Miller said. IDC in January lowered forecasts for sales of Itanium-based servers as a result of the arrival of 64-bit x86 chips. Exercising utility The CeBit America panelists also tackled the idea of utility computing--a concept also touted under the adaptive, on-demand, organic and dynamic computing labels. It aims to cut management costs by enabling businesses to pool servers and other technology into a fluid computing resource, so that the cost of running the system matches the computing load it handles. IBM, HP and Sun Microsystems are moving as fast as they can to build utility computing technology, which tends to be enormously complicated. But other providers may not be keeping up. "I do think Microsoft is behind," Miller said, adding that the software maker "can evolve and shouldn't be taken for granted." And Microsoft will begin to make more headway with the release of its Virtual Server 2005 product, which lets several operating systems be run on a single server through a technology called virtualization, Bretzmann said. That technology, which already exists on Unix servers, on mainframes, and on Intel-based servers using EMC's VMware software, is a key step for building a fluid computing environment. "The problem they had is a support issue. If somebody was running virtualization and had a problem, the first thing Microsoft would tell you is, 'Take that virtualization away,'" Bretzmann said. Microsoft's response to the competition will arise out of its expansion of its software lines beyond its Windows products, Melenovsky said. "A lot of the profit pool associated with the core operating system is draining and bleeding away into more advanced feature such as workload management and virtualization. It's certainly a strategic direction for Microsoft," Melenovsky said.
2008-02-29 - High time for Intel to get serious about graphics  When a high-ranking executive at your strongest partner openly thinks your technology "barely works," perhaps it's time to make that a higher priority. A series of internal Microsoft e-mails discussing Intel's 915 and 945 integrated graphics chipsets in unfavorable terms made its salacious way around the Internet this week. Microsoft is currently being sued over its Windows Vista upgrade programs, which were designed with pressure from Intel, but over the objections of the PC industry, to include support for a graphics chipset that couldn't run Vista's Aero interface. In February 2007, just after Vista launched, Microsoft's Steve Sinofsky told CEO Steve Ballmer that the 945 chipset, required for the "Vista Premium Ready" logo, could barely run Vista. And everyone (inside the PC industry, at least) knew the widely used 915 chipset that was awarded the "Vista Capable" logo couldn't even think about running the advanced display driver model used to deliver the fancy Aero interface, considered one of the major selling points of Vista. Juicy stuff, for sure, but it's old news that Intel and Microsoft have been in engaged in "coopetition" for years. The real lesson is just how badly even Microsoft thinks of the current state of integrated graphics. Intel likes to mention that it's the world's leading supplier of graphics technology. The only reason it can claim that mantle, however, is because people like bargains, and the way they get those bargains is through the use of integrated graphics chipsets. Around 75 percent of the notebooks, and around 60 percent of the desktops, sold last year used integrated graphics chips. The rest use discrete graphics chips made by Nvidia and AMD that offer far more powerful performance for games and video. The integrated graphics chips, usually thought of as "good-enough graphics," really aren't that good. Intel has had loads of problems with its graphics chipsets and their support for PC games or other intense graphical programs. Most of that software will run, but not in an ideal fashion, and lots of people expect that shiny new PC to be able to run PC games without fits and starts or jerky gameplay. Intel has put the 915 and 945 chipsets behind it, but challenges remain. It still encountered problems with the release of the 965 chipset, and the G30 series has yet to make it into notebook PCs. This area represents arguably Intel's most glaring weakness at present. The company has shown it's getting more serious about graphics, hiring more engineers and focusing some of its design prowess on projects like Larrabee. And it tried to take a big step forward in the performance of its 965-series integrated graphics chipsets by adding support for functions like transform and lighting. It had lots of problems delivering drivers for that chipset, however, and when those drivers arrived, they didn't deliver a uniform boost in performance. Nvidia and AMD are way ahead when it comes to understanding how to build graphics chips. Nvidia has been doing this for years, and AMD recognized the growing importance of graphics when it acquired (for far more than it should have paid, however) ATI Technologies in 2006. Graphics chips and CPUs like the Core 2 Duo are two very different beasts, but the wholesale embrace of multicore processor designs means that at some point, graphics technology becomes just a core on the main chip. AMD is well underway with planning for its Fusion processor and Nvidia seems to be eyeing broader uses for its high-powered graphics chips. This is Intel's next great challenge, now that it has thankfully derailed the March of Itanium and soothed the burns from the Netburst architecture. It needs to somehow get up to speed with Nvidia and the former ATI when it comes to graphics knowledge while keeping an eye on the rest of its business. Intel has found it difficult in recent years to break into new areas, such as flat-screen TVs or cell phones, that have very different processing requirements and architectures than the CPU. But those other bets were just that, bets. This time, Intel has no choice. Intel can't afford to fall behind as the PC industry changes; it's one thing to swing and miss when trying something new, it's quite another to miss the mark on your home turf. By the time Windows 7 rolls around, Intel will need to do better than "barely works."
2011-06-16 - Hewlett-Packard sues Oracle over Itanium support   Making good on a threat issued in a letter last week , Hewlett-Packard has filed a lawsuit against software giant Oracle, asking a court to require Oracle to meet what HP says are requirements that it continue to produce software that supports the Intel Itanium server processor. In the suit, filed in a California Superior Court in Santa Clara, HP accuses Oracle of engaging in a "calculated effort to thwart competition from HP and harm its customers," and asks the court to force Oracle to live up to contractual commitments to support mutual customers by reversing a decision to stop building software for the Intanium server processor. Oracle announced that it would cease development on Itanium-friendly software in March, sparking a very public row over a rather obscure chip, pitting Oracle against both HP and Intel, the maker of the Itanium chip. Oracle claimed that it was simply reacting to plans in place at HP and Intel to end work on the Itanium chip, plans about which it claimed neither HP nor Intel were being honest. Both HP and Intel say that's not the case and that long-term development plans for the chip are still in place. HP further accused Oracle of walking away from Itanium support in order to push customers toward its own hardware. It acquired Sun Microsystems last year. Oracle's position is at least somewhat understandable given Intel's recent repositioning of its Xeon server chip as "suitable for any workload," implying that any workload the expensive and exotic Itanium can do, the more mainstream and less costly Xeon can do just as well. Incidentally, not many servers with Itanium chips are sold, and pretty close to 100 percent of them are sold by HP. In the complaint, which is embedded below, HP accuses Oracle of failing to live up to a "clear and simple promise to work with HP in the interest of both companies' mutual customers." HP says that Oracle worked for years in partnership with HP and Intel on the Itanium platform, a partnership that by its existence encouraged several companies to make multi-million dollar investments in HP servers containing Itanium chips running Oracle software. "The promise of future compatibility is a material consideration in the purchase decision," HP's complaint says. "Oracle has now abandoned that approach and has made clear that it will no longer be governed by the best interests of customers, by the boundaries of a partnership, or by its contractual commitments and promises." HP says Oracle's ultimate aim was to discourage customers from buying more HP hardware and to encourage them to buy Oracle hardware. "When customers complained of critical software bugs that Oracle has a duty to fix, Oracle has refused to do so, demanding instead that customers move to the next version of the software, which Oracle says will not run HP's Itanium servers. Oracle has coupled this demand with below-cost offers to give away -- free of charge -- Sun servers that will run new versions of Oracle's software in an effort to get customers to accept Sun servers that they do not want," the complaint says. As you can see below, the complaint has been heavily redacted; several entire sections are blacked out in order to cover up certain confidential facts, which I think likely contain specific terms of a contractual agreement between Oracle and HP. HP Chief Information Officer Bill Wohl said HP sued after it failed to hear back from Oracle following its letter last week. Oracle wasn't silent in public, however. Sticking to its story that there is a plan in place to nudge the Itanium chip toward the end of its life, it called HP's accusations "not true." You can read its response in full below. REDWOOD SHORES, Calif., June 15, 2011 - Today HP filed a lawsuit claiming that Oracle had breached an agreement to support the Itanium microprocessor. It just takes a few minutes to read the early drafts of the agreement to prove that HP's claim is not true. What is true is that HP explicitly asked Oracle to guarantee continued support for Itanium; but Oracle refused, and HP's Itanium support guarantee wording was deleted from the final signed agreement. It is interesting, however, that way back in September of 2010, HP asked Oracle for a long-term commitment to support Itanium. At that time Oracle did not know that there was a plan already in place to end Itanium's life. Oracle did not learn about that plan until six months later, in March 2011. We believe that HP specifically asked Oracle to guarantee long-term support for Itanium in the September of 2010 agreement because HP already knew all about Intel's plans to discontinue Itanium, and HP was concerned about what would happen when Oracle found out about that plan. What we know for certain is that Ray Lane and HP's current board members and Leo Apotheker and HP's current management team now know full well that Intel has plans in place to end-of-life of the Itanium microprocessor. Knowing this, HP issued numerous public statements in an attempt mislead and deceive their customers and shareholders into believing that these plans to end-of-life Itanium do not exist. But they do. Intel's plans to end-of-life Itanium will be revealed in court now that HP has filed this utterly malicious and meritless lawsuit against Oracle. HP issued a similar statement summing up its position. The full complaint document is below that: HP believes that Oracle's March 22 statement to discontinue all future software development on the Itanium platform violates legally binding commitments Oracle has made to HP and the more than 140,000 shared HP-Oracle customers. Further, we believe that this is an unlawful attempt to force customers from HP Itanium platforms to Oracle's own platforms. As a result, on June 15, HP filed a civil lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California, for the County of Santa Clara, seeking Oracle to reverse its decision. HP believes that Oracle is legally obligated to continue to offer its software product suite on the Itanium platform and we will take whatever legal actions are available to us necessary to protect our customers' best interests and the significant investments they have made. HP remains committed to a long-term mission-critical server roadmap, including Intel's Itanium processor. Similarly, Intel has repeatedly reinforced its ongoing commitment to the Itanium roadmap.?

2003-04-23 - Helping JetBlue see black  People working at airlines don't like to talk about crashes, not even those affecting their computers. So it might seem strange to see a major airline turn to Windows, a product much maligned as crash-prone, as the only way to run a successful business. Yet for Jeff Cohen, chief information officer of JetBlue Airways, Windows is the only way to run a successful business--in fact, it's a nearly 100 percent Microsoft software operation. Certainly, it's hard to argue with the success of JetBlue's standardization approach. The company flies only Airbus A320 aircraft, of which it has 41, with plans to add a dozen more by the end of the year. Having a single kind of plane, the company hopes, means lower costs for training, maintenance and parts, because everything is interchangeable. JetBlue, which is one of just a few profitable airlines, saw its operating revenue jump 96 percent year over year in the fourth quarter and more than 98 percent for 2002 compared with the previous year. In an industry where competitors are flying to bankruptcy, JetBlue saw its fourth-quarter operating margins jump to 16.8 percent from 4.2 percent a year earlier. (The airline announces first-quarter earnings Thursday.) Cohen's organization would like to take some credit for those margin gains. By standardizing on one operating system and using other Microsoft software, the JetBlue CIO says he cut the company's technical staff by 50 percent. Electronic publishing of pilot manuals, which are available on a cockpit laptop, also helps cut costs. For Cohen, standardization of information technology, like the approach to the planes, is helping to keep JetBlue in the black when other airlines fly in the red. Q: Discuss your approach to a standardized IT infrastructure. A: When I joined the company in January 2000 and from my inception as VP and CIO in April 2000, I standardized on the Windows platform. I chose to do that because I felt from the server platform all the way out to the desktop and back that to have one type of operating system and to be able to train one type of technician and to be able to buy one type of software would put a great control on the total cost of ownership of the computing world within JetBlue. So we marched down the road of the Windows platform. We don't have any Unix; we don't have an AS/400; we don't have any mainframes--we don't have anything outside of Windows. There has been tremendous cost savings. We've also had about a 50 percent reduction in head count for the other platforms you might have to support in multi-operating system servers. I understand that you run Unisys servers on the back end; is that correct? We do. What I've done over the course of the last six or eight months--as the company has grown and applications have been considered critical enough, and the company has evolved the volume of data that makes sense--JetBlue basically went to a model where we were going to scale up rather than scaling out. Different flavors have different costs of ownership. I can tell you that I would need 50 percent more staff to run other operating systems. When I first started with the company, when we had systems that required more processing power, we just added more servers to handle the functionality. For instance, if it was a database and we needed to mirror the database, then we needed a second server. If we had an application running and we wanted to fail-over the application, then that was four servers. And if we wanted to put it on the Web, initially it might have been one server but ended up to be six or eight servers. All of that together got us a system at 12, 14, 16 servers, serving up one application. That sounds like a lot of administration. From an administration perspective, that was pretty difficult. If the application failed, it was difficult to tell where the problems were, so from a manageability perspective it was more difficult. From an administrative perspective, it was more difficult. And in the end, from a scalability perspective, it was more difficult. So as an IT organization, we made a decision about seven or eight months ago that we would purchase our first Unisys ES7000. That server was one of the first beta Itanium 2 systems that were delivered...That system was used initially, is being used, for our data warehouse deployment. We have since purchased a Unisys ES7000 for our maintenance and engineering systems. What's happened over the last eight months is everything that's mission-critical has been moved or is being moved to these scale-up boxes rather than scale out. Is that second server Itanium 2? The second server is not Itanium 2. That's a 32-bit server running 32-bit applications. What version of Windows Server are you running on those boxes? We are running Windows Server 2003 Datacenter--the 64-bit version--on the Itanium 2. We are running Windows Server 2003 Datacenter--the 32-bit version--on the other Unisys server. Can I assume you are running some version of SQL Server for your database? It's Windows SQL Server 2000 64-bit on one and it's the Oracle system on the other, because that's what the manufacturer who makes the (application software) requires. We truly try to run a 100 percent Microsoft environment to keep the cost down; but if there are applications that we buy from vendors, whatever the required database is, that's what we run. What other systems do you have? The Unisys ES7000; I bought another one to run our frequent-flyer program. Today that's running on the HP rx5670 Itanium server, but we are moving it to the Unisys ES7000 Itanium 2. That thing probably gets a couple thousand hits an hour. How many users do you have? And do you have Windows XP running on the desktop? We have about 2,500 today, and we have Windows XP on the desktop. Which version of Office do you use? Currently we are running Office XP predominately, but we're already running Office 2003 on about 200 desktops. What's the attraction of Office 2003 for you over Office XP? The 2003 version has (Extensible Markup Language) XML savings format built in. The 2003 version has a much better version of Outlook, which has a special caching mode that cuts down on network connectivity time. Office 2003 has a lot of very good feature sets built into the product that will be cost-saving to JetBlue. How do you plan to use XML throughout your organization? We're going to actually convert our company manuals to XML. Do you have an Intranet? Are you using any of the portal software from Microsoft? We use SharePoint Portal. We deployed version one as a beta customer, and we are currently a beta customer for version two. We have one of the only paperless cockpits in the sky. Are your desktops all standardized on one vendor? They are standardized on one vendor, and that's HP Compaq. We use notebooks as well. We were standardized on HP, and now it's on HP Compaq. Could you further discuss your cost savings from standardizing on one platform? I have 20 developers today. They only develop in Visual Studio .Net. If tomorrow, I put Linux in my environment, I would have to hire server people to build, monitor, maintain and administrate those servers, and I would have to hire a development staff to develop applications under the Linux operating system. That's an awful lot of people. Today we don't have that, because everything's Windows. Every technician that works on a server works on a Windows server. Every technician working on a desktop works on a Windows desktop. That's quite a bit easier than other flavors of desktops or OS/2 or whatever else is out there. Different flavors have different costs of ownership. I can tell you that I would need 50 percent more staff to run other operating systems. What are some of the other different ways you are using technology to remain lean and competitive? Well, we have one of the only paperless cockpits in the sky. On the Windows Server 2003 platform there is a service that runs in Windows called the distributed file system. For regulatory purposes with the FAA, in and around airlines there must be manuals and the manuals must be up to date. JetBlue uses the distributed file system to publish the documents, and then we built an application that we call Bluebooks, which runs on the pilot laptop. That ensures when the pilot logs in he has the most up-to-date set of manuals. We make manual changes a couple of times a week. We have 500 pilots, so think about what the printing costs are to print multiple pages for pilots every single week and then to distribute them to the pilots. Then think of all those pilot man-hours it would take to put all of those in the books and the old pages pulled out. The other way, the pilot plugs in and he's up to date. How else do you use these pilot laptops? One of the other things we do on the laptops is weight and balance. Every airline on every flight must do weight and balance of the plane--basically where the baggage is, how many people--because that tells them what numbers to set on all of their gauges as part of the computer system of the plane. They need to figure out how much fuel is needed--all of those things are done by a weight-and-balance program. JetBlue is one of the few airlines that does weight and balance right on the plane.
2004-06-30 - Hardware kingpin Intel beefs up software business  Intel hardware dominates the PC market, but a new emphasis on software could help the chipmaker expand into other markets and foster greater innovation, even if the effort could rankle longtime allies like Microsoft. Best known for producing the processors that have been at the heart of the PC industry for more than 20 years, Intel has quietly amassed an army of more than 8,000 software engineers, according to sources familiar with the company. Executives at the chipmaker declined to comment on the specific number, choosing only to confirm that it has more than 5,000 coders. But the number has grown rapidly in the past few years, as the company has expanded its product lines. While much of the group's efforts still go into simply making Intel's hardware work, many of the engineers are now working to create new user interfaces, write Linux software and add features for Windows PCs that might have been left to more traditional software companies in the past. News.context What's new: Increasingly, "Intel inside" means Intel software, as well as hardware, in a host of computing devices. Bottom line: Intel has some 8,000 employees writing code. It's not looking to compete with Microsoft, but as that key partner's development cycles stretch out, someone has to create the software for Intel's relentless flow of new products. More stories on Intel The rising importance of software is part of a lesser-known aspect of the chipmaker's evolution over the last few years: Rather than simply pumping out faster chips and selling them to PC makers, the company is gestating entire product categories. One example is the launch of its Centrino notebook chip bundle, which tied a low-power processor to a wireless module and chipset. With products such as Centrino, software is an important part of weaving together the components. It's a change that will become increasingly evident over the next few years, as Intel unwraps several initiatives to boost the functionality of PCs and seeks to strengthen its presence in the consumer electronics markets. "We're looking at products and markets a lot more holistically. Not just computing, but communications, but also software as part of the offering," Paul Otellini, Intel's president, said in a recent interview with CNET News.com. "We ship more and more lines of code with every new platform offering than we ever did." An OS is not on the horizon While its efforts range from delivering development tools to creating drivers and applications for Windows, Intel isn't exactly planning to launch its own PC operating system. Instead, software serves the purpose of enabling new features and opening new markets. One such application is a version of Intel's PROset software, which controls the wireless module that's part of its Centrino bundle. Intel will deliver a similar version of the application that helps consumers set up wireless access points in PCs containing its Express 915 and 925 chipsets, which were released last week. The utility reduces setup of the optional access point to a few mouse clicks. The access points eliminate the need for a separate wireless router--a business that Microsoft recently retreated from. Intel isn't alone among hardware makers who have determined that software is crucial to driving innovation. Sun Microsystems has increased its software development efforts over the past year. The company introduced Java-based desktop and server software, and new management tools, all geared toward offsetting a slide in hardware sales. IBM increasingly sees its software division as a strategic weapon to drive both hardware and consulting sales. It's also a source of profits. The company sold $28 billion worth of hardware in 2003, generating profits of just under $8 billion, while its software group generated sales of just over $14 billion, but netted $12 billion in profits, according to IBM's annual report. (Not) waiting for Wintel But the reasons for Intel's efforts are unique, coming as the product development cycle has lengthened for longtime PC ally Microsoft (one half of the so-called Wintel alliance), potentially curbing Intel's ability to roll out new features unless it also writes some software to enable those functions. Between Windows 95 and Windows XP, a new operating system was on store shelves roughly every two years. But since XP was released in 2001, no new operating system has been produced, and Microsoft does not expect the next version, code-named Longhorn, to be available for two more years. Microsoft has said its focus on security has been partly responsible for the expected six-year gap. "Right now, Intel's got a schedule that doesn't at all correspond to Microsoft's." --Kevin Krewell, editor, Microprocessor Report In contrast, Intel adds new features to its chipsets frequently to encourage consumers to upgrade and to keep ahead of competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices. Intel typically launches one major new chipset per PC product line per year and usually delivers new processor speeds quarterly. "Intel is getting ahead of Microsoft because Microsoft takes so long to qualify all of this (software). Then it must collect it and add to service packs and (new OS) releases," said Kevin Krewell, editor of the Microprocessor Report. "Intel wants to move faster than that. So it's a matter of timing and whether Microsoft's and Intel's visions coincide--and at some points they don't. Right now, Intel's got a schedule that doesn't at all correspond to Microsoft's." Whether that leads to a clash is unclear, but there is some work being done by the two companies that could become a flash point. Intel's Mobile Products Group, for example, has already produced and licensed software to other parties. The group created Extended Mobile Access, or EMA, a small secondary screen for Centrino notebooks designed to make the machines more functional and therefore more desirable to businesses executives who frequently dash between meetings. The screen allows users to remain connected to a wireless network and monitor e-mail--without opening the lid or interacting with Windows, which can be in standby mode. Jonathan Joseph, CEO of Insyde Software, said he licensed the software from Intel and has taken over the job of marketing it as a product. It's now called InsydeAxS and the screens will appear in several business Centrino notebooks later this year. Consumer models could follow. Intel "did the basic software development and gave it to us to productize," Joseph said. "It was meant to be a product, not just a concept." Meanwhile, Microsoft has discussed a similar idea for auxiliary screens, although it's not expected to deliver such a product until Longhorn is released. Intel has also written several other Windows applications, which it gives to PC makers to include with their systems. The chipmaker is including software such as Experience 7.1 Surround Sound (the 7.1 relates to surround sound, not the application), which allows someone to set up his or her own surround-sound functions on a desktop that use Intel's new 900-series desktop PC chipsets. The application features a map of the speakers and, through a point-and-click menu, users can perform tasks such as setting the balance between the speakers. A storage utility, which permits users to connect and remove hard drives through a software menu, is also included. Still very close friends... That raises the question of whether Intel, which has traditionally worked very closely with Microsoft to align its chipset features with Windows, will do more work on its own so it can build new features and target new markets, such as digital home products. Not necessarily, said Intel spokesman Scott McLaughlin. "In a lot of the (software) engagements, Microsoft is right there with us," he said. "We work with Microsoft an awful lot. We're not in the OS business. So on things like Itanium (the 64-bit Intel server chip), we had to work closely with Microsoft" to generate software for the chip. "We work with Microsoft an awful lot. We're not in the OS business." --Scott McLaughlin, Intel spokesman But the companies haven't always seen eye-to-eye when it comes to such efforts. Testimony given by an Intel executive during the 1998 Microsoft antitrust trial claimed Microsoft threatened Intel over an audio/visual software technology called Native Signal Processing that the chipmaker was developing. Microsoft vigorously disputed the Intel executive's testimony, however. Intel has also aided Microsoft competitor Real Networks' video-streaming software, indicating that while the companies have long worked together when needed, they're also willing to pursue objectives that could put a strain on their relationship. "Microsoft and Intel have a long history of collaboration and cooperation on a wide range of software and hardware topics...all of which are focused on delivering the best possible technologies, products and programs to our joint customers," a Microsoft representative told CNET News.com in a statement. "Microsoft values the open and direct dialogue we share with Intel. It has led to a successful working relationship that results in product innovation and which benefits customers and the industry." That delicate balance, however, could be tested as Intel's 8,000 software engineers pump out new products during the next two years while Microsoft prepares its sequel to Windows XP.

2024-05-15 - Google's Gemini 15 Pro Will Have 2 Million Tokens Here's What That Means   In the world of large language models, the tech underpinning generative AI, size matters. And Google said it's allowing users to feed its Gemini 1.5 Pro model more data than ever.During theGoogle I/O developers conference on Tuesday, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Google is increasing Gemini 1.5 Pro's context window from 1 million to 2 million tokens. Pichai said the update will be made available to developers in "private preview," but stopped short of saying when it may be available more broadly.More from Google I/O 2024 Google I/O 2024: Everything Announced at the KeynoteAt Google I/O, Gemini Really Wants to Talk With YouGoogle's Gemini Assistant Pushes Android Into Its Next Phase"It's amazing to look back and see just how much progress we've made in a few months," Pichaisaidafter announcing that Google is doublingGemini 1.5 Pro'scontext window. "And this represents the next step on our journey towards the ultimate goal of infinite context."Large language models, or LLMs like Gemini 1.5 Pro, are AI models that are trained on enormous amounts of data to understand language so that tools like Gemini -- the search giant's competitor toChatGPT-- can generate content that humans can understand. Doubling Gemini 1.5 Pro's context window from 1 million to 2 million tokens could dramatically improve the results you get from Google's LLM. But tokens, context windows and other AI jargon is decidedly nebulous. And without some of that context Pichai was so interested in discussing, it may be difficult to know why 2 million tokens is such a big deal.Read on for a primer on tokens, and how increasing the number can change how you use and interact with Gemini going forward. And for more on Gemini and other AI tools likeChatGPT,Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity and Claude as well as news, tips and explainers on all things AI, check out CNET's AI Atlas resource.What are tokens in AI?In AI, tokens are pieces of words that the LLM evaluates to understand the broader context of a query. Each token is made up of four characters in English. Those characters can be letters and numbers, of course, but also spaces, special characters and more. It's also important to note that an individual token's length will vary by language. As AI models add the ability to analyze images, video and audio, they similarly use tokens to get the full picture. If you input an image into a model for context, AI models will break the picture down into parts, with each part representing tokens.Tokens are used both as inputs and outputs. So when users input a query into an AI model, the model itself breaks down the words into tokens, analyzes it, and delivers a response in tokens that are then converted into words that humans understand.OpenAI, the company that owns ChatGPT, offers a handy example for understanding tokens. Have you ever heard hockey great Wayne Gretzky's famous quote, "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take?" That sentence is made up of 11 tokens. If you swap out the percentage symbol for the word percent, the token count increases to 13 tokens.If you're interested in seeing how many tokens make up your text, check out OpenAI's Tokenizer tool, which allows you to input text and see how many tokens it uses.Understanding how many tokens are contained in any word or sentence is important. The more tokens available in a context window, the more data you can input into a query and the more data the AI model will understand and use to deliver results. Watch this: Google Introduces New AI Tools for Music, Video and Images 07:51 What does the context window do?No conversation about tokens is complete without explaining the context window. Indeed, it's in the context window where tokens are used -- and matter most.Think of a context window as the length of your memory. The bigger the context window, the more memory you can access to understand what someone is saying and answer them appropriately. Context windows help AI models remember information and reuse it to deliver better results to users. The larger the context windows (meaning, the more tokens it can use in a dialogue with users), the better its results."You might have had an experience where a chatbot 'forgot' information after a few turns," Google wrote in a blog post earlier this year. "That's where long context windows can help."Why would it be better to have more tokens?So, why are more tokens better? It comes down to simple math.The more tokens a context window can accept, the more data you can input into a model. The more data you can input, the more information the AI model can use to deliver responses. The better the responses, the more valuable the experience of using an AI model.Think of it this way: If you wanted to get a synopsis about an important moment in world history, only giving an AI model a sentence to digest and deliver a summary wouldn't be all that useful. But imagine feeding it an entire book about the event and the superior result you'll receive. The latter case is only made possible with more tokens.When will Google's updated context window be available?Google's updated context window is only launching on its Gemini 1.5 Pro model for now. Pichai said it'll be available to developers in a "private preview" first, with Google revealing later during the I/O event that it would be launched "later this year." So, stay tuned.What is infinite context and when will we get there?Pichai referenced a future in which we'll get to "infinite context," a point at which LLMs will be able to ingest and output an infinite amount of data, effectively giving them access to all the world's knowledge to deliver superior results. But truth be told, we're nowhere close.One of the problems with increasing tokens is that it takes more compute power with each increase. And while infinite context is indeed something AI supporters are looking forward to, no one can say for sure when, or even if, compute power would reach a level where that's possible.In a blog post in February, Google touted how at the time, Gemini 1.5 Pro supported 1 million tokens. And while the company acknowledged that it is working on expanding context windows, at the time, its research was able to achieve only a context window of 10 million tokens -- a far cry from infinite.However, as you continue to use AI models, expect context windows to increase not only from Google, but other providers, as well. And along the way, enjoy the better results expanded token availability makes possible.Editor's note: CNET is using an AI engine to help create a handful of stories.

2004-04-21 - GM springs for IBM supercomputer   General Motors has purchased an IBM supercomputer capable of performing 9 trillion calculations per second to speed up crash and safety simulations, a significant shot in the arm for Big Blue's supercomputer effort. The system, a cluster of Unix servers connected with a high-speed network, will use more than 2,000 processors. About half are in a collection of 145 p655 servers being installed now that use IBM's Power4 processor, and the remainder are Power5 processors in servers scheduled to arrive by the end of the year, GM and IBM executives said Wednesday. The system, twice as fast as an earlier IBM supercomputer at GM, is "most likely the most powerful system of any industrial company," said Frank Roney, IBM's lead salesman for the GM account, in a news conference. The companies wouldn't disclose the system's price. The performance of GM's new machine--9 trillion calculations per second, or 9 teraflops--is equivalent to the fourth-fastest system on the most recent list of top 500 supercomputers, though that list will be updated at least once by the time GM's system is fully operational. The GM supercomputer will be used to improve automotive safety research by simulating crashes with mathematical models rather than performing real-world crash tests, said Robert A. Kruse Jr., GM's executive director of vehicle integration. "At a cost of $500,000 per (crash test) vehicle, this has resulted in substantial savings," as well as the ability to test more designs than was previously possible, Kruse said. IBM is amid a concerted attack on the high-performance technical computing market, which includes not just mammoth systems such as GM's but also a large number of much smaller systems. Big Blue is No. 2 in the market but is gaining on top-ranked Hewlett-Packard, according to market researcher IDC. In 2003, high-performance technical computing revenue grew 13.8 percent overall to $5.4 billion, but IBM's sales grew faster--21.9 percent to $1.62 billion. From 2002 to 2003, IBM's share of the market grew from 28.2 percent to 30.2 percent while HP, with $1.79 billion in revenue for 2003, shrank slightly from 33.6 percent to 33.5 percent. Next in line were Sun, with $981 million in revenue, Dell with $387 million, Silicon Graphics with $224 million, Cray with $157 million and NEC with $67.5 million, according to IDC. For the high-performance technical computing market, IBM sells Unix servers with Power processors as well as clusters of Linux servers using Advanced Micro Devices and Intel processors. It's also working on an experimental design called Blue Gene. IBM is aiming its Power line chiefly at Intel's Itanium chip family today, but Power chips also are used in Apple computers and future Sony gaming consoles, and Big Blue is trying to make it easier for others to expand the Power chip family. IBM's Power-based servers chiefly run IBM's version of Unix, AIX, but the company is pushing Linux as well. Indeed, Blue Gene uses a Power processor variant and Linux. While the high-performance technical computing market is vastly smaller than the overall server market, IBM--along with competitors including Sun, Dell and HP--sell technology that works for both types of customers. IBM also competes with specialists such as Cray and Silicon Graphics that have had divergent fortunes this week. Cray on Monday sold its X1 supercomputer to the U.S. Army's Space and Missile Defense Command. SGI, meanwhile, reported a net loss of $7 million for its quarter ended March 26, narrower than the $48 million from a year earlier, but said order rates weren't as strong as it projected. SGI's revenue increased 6 percent from $217 million to $230 million.
2000-08-28 - Glitch prompts Intel to recall 113-GHz Pentiums    Intel has recalled its fastest chip--the 1.13-GHz Pentium III--saying the chip could cause system errors when running certain programs and at a particular temperature. The problem is with certain circuits of the chip that have been shown to malfunction in laboratory tests under certain conditions, said Intel spokesman Howard High. Intel said it has not received reports from customers of any problems, but the glitch has been noted by some hardware review sites in recent days. As first reported by CNET News.com, Dell Computer and IBM have stopped shipping PCs with the processor. Intel said it will work with those companies to satisfy existing customers. "Clearly if they want a replacement, then we will replace (it)," High said. "If they want a refund, we'll accommodate them." The 1.13-GHz chip began shipping July 31 in limited quantities. Intel would not say exactly how many 1.13 GHz chips have shipped, but analysts said the number is quite small. "There can't be very many--tens of thousands at most," said Linley Gwennap, principal analyst at The Linley Group. "I wouldn't be surprised if it was under 10,000." Word of the glitch comes on the same day as rival Advanced Micro Devices announced shipments of its 1.1-GHz Athlon. Analysts say competition with AMD may have caused Intel to release a chip that wasn't ready. "It sounds like Intel may have pushed a little too hard," said chip analyst Peter Glaskowsky of MicroDesign Resources. "It shows the Pentium III is not really capable of reaching these levels." Gwennap noted that Intel did not originally have the 1.13-GHz chip on its road map and has struggled to produce the 1-GHz chip in enough quantity to satisfy customers. "When you push the clock speed beyond what it was designed to do, you run into problems," Gwennap said. "They rushed to get the 1-GHz chip out, and they couldn't produce enough of them." Intel said it has identified the cause of the problem and will fix it by redesigning the circuits in question. "It's probably a couple of months before we get units back into the marketplace," High said. Although other Pentium III processors have the same design, Intel said it has not found the same problem in other chips. "We've done quite a bit of testing, and we haven't seen anything," High said. Intel said the fact that it had not shipped many of the processors will make the problem easier to remedy than past glitches, such as the bug with the 820 chipset. In that case, computer motherboards with the defective chipset were sold through distributors and available in computers from many retailers. "We're kind of early in the process, which is a benefit with something like this," High said. Only Dell, IBM and a few European companies had been selling systems with the 1.13-GHz chip. Intel said it is recalling chips that have not yet been sold and has halted its shipments of the processor. High said various computer hardware review sites began noting a problem with certain kernels of the Linux operating system. Intel at first could replicate the problem only when the chips were operated outside recommended temperature specifications. Over the weekend, it began noticing problems even within the chip's specifications. Intel executives said it was too soon to say how much the bug might cost, but the cost will not be material to Intel's earnings. In addition to the glitch that forced the recall of the 820 and the delay of the low-end Timna chip, Intel has had delays and performance issues with its forthcoming Itanium chip, which is aimed at high-end servers. Gwennap noted that Intel's manufacturing woes over the past year--and AMD's success--reverse what had been the trend. "For a long time, Intel was this machine that couldn't break and AMD couldn't take two steps without tripping," Gwennap said. "For the past year, Intel has been having problem after problem, and AMD keeps cranking out more and more chips." Gwennap said that while the Pentium III may have hit its limit, Intel will be able to introduce chips at much faster speeds when it debuts the Pentium 4 later this year. The Pentium 4 design "clearly allows higher clock speeds," Gwennap said. "That's one of the reasons they are moving to a new architecture."
2005-02-25 - Fujitsu's behemoth Itanium server imminent Fujitsu is expected to announce a major new server design in coming weeks, a refrigerator-size machine that uses up to 64 Itanium 2 processors and promises high-end features incorporating the company's mainframe expertise. The system is the culmination of a Fujitsu-Intel partnership announced in 2003. However, it's a few months late--the 64-processor model was due by the end of 2004, with a 128-processor successor scheduled to arrive by the end of 2005. Fujitsu declined to comment on the system. But in a presentation at last week's LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, an executive said in a presentation that the system is "coming soon." One source familiar with the plan said the Fujitsu system is scheduled to arrive in April. The server is expected to run both Windows and Linux. Fujitsu has signed partnerships with Microsoft and Red Hat to help bring high-end server features to Windows and Linux. The Itanium machine is one major part of Fujitsu's work to transfer its expertise in mainframes--high-end systems that are flexible, reliable and able to process high volumes of transactions--to more mainstream server designs. At the same time it's supporting Itanium, though, Fujitsu has a partnership with Sun Microsystems to bring mainframe features to jointly designed systems that uses Sparc processors. Among mainframe features coming with the Itanium line will be the ability to divide the system into as many as 16 partitions, each with its own operating system. It also will have a Fujitsu-designed "crossbar" switch for routing traffic internally among different processors and the input-output subsystem, Fujitsu said. Fujitsu already sells Itanium machines, but they're relatively undistinguished four-processor models based on an Intel design. Intel's Itanium--developed with Hewlett-Packard--hasn't met Intel's scaled-back goals. However, several companies still sell in-house Itanium designs--chiefly HP but also Silicon Graphics Inc., NEC, Hitachi, IBM and Unisys. Dell also sells Intel's Itanium server designs under its own name. The biggest competitor for the system is HP's Superdome, which can accommodate as many as 128 Itanium 2 processors. Although SGI sells Itanium servers with hundreds of processors, those products are geared for the high-performance technical-computing niche.
2005-04-05 - Fujitsu unveils two Itanium 2 servers  Fujitsu unveiled two new Itanium 2 servers on Tuesday, another step in the Japanese giant's plan to expand its customer base. The Primequest 480 and 440 servers emerge from a 2-year-old alliance with Intel to promote that company's Itanium 2 processor. With the new servers, Fujitsu will be able to offer customers four different kinds of servers: mainframes based on Fujitsu's own technology, Unix/RISC servers from a technology relationship with Sun Microsystems, Itanium servers running Windows or Linux and cheaper servers with Intel Xeon servers. Fujitsu sells the mainframe only in Japan, but the rest of the families are available worldwide. The Primequest servers, which can hold up to 32 processors (the 480) or 16 processors (the 440), are designed to allow Fujitsu to displace older mainframes or Unix servers from Hewlett-Packard or IBM. Fujitsu earlier said a 128-processor Itanium 2 server will come out at the end of this year, but that plan has been scrapped. Itanium 2 servers continue to represent only a small sliver of the overall server market and have not met expectations. However, sales are growing. The company hopes to ship 10,000 of these servers in the next three years, which could bring $2 billion in revenue to Fujitsu, said Chiaki Ito, corporate executive vice president of the Fujitsu conglomerate and a company board member. Although not one of the "big four" server labels in North America, Fujitsu has made a concerted effort to expand in the last two years, particularly in North America. It has struck up relationships with Red Hat Software, for instance, and co-develops processors with Sun. Last year, server sales outside of Japan were increasing by 190 percent year over year, although from a small base, Akira Yamanaka, corporate vice president of Fujitsu, said in an interview. Ironically, some of the company's new clients were moving from Sun, he said. The Primequest server will initially run the "Madison" version of the Itanium 2 chip and a chipset from Fujitsu. Future versions will run the dual-core "Montecito" processor and chipsets from Intel as well. Some of the features on Primequest include System Mirror, which allows an administrator to let one processor and bank of memory mirror the function of another. In the case of a problem or part failure, the computer won't stall. Another feature, Flexible I/O, lets an administrator redirect input-output resources from different processors online. Fujitsu came out with an Itanium 2 server in late 2003, but it was largely designed by Intel. The Primequest servers are the first with substantial design input from Fujitsu and its mainframe division. The server will ship in Japan in June and come to North America in September. Toyota has already installed an early version of the server, Ito said. Right now, Red Hat Linux Enterprise Edition runs on it, but Suse Linux and Windows Server 2003 will be available in September. Ito also diplomatically sidestepped the issue of whether offering servers running Sun and Intel chips creates a conflict. "We can serve more customer needs by having both," he said.
2004-06-22 - Fujitsu revs faster server chip    Fujitsu said Tuesday it has boosted the speed of its Sparc64 V processor with a new manufacturing process, a move made more significant in light of the Japanese company's server partnership with Sun Microsystems. Joining forces to compete better against the No. 1 and No. 2 server sellers, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, Sun and Fujitsu agreed to merge their server lines in a deal announced this month. In an early step in the partnership, Sun plans for the first time to sell Fujitsu's Sparc64-based products later this year. Fujitsu builds the faster Sparc64 V with a manufacturing process that permits features with a size of 90 nanometers, meaning that more circuitry can be squeezed onto a chip built with the earlier 130-nanometer process. The new chips run at 1.89GHz and have 3MB of on-board cache memory, compared with 1.35GHz and 2MB for existing Sparc64 V models. The new chip won't ship in servers until later in 2004, Fujitsu said. In higher-end systems--the Primepower 900, 1500 and 2500 models--the new chips can be mixed with the older versions. Fujitsu's next-generation Sparc64 VI chips, which come with sophisticated reliability features, will be used in one product line with anywhere from one to 128 processors, with Sun designing the lower-end models and both companies designing the top-end models, the companies said. Fujitsu's Primepower machines can run the same software as Sun's machines, including the Solaris version of Unix. But the Sun Fire products, which today use Sun's UltraSparc processor, currently have greater market share. Although Sun has agreed to incorporate Fujitsu's processors and independently scrapped its own UltraSparc V, it's also keeping some next-generation chips of its own code-named Rock and Niagara. Sun will design these systems and Texas Instruments will manufacture the chips, but both Sun and Fujitsu will sell them, the companies said. Fujitsu also has a deal to build high-end servers with Itanium processors from Intel, along with IBM and Sun's biggest chipmaking rival.
2003-12-17 - Fujitsu launches Itanium server    Fujitsu's U.S. computer subsidiary has begun its first major foray into the Itanium server market, with the launch of a system that modestly boosts Intel's push for the high-end processor. Fujitsu has begun taking orders for the Primergy RXI600, which comes with up to four Itanium chips, and will begin shipping the systems in January, Jon Rodriguez, Primergy server's product manager, said in an interview Tuesday. The Japanese company is a recent convert to Intel's pitch of Itanium as a competitor to other high-end processors, chiefly to Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc and to IBM's Power. Itanium systems have got off to a slow start with server manufacturers, hampered by chip delays and by the incompatibility of Itanium with software written for the vast number of machines based on Intel's Xeon and Pentium processors. According to research firm IDC, 4,957 Itanium-based servers were sold in the third quarter of 2003. That compares with sales of about 769,000 for Xeon servers and of 10,746 for systems using Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron, a 64-bit chip introduced in April that can run Xeon software. IDC analyst Jean Bozman said Itanium server shipments look likely to increase, given that HP began selling its full line of the machines in November. "We should begin to see the numbers move up," she said. Fujitsu expects the Itanium situation to improve because Microsoft began shipping an Itanium version of Windows in April. The company also believes that Intel software called IA32-EL, which lets an Itanium better emulate a Xeon processor, will make Itanium more useful to customers who have Xeon servers. Although Itanium hasn't caught on as fast as Intel hoped, the chipmaker has succeeded in convincing several companies besides Hewlett-Packard, the initiator of the Itanium idea and the processor's loudest backer, to sell systems using the chip. Other companies that offer Itanium servers include Unisys, IBM, Dell, NEC, Hitachi and Silicon Graphics. Fujitsu is selling the Primergy RXI600 with two 1.3GHz Itanium 2 processors and 8GB of memory for $26,500, Rodriguez said. A system with four 1.5GHz processors and the maximum 32GB of memory has a list price of $69,500. The RXI600 is based on Intel's Itanium server design "Tiger" but includes Fujitsu's own management and set-up software, Rodriguez said. However, Fujitsu plans to offer a more powerful Itanium server of its own design in 2005, according to Rodriguez. At first, that system will accommodate as many as 32 processors, though a 128-processor machine is also in the works. Fujitsu sells Primergy servers using Intel's Xeon processors for midrange and low-end jobs. For higher-end tasks, it builds Primepower systems with its own Sparc64 processor that can run Sun Microsystems' Solaris operating system. Fujitsu Computer Systems, Fujitsu's Sunnyvale, Calif.-based subsidiary that sells servers in the North America, was formed from a merger this year of Fujitsu's U.S. server and PC sales divisions.
2003-06-23 - From Intel New P4 chip Itanium plans   Intel on Monday came out with a Pentium 4 running at 3.2GHz and separately has plans to discuss a new version of its upcoming Madison chip specially enhanced for dual-processor servers and workstations. The 3.2GHz Pentium 4 will likely be the fastest desktop chip on the market for a few months. The Pentium 4 has already opened a slight gap over the rival Athlon from Advanced Micro Devices, according to benchmark testers, and AMD is not expected to come out with another desktop chip until September when the Athlon64 debuts. PCs containing AMD chips often sell for less than do computers running Intel chips of the same speed. The 2GHz PowerPC 970, coming out in new Power Macs, will likely be close in performance to these chips, said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64, but the 2GHz chip won't likely hit store shelves for a while, he added. The new Pentium 4 will also probably be one of the last, if not the last, of the classic Pentium 4s. In the second half of the year, the company plans to unveil the successor to the Pentium 4, code-named Prescott. Prescott is based on the same basic architecture, but contains new instructions for multimedia processing, as well as other features. "It's more than likely" the last classic Pentium 4, said Brookwood. Brookwood added that Prescott, although different from the current Pentium 4s, may still be sold under the Pentium 4 name. Still, historically, Intel often reaches for the new-name bag whenever instructions or other significant features are added. Like other high-end Intel processors, the new chip features hyperthreading, which allows the processor to do two things at once fairly efficiently, such as running virus scans and compressing video. It will also be matched with chipsets with buses running as fast as 800MHz. The new chip will cost $637 in 1,000 unit quantities. Intel cut prices on its other desktop chips earlier this month. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. The company also is coming out with a version of Madison, the upcoming new version of the Itanium 2 chip, specially designed for dual-processor systems, according to Tom Gibbs, director of industry marketing at Intel. Although Gibbs declined to provide technical details behind this previously undisclosed version of Madison, or how it will differ from other versions of the chip, he said that the chip would likely end up in servers for high-performance clusters. Clusters--conglomerations of one- and two-processor servers that can take on tasks that just a few years ago had to be handled by supercomputers--are fueling Intel's growth in the high-performance and scientific computing market. Although still complex, clusters are far easier to build than monolithic supercomputers. Madison, which sources say will come out June 30, is the successor to the current Itanium 2, which was known as McKinley. Madison will run at 1.5GHz and contain between 3MB and 6MB of cache, a comparatively large amount. Overall, it will deliver 50 percent better performance than McKinley, Intel claims. Early benchmarks submitted by Hewlett-Packard show that Madison will rank with the fastest server chips on the market. To date, Itanium sales have been sluggish, but Intel appears to be getting more support from computer manufacturers this time around. Dell Computer, which skipped McKinley, is expected to come out with a Madison server. In March, Intel President Paul Otellini said that there would be around 40 different Itanium computers on the market containing two to four processors and 10 containing more than four in 2003, double the number in 2002. AMD, meanwhile, is expected to announce a version of its Opteron chip for eight-processor servers by the end of the quarter, which ends June 30, said sources.
2000-03-31 - Former Intel worker indicted in trade secrets case A former Intel employee was indicted by a U.S. grand jury on charges of stealing trade secrets about the company's upcoming Itanium microprocessor, federal prosecutors said. Say Lye Ow, 29, of Malaysia, faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1.5 million fine for taking documents and computer files related to the design and testing of the Itanium microprocessor, said the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Jose, Calif. The Itanium, which is scheduled to be released later this year, is Intel's foray into the world of high-powered computers that can run everything from bank systems to online businesses. Intel and Hewlett-Packard have jointly developed Itanium, a 64-bit processor. Ow, who worked for Intel in an undisclosed capacity, took the trade secrets to a new employer, an Intel competitor, federal authorities said. They declined to identify Ow's new employer, saying the company is cooperating with investigators. Copyright 2000, Bloomberg L.P. All rights reserved.
2004-09-07 - For Intel the future has two cores SAN FRANCISCO--Intel is trying to make the case that a collection of chips is worth more than the sum of its parts. The chipmaker presented its argument in several ways on Tuesday. For one, Intel said it has seen a benefit in marketing several chips together, as it has done with Centrino, its bundle of technology for wireless notebook PCs. Speaking at the Intel Developer Forum here, Intel President Paul Otellini said the next target for such a bundle will be the home PC, which is being transformed from a productivity machine into a home entertainment center that demands both speed and new features, such as content protection. Intel also believes that its future lies in dual-core chips, a single piece of silicon with two multiprocessor cores. The company scrapped plans for a faster traditional Pentium 4 in favor of the "two is better than one" approach. In 2005, Intel will release dual-core chips for servers, desktops and laptops, Otellini said. By 2006, the company expects about half of its chips to have such a design, with all future products being designed around multiple cores. As expected, Otellini discussed some of Intel's dual-core plans during his presentation. The various moves are aimed at giving Intel a prime position in the digital home and to help the company protect its traditional stronghold in the business market. The plan for the long term comes as Intel is warning that the near-term PC market may not be all that strong. The company on Thursday cut its financial outlook for the current quarter, sending shivers down the spines of some of its Wall Street watchers. Otellini said the chip industry has recovered from the dot-com bust, with 2004 likely to set a new record for communications chip sales and possibly for microprocessors. "We are seeing the surge after the bubble," he said. "A better way" But there's lots of work to do still. As part of its overall effort, Intel is increasingly working to shift the focus--that of its own designers and also of its customers--from raw clock speed to improvements by way of adding new features, including releasing so-called dual-core processors and technology like Vanderpool, which will work to allow PCs to run multiple independent operating systems at the same time. "This is a better way to think about our products," Otellini said in his keynote. "It is a better way to market our products." "This is not a race. This is a sea change in computing, and we ought not to look at this as a race." --Paul Otellini, president, Intel Dual-core chips, which Intel has pledged to bring out in significant numbers next year, will boost the overall performance of PCs and allow them to run different jobs simultaneously--such as watching a video and surfing the Web at the same time. "We are dedicating all of our future product development to multicore designs," Otellini said. "We believe this is a key inflection point for the industry." He said 40 percent of desktop chips and 70 percent of notebooks chips that Intel ships in 2006 will be dual-core. Of server chips, 85 percent will be dual-core, he added. The dual-core mobile processor is code-named Yonah, Otellini said in a meeting with reporters. During the speech, Abhi Talwalkar, vice president of Intel's enterprise platforms group, joined Otellini to show off a dual-core version of Montecito, Intel's next Itanium chip. The Montecito chip includes two cores that will each be capable of executing two simultaneous instruction threads. Thus when Talwalker showed a server with four Montecito processors running Windows, the machine was running 16 independent tasks at the same time, as each chip had two cores and so sported four threads. Right now, dual-core chips are standard in high-end servers, but not the mainstream machines, most of which use Intel chips. IBM began the dual-core drive in 2001 with its Power4-based servers, while Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard followed suit this year. Dual-core chips are useful, said IDC analyst Jean Bozman. "It's a way for computers to walk and chew gum at the same time," Bozman said. That's particularly important in servers, which by their nature are trying to serve up many applications at the same time. special coverage Intel Developer Forum 2004 Dual-core chips are a highlight of the three-day gathering. For all stories from the event, plus video, click here. And Montecito could help convert some Itanium holdouts. "Having Montecito will be another powerful incentive for customers that have been holding off," Bozman said. However, Otellini did not show a dual-core Xeon chip. He declined to detail when Intel would demonstrate such a chip and bristled at the assertion that rival Advanced Micro Devices, which showed off a dual-core Opteron chip last week, has the lead in technology development. "This is not a race. This is a sea change in computing, and we ought not to look at this as a race," Otellini said during a post-keynote question-and-answer session. Still, the first demonstration of a dual-core Xeon would be considered important as its design will likely also mirror that of Intel's dual-core desktop chips. Intel's dual-core Xeon plans were keenly scrutinized. "It sounds to me like they're terrified of saying something definitive and then having to backtrack, which implies that there's still some fluidity in their road maps," said Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff. "They just sat back and let AMD make its 'first with dual-core' claims without rebuttal." Looking at Vanderpool Vanderpool will allow PCs to do even more by simultaneously splitting one PC into multiple partitions, each of which can have a different purpose. One partition could be scanning for viruses, while another runs a person's applications, such as word processing or computer games. Eye on multicore computing and WiMaxPaul Otellini, president, Intel Vanderpool will be a way for Intel to encourage companies to buy new PCs, Otellini said: "By putting virtualization and reliability and security into the platform, it can accelerate corporate replacement cycles because it is (offering) a better, cheaper environment," he said. Otellini demonstrated one PC using Vanderpool to run office applications, games and voice over Internet Protocol, a computer-aided design application running on Linux and also a virus scanner. Intel cautioned that Vanderpool, as well as a set of security technologies known as LeGrande, won't come until Microsoft ships the next version of Windows, code-named Longhorn, in 2006. As for the digital home, Otellini used his speech to talk up a proposed standard for sending protected content over traditional IP networks. He noted that Microsoft has issued a statement saying it will support the technology, known as DTCP-IP (Digital Transmission Content Protection over Internet Protocol) in future Windows Media products. Intel said it is working to get Apple Computer on board as well. "Maybe you can get them to help get a better name for it," Otellini quipped. Intel also confirmed that it had hired Eric Kim, a Samsung Electronics executive, to head up corporate marketing for Intel. "We don't recruit from the outside very often," Otellini said to reporters. "We were trying to get someone who has not just a technical backgronnd but also a background in consumer electronics." The chipmaker's series of recent product delays and its overenthusiastic expectations for the third quarter also made their presence felt at the show. "We had some fumbles," he said while talking with reporters after the speech. To address the issues, he said, "we went back to the basics." For example, Intel reinstituted its traditional requirement for 90 percent confidence in its ability to meet its schedules and re-evaluated design programs so that it uses consistent standards for conservatism or aggressiveness, he said. Wireless and more But Intel isn't only looking to big leaps in technology to make its products more attractive. The chipmaker will beef up product platforms such as Centrino with things as simple as new ways of connecting with other computers to share data. The chipmaker plans to make WiMax, the wireless broadband technology, an option in its Centrino platform, for one. Intel has already begun sampling the chip, code-named Rosedale and based on the 802.16-2004 standard, to its key customers. It's expected to ship the chip in volume late this year or early in 2005. "Starting in 2006, we have made a commitment we will integrate as an option WiMax silicon into the Centrino notebook platform," Otellini said. By later in 2006 or 2007, adding the highly anticipated WiMax to a computer will mean only a small increase in component costs, a cost that's comparable to that of Wi-Fi today, Otellini said. Otellini on Tuesday also unveiled an initiative, the Intel Cross Platform Manageability Program, designed to help create ways for companies to better administer to computer hardware, ranging from cellular phones and notebooks to servers. Intel plans to offer a Pentium 4 processor with 2MB of performance-enhancing cache by the end of this year, Otellini said. Right now, most Pentium 4s have 1MB. NASA representatives also were on hand to tout Itanium. The U.S. space agency is building a 10,240-Itanium supercomputer from Silicon Graphics Inc., called Project Columbia, that's expected to have performance of 60 trillion calculations per second, or 60 teraflops, when it's complete by the end of the 2004. By contrast, the fastest supercomputer today is NEC's Earth Simulator at 35.8 teraflops. CNET News.com's John Spooner contributed to this report.
2004-02-18 - For Intel 3264-bit chips a long time coming    SAN FRANCISCO--For years, Intel downplayed its interest in chips that could read both 32-bit and 64-bit software. Still, over the course of the last decade, the company was tinkering with the technology. Intel has been debating how to develop such chips since the early 1990s, Intel Chief Technology Officer Pat Gelsinger said in an interview at the Intel Developer Forum taking place here this week. It was only in "1999 or 2000," he said, that the chipmaker began working in earnest on the 32/64-bit processors that now are set to appear in server chips in the second quarter of this year. Meanwhile, it brought to market a pure 64-bit chip, the Itanium, designed for the high end of the server market. The Itanium chip, however, required its own software and operating system. The newer chips are designed for more general-purpose servers and, ostensibly, can run current software while waiting for developers to create new, 64-bit software for them. Late 1999, of course, is when rival Advanced Micro Devices announced at the Microprocessor Forum that it had blueprints for making a 32/64-bit chip. Originally, AMD said the chip--now known as Opteron--would debut in 2001, but it eventually came out in 2003. Intel CEO Craig Barrett said Tuesday that Intel plans to come out with server chips that can run both types of software by the second quarter. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. That development comes after years of the bellwether microprocessor company's having pooh-poohed these sorts of hybrid chips. Last year at the conference, senior researchers highlighted the difficulty of developing such chips and bringing them to market. Intel's disclaimers aside, AMD's 32/64-bit chips seem to have caught on with manufacturers such as IBM and Sun Microsystems. Pentium chips and other desktop PC processors generally run 32-bit software. Chips like the Itanium and Sun's UltraSparc run 64-bit applications. Although 64-bit chips typically run at slower clock speeds, they can pull data from a larger pool of memory and therefore provide greater performance. Software, however, has to be specially written for these 64-bit chips. Both Intel's and AMD's 32/64-bit processors would handle either type of software. Gelsinger's comments echoed those of former and current Intel employees about the internal debates at Intel in the early 1990s about whether the company should enhance its 32-bit line for 64-bit computing or make chips based around the then-evolving Itanium architecture.
2011-11-22 - For HP a tough road ahead  Hewlett-Packards fourth quarter showed that the company has stabilized, but the outlook for 2012 indicates that there are multiple landmines ahead. In fact, the longer HP CEO Meg Whitman and CFO Cathie Lesjak spoke on an earnings conference call yesterday, the more it became obvious that revenue growth may be a mere memory for the next few years. Whitman said HP was delivering an outlook for earnings, but not revenue. She added that HP will have to grow organically too. There wont be any bold acquisitions to save the day. Add it up and there are no quick fixes for HP. Instead, HP has a bevy of landmines to navigate and oddly enough the PC unit isnt one of them. Heres a look at five particularly worrisome areas for HP in 2012. HPs mainstay enterprise server, storage and networking unit is starting to sputter. Revenue for the unit was down 4 percent from a year ago and it is seeing the effect of a slower economic environment. This division carried the company in recent quarters. The Itanium business probably isnt coming back. Fourth-quarter sales of HPs business critical systemsthe Itanium-based Integrity server linewere down 23 percent from a year ago. Oracle and HP are dueling in court over Itanium and its impacting sales. Even if HP and Oracle settle, its unlikely customers will flock to Itanium now. Without Itanium, HP has no proprietary processor at the high end of its server lineup. IBM has Power and Oracle has Sparc. HP Services operating profit is falling. HP didnt invest in services and now margins are taking a hit. Whitman said: I think its really important to level set everyone that this is a journey thats going to take some time and I think its more appropriate to think about the services as more of a ... turnaround thats measured, success is measured in years as opposed to quarters. In other words, this chart may look worse before it gets better. Consumers are cutting back on ink. HPs imaging and printing business is a cash cow, but its a much smaller on than it was just a year ago. Imaging and printing revenue for the fourth quarter was $6.32 billion, down from $6.99 billion a year earlier. Earnings from operations was $808 million, down from $1.22 billion. CFO Lesjak said ink revenue fell 14 percent in the fourth quarter and channel inventory remained high. Supplies revenue closely follows economic cycles. Sell out continued to be impacted by softness in consumer demand as a result of continued pressure on unemployment globally and was below our expectations in the quarter, said Lesjak. The research and development pipeline. HP is at least three years away from funding innovation that will fuel the companys growth. Whitman laid out the R&D picture. Whitman said: I think the investments we make in 2012 youll start to see in 2014 and 2015. I wish I could tell you differently but its not true and youre right. We cut out a lot of muscle in R&D at this company and we have to invest back in it and so its a long term play. We are now building HP; were building it to last. We arent building it for next month or next quarter. We are building this Company to be great over the next decade. Youll see improvements every single year. Youll be able to measure us on how were doing but were making long term bets here because we just cant continue to run this company for the short-term. The problem for HP is that it competes in a space where IBM invests heavily in R&D every year with 6 percent of revenue. Even Dell is increasing its R&D spending. For fiscal 2011, HP spent 2.5 percent of its revenue in R&D. This story originally appeared at ZDNet's Between the Lines under the headline "HP: Five landmines ahead for 2012."
2009-12-15 - Five big business techs of the decade  I've been an IT industry analyst for almost 10 years. I've seen many technologies come, go, or fail to even arrive in the first place. However, during that time, a few techs have emerged that play a big part in fundamentally defining how businesses do computing. Most first emerged prior to 2000, but it has been during the past decade that they've truly changed things. 1. x86 processors were already well entrenched in corporate computing by the end of the 1990s, especially in their role as the "(In)tel" part of "Wintel" servers running Windows NT. However, their dominant designer and manufacturer, Intel, was heading in a different direction to handle the inevitable transition to the 64-bit processors and operating systems needed to keep pace with growing memory requirements. That new direction was Itanium, a clean sheet processor design by Intel and Hewlett-Packard intended to get away from all the legacy features of x86 and--not incidentally--cut the x86-compatible processor makers out of the picture. The Itanium family remains with us but primarily as a processor for high-end HP servers. It was AMD that first added 64-bit extensions to x86 but Intel felt compelled to follow. And it was this backwardly compatible version of x86 that is the mainstream 64-bit server processor, not Itanium. 2. The other big processor story of the decade is multicore. Near the end of 2000, Intel introduced the Pentium 4 processor based on the NetBurst microarchitecture. It was intended to eventually hit about 10GHz. In fact, it never got beyond 4GHz and came to be viewed as the last gasp of performance scaling through frequency. AMD introduced its first multicore x86 Opteron processors for servers in 2005 which helped it gain market share for a time while Intel made major changes to its development plans and processes. IBM and Sun also aggressively pursued multi-core in their RISC lines. Specialty processors such as Azul's Vega and Tilera's TILE lines went even more radically multicore. In short, frequency is largely dead as a path to higher system performance, which will require a combination of more cores and specialty accelerators working in parallel. 3. When I first met Diane Greene, co-founder and then-CEO of VMware in the fall of 2000, VMware was already selling a product to developers that let them run multiple operating systems on a single workstation. But Diane was in town to pitch me on something new, a pair of new server virtualization products--GSX and ESX Server--that made it possible to consolidate multiple workloads on a single physical server and to provision them more quickly. The basic concept goes all the way back to IBM's involvement with early developments in time-shared computing in Cambridge, Mass., during the early '60s. And all the RISC/Unix vendors of the time had their own approaches to slicing and dicing servers. However, it was VMware that brought server virtualization to the masses. Its product ran on standard x86 servers and it provided a way to consolidate workloads right at a time when IT purchases were dramatically slowing and anything that could save money was in vogue. EMC bought VMware in 2003 for $635 million, a figure which it's hard to believe today was widely viewed as an overpayment. Today, server virtualization--an area where VMware remains the 800-lb. gorilla despite Microsoft's entry--continues to fundamentally change the way IT departments think about operating their data centers. Virtualization also underpins much of cloud computing, another major developing trend. 4. Linux and other open source were a big part of the dot-com and service provider build-out of the late 1990s. But enterprises? Not so much. This 2001 research note had to argue that Linux was, in fact, ready for serious production use. And, whether "ready for the enterprise" is a meaningful question in the abstract, the fact remains that the Linux 2.4 kernel was widely regarded as the first version deserving of that description and it wasn't released until mid-2000. IBM began its big Linux push at about the same time. Thus, I'd argue that it's been this past decade and not the prior one that has seen Linux and open source truly become a pervasive part of computing. That's not to say that open-source has replaced all other software. But it has heavily influenced how companies do development, engage with user and developer communities, and provide access to their products--even when the software in question is proprietary. 5. My last entry has the greatest overlap with the consumer space. That's not a coincidence, given that mobile devices are a very visible example of what Citrix CEO Mark Templeton calls the "comsumerization of IT." Mobile devices encompass at least a couple of different things. The most obvious entrant is probably the smartphone--first in the guise of the BlackBerry and more recently the iPhone. We are now at the point where you can carry a bona-fide computer in your pocket, complete with GPS and other sensors, and can run applications that you install. As my colleague Jonathan Eunice has noted, it really is a transformational experience relative to, say, my older Treo. It also represents the reality of the modern smartphone that, for many, it's increasingly about mail, texting, and social media and not, you know, phoning. However, the smartphone doesn't deserve all the limelight. The noughts have also seen the laptop computer transform. I'm not talking about the form factor so much--although Netbooks have gotten their share of attention. Rather I'm talking about the way that we can use them. I've had laptops since the 1990s but it wasn't until about 2001 that conferences and other venues started to put up Wi-Fi networks. They worked fitfully (some things haven't changed as much as we might like), but this was the beginning of the connected laptop rather than the merely mobile laptop. And that's why I see the smartphone and the laptop as part of the same mega-trend. It's not about a particular form factor or usage model. It's about (almost) always being connected to applications that increasingly live largely in the network.
2004-04-30 - First IBM Power5 server to debut Monday    IBM will announce on Monday its first server models using the company's new Power5 processor, along with a new branding strategy that highlights the blurring lines between Big Blue's four current server lines, sources said. IBM's Power5 chip is a 64-bit processor that competes with high-end chips from Intel, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard. Its introduction begins the last step in the convergence of two IBM server lines, iSeries and pSeries, which now use identical hardware and are differentiated only by the operating system and other software. IBM on Monday will introduce its first Power5-based iSeries models, the i5 520, with one or two processors, and the i5 570, with one to four processors, sources said. The new systems will bring lower prices to the iSeries lineage--with one 520 model, which will include versions of IBM's WebSphere e-commerce software and its DB2 database, costing $11,500. "It's a declaration of war against Intel, Dell, Microsoft and Oracle under cover of a value announcement for customers," said RedMonk analyst James Governor. It's a war IBM can fight effectively because it can supply all the necessary hardware and software to compete directly with those rivals, he said. It's only the opening salvo in the Power5-based "Squadron" server launch, however. Later models will accommodate as many as 64 processors, with each processor able to execute simultaneously two instruction sequences called "threads." IBM declined to comment for this story. The iSeries line is a lower-profile member of IBM's server family. It's designed to appeal to customers who want a system with lots of software already built in--not just IBM's WebSphere and DB2 but also third-party packages from companies such as SAP. Though some have expected IBM to eliminate the iSeries line the way HP is phasing out its HP3000 equivalent, Big Blue has strived to keep iSeries relevant--for example by adding the ability to run Linux and that operating system's software. And sharing hardware with the pSeries successor will make it still less isolated, since a single machine will be able to run Linux and either family's operating system simultaneously in separate partitions. Power5 has better partition abilities than Power4, with each chip able to run as many as 10 separate operating systems instead of just one. That feature is handy for companies that want to consolidate several standalone machines that spend much of their time idling into a single server that's more efficiently used. Competitors aren't idling, though, and have servers with partitioning capabilities of their own. Sun, after losing server market share to IBM, is trying to regain it with new servers based on its UltraSparc IV and its Solaris version of Unix. And HP is in league with Intel to push the Itanium processor for its servers, which can run Linux and Windows as well as the HP-UX version of Unix. Brand-name changes In 2000, IBM stamped the eServer brand on the entire server line, with four subbrands: the top-end zSeries mainframes, the pSeries Unix servers, the iSeries midrange servers and the xSeries Intel-based servers. The eServer brand has begun taking on more importance with the arrival of IBM's BladeCenter products, which feature a chassis that can accept thin "blade" servers from multiple server families, and with the arrival of the e325, whose Opteron processor from Advanced Micro Devices excludes it from the xSeries-Intel umbrella. Starting Monday, the eServer brand will move one step closer to the front of the stage. The iSeries label that replaced AS/400 in 2000 will itself be phased out in favor of eServer i5, sources said. And though the OS/400 label for the operating system survived the 2000 rebranding, it now will be replaced with i5/OS, sources said. IBM is expected to retire the pSeries brand in favor of eServer p5 once the Power5-based models start arriving, sources said. Dropping brand names isn't a change to be made lightly, but IBM's name changes aren't just skin deep. Among examples of unification in IBM's server group: processor teams have been combined, the zSeries shares some hardware with the current pSeries and iSeries products, and software including DB2, WebSphere, Linux and the Tivoli management software spans the server product range. And Power5 is the foundation not just of the i5 and p5 lines but also of a new top-end storage system, IBM executives have said. New models The first i5 520 and 570 products will be generally available June 11, sources said. Then, in the third quarter, IBM is expected to introduce a new midrange model for cost-conscious buyers, the i5 550, with as many as four processors. Also at that time, the stacking of four-processor modules used in the i5 570 will extend that system to a 16-processor size. For a given amount of performance, the i5 520 will cost about 30 percent less than its predecessor, the iSeries 820, sources said. And upgrades will cost customers less--with memory prices dropping 60 percent to 80 percent and disk storage prices dropping 20 percent to 30 percent. "Don't get into a price war with IBM right now. It's like getting into a land war in Asia," Governor said. IBM is better able than competitors to support cost cuts in one area with thicker profit margin elsewhere. "Every time they ship an Intel box, they have to give Intel money. With this one, there's no margin to pay anyone else. With this, IBM is in complete control of its own margins; it is beholden to no one." The new operating system, i5/OS version V5R3, won't just run on the new models. It also will work with all iSeries and many AS/400 models, sources said. The new servers incorporate technology called Hypervisor, lower-level software and hardware drawn from the mainframe line that handles tasks such as allocating memory and network resources to different partitions. Accompanying Hypervisor is interdomain networking, in which one partition on a server can communicate with another at much faster speeds than with an ordinary Ethernet network. Like its predecessors, the i5 line also comes with technology called Integrated xSeries Server (IXS) that tightly binds an Intel-based server that can share the main server's networking resources. With i5, though, IXS technology now supports Linux as well as Microsoft Windows, a source said.
2002-11-18 - Firms tout Apache support for AMD chip LAS VEGAS--Red Hat and Covalent Technologies are developing important Internet software, the Apache Web server, for AMD's coming 64-bit Opteron processor, the open-source companies said Monday. The move will be an important step in making a full complement of software available for the new chip, which is due to arrive in the first half of 2003 and will compete with Intel's Itanium and Xeon products. The companies announced the move at the ApacheCon conference in Las Vegas, taking place a few hotels away from the Comdex trade show. Opteron is an extension of the common 32-bit processor architecture, the basis of chips such as AMD's Athlon and Intel's Pentium. Opteron, though, will come with 64-bit abilities, enabling it to address larger amounts of memory. Intel believes extensions to the 32-bit family won't be good enough to last for the next decade and more of chip developments. It's pushing an entirely different architecture for 64-bit chips: Itanium. In order for AMD's Opteron processor to be relevant, enough compatible software must be available. The chip does have the benefit of being able to rely on the existing array of 32-bit programs, but AMD has been funding a version of the Linux operating system for Opteron, and running Web sites powered by the Apache Web server is one of the most popular server jobs to run with Linux. Red Hat is the dominant seller of the Linux operating system. Covalent Technologies sells enhancements to Apache and employs several of the software project's key customers. "Apache is a very widely used Linux-based enterprise Web server application," Marty Seyer, vice president of AMD's server business, said in a statement Monday, "and we are working with two leaders--Covalent and Red Hat--to offer simultaneous high-performance 32- and 64-bit computing to our customers." But SuSE, the second-ranked Linux developer and the company that did much of the work creating an Opteron version of Linux, wasn't impressed with the announcement. Holger Dyroff, general manager of SuSE-Americas, said his company already has finished a 64-bit Opteron version of Apache and Linux. "We have an Apache 64-bit today," he said in an interview. Indeed, the company's Opteron version of Linux is finished and only awaits the release of the chip. Nearby at Comdex, Microsoft demonstrated a prototype of its Windows .Net Server 2003 running on Opteron. In an interview Monday, Bob O'Brien, group product manager of the Windows .Net Server division, declined to say when the Opteron version would be shipped.
2006-08-03 - Firing up IBM's Unix business  All the growth in the server market is with Microsoft Windows and Linux, so why did IBM bother introducing gargantuan 32-processor Unix servers last week? Because there's money to be made, according to Ross Mauri, who took over as general manager of IBM's System p business in January. Unix servers are powerful, often expensive systems used at the heart of customer computing operations. They're on the frontlines of IBM's battle with Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems. Mauri, 47, is a technologist who spent years in Big Blue's mainframe group and who led overall server development before taking over the Unix group. It's a nice fit: Brawny Unix servers are a good home for the reliability, efficiency and performance features originally developed for mainframes, and now being spread to other IBM server families. Mauri took over the Unix server group just as IBM completed a years-long climb to the top of the Unix server market in 2005. But the company's Unix share slipped in early 2006. The Unix chief is confident he can reawaken customers' appetite for spending on high-end IBM systems by bringing the Power5+ processor to the flagship p5-590 and p5-595 servers. He discussed IBM's views on technology and competition with CNET News.com. Q: The overall Unix server market is pretty much flat or shrinking. Why devote a lot of attention to it? Mauri: It's been flat or slightly declining for a decade now, but it's a big, important market. Given the amount of work and applications across many, many different industry segments, we see it as a great land of opportunity. We're going to continue to attack it vigorously, so it's worth the investment. Power6 Systems are scheduled to appear next year, so I presume the Power6 chips themselves are probably pretty well along. What state are they in? Mauri: So far, it looks pretty good. They are up and running in our lab, running at (expected) frequency. We're very pleased with what we see so far, with good yield (the percentage of manufactured processors that are usable). There is still a lot of system-level testing that needs to go on, with the complexity of today's systems. Energy consumption clearly is on the minds of our customers in the marketplace right now--rightfully so. IBM has said Power6 will run at least at a 4GHz clock speed. Is that still the plan? Mauri: Yeah, 4 to 5GHz for sure. Have you changed your designs or your direction with the current ruckus about performance per watt? Mauri: Energy consumption clearly is on the minds of our customers in the marketplace right now--rightfully so. We've got some pretty interesting things that we've been in working on to have more power-efficient management of the overall systems architecture. You'll see us continue to be sure that we've got the best wattage count for the workload done. And we'll start to do some interesting things with how we manage the power overall, so customers can decide about how they want to manage the overall power usage in their data center. Something that would monitor power consumption and performance and give customers a dial so they can ratchet power down when necessary? Mauri: Yeah, absolutely, including tying it to some policy that they might set--whether it's time of day or time of month, if there was particular heavy demand that they knew of, or just reacting in real time. Sun managed to turn things around a little bit recently and gain some market share at IBM's expense, and I noted also during their second quarter of 2006, Sun sold $100 million worth of their UltraSparc T1 "Niagara"-based servers. Do you see Sun as a resurgent threat? Mauri: After 10 straight quarters of decline, I guess their compare (comparison with year-earlier results) has got easy enough that they were going to bounce back a little bit. I have seen what they have done with their Niagara Servers and their Galaxy Servers, but I think they are still struggling. They did make some of those Niagara sales in their installed base. So their market share gain was just a blip, and they're still destined for doom? Mauri: I would like to think so. This market ebbs and flows. If you look at our performance for the last five years, we've had a slight slowdown when we're doing product refreshes, like we were this year with the high-end transitioning to Power5+. In those times, Sun has done a little bit better. I think that you're going to see us come on strong with this new set of products. Intel has announced Montecito, its latest Itanium processor, and the chip will be showing up in systems in the next month or two. What's your assessment of how Intel has been doing with that processor and how Hewlett-Packard has been doing with its Itanium-based Integrity line? Mauri: We're doing pretty well at beating them head-to-head. With their refreshed products that will come in the September or October time frame, I'm sure they will get some PR out of it. But frankly, I think that our technology and our performance leadership are going to prevail here. I think that Itanium is a bit of an anchor for HP, with their PA-RISC base and their Alpha base (two processor lines that are being discontinued) of customers being forced to transition. With Niagara, Sun has aggressively pushed performance-per-watt and multicore processors that run lots of instruction threads. IBM has chosen with Power to use many fewer cores and many fewer threads. Do you think that Sun's strategy has any merit or are you confident that heavy cores are the way to go? Mauri: Multicore is something that we pioneered, and you'll continue to see us make great strides in that area. We've also had multithreaded systems for a long time. I'm really comfortable that we've got a winning strategy. I don't expect some big switch from IBM's point of view surrounding this. Power6 is another dual-core processor, correct? Mauri: Yes, Power6 will be dual-core. And do you think you will go quad-core with Power7? Mauri: We're looking at higher levels of cores for chips, as we demonstrated in the Cell processor. That's clearly demonstrating multiple cores and being able to run a high amount of workload. One interesting change you made with the Power-based systems in recent years was the addition of Linux as an operating system. What are your long-term ambitions for Linux--versus your version of Unix, AIX--on Power? Mauri: That's good question. People have been asking us that for since 2000, when we started really talking about our Linux strategy. We want Linux to have a great home on the Power architecture. We will continue to contribute to the open-source development of Linux, as well as all of the packages that surround Linux, to ensure it performs well on Power. But as we have said, AIX is our flagship on System p. We've invested a lot in it. Nothing scales as well as AIX. Nothing is robust as AIX. It leverages all of our virtualization technologies and, quite frankly, most of our customers worldwide have bet their business on it. We're going to continue to invest in AIX and continue to enhance it. So is Linux a red-headed stepchild? If AIX is the flagship and the priority, why should customers mess with Linux on Power? Mauri: Linux on Power can be used in conjunction with AIX, running virtually next to one another on a single box. So for consolidation, you (can) bring in some Linux workload. Sometimes, customers are consolidating and taking out Sun Solaris, and they decide to convert those Solaris workloads over to Linux. We're also seeing Linux very healthy and happy running on Power in some standalone applications where the customers decided that Linux was good enough--for instance, some of the things we've been doing recently with Sybase and their IQ product. We're going to treat them both properly and support them both. There doesn't have to be an absolute, one or the other. The customers that want both, and we see good return on investing in both. Do you ever consider open-sourcing AIX the way Sun is open-sourcing Solaris? Mauri: No, we're not. I think that OpenSolaris is a little bit of a game Sun is playing to try to get good PR. But I don't think it's in the spirit of true open source. We have been very happy to get directly involved and contribute to Linux and Apache and the Eclipse Foundation. We're not going to open-source AIX. It's best run on the current model, where we have the expertise. We enhance it. We work closely with our customers to listen to their requirements. But in the end, it's best that we control that source code.
2000-08-24 - Fiorina to unleash HP's latest weapon in server wars   Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina will unveil the first incarnation of the company's new high-end "Superdome" Unix server in New York on Sept. 12, sources said. HP will unveil the systems gradually, sources familiar with the strategy said. Fiorina will launch the first, using 32 processors, they said. A 64-processor model will arrive later this year, Duane Zitzner, head of HP's hardware division, told News.com in a July interview. Superdome is the flagship of HP's effort to regain its strength in the Unix server market, which Sun Microsystems dominates and which IBM is aggressively courting. The market also has seen the arrival of major new server designs with Compaq Computer's Wildfire systems and SGI's Origin 3000 series. HP representatives declined to comment beyond saying the computer maker planned to launch the servers in the middle of September along with several services. They added that Superdome machines will help in HP's effort to target Sun. HP's Unix server business had been on the rebound earlier this year, but weak sales last quarter sent HP's stock down. Unix servers are increasingly popular, partly because of the general increase in demand for servers spurred by the Internet, but also because Unix servers using 64-bit CPUs are able to address large amounts of memory and therefore use large databases. Though Intel currently doesn't have any 64-bit chips, the arrival of Itanium-based servers next year will change that, and Intel hopes its standard servers will sell better than custom designs from Compaq, IBM, HP, SGI and Sun. HP, the company that initially developed the design for Itanium and later members of Intel's IA-64 family, has been selling Unix servers that will work with either IA-64 chips or HP's own PA-RISC design. The N-class Unix server, a machine that uses up to eight processors and was unveiled last year, was the first designed to use either chip. HP later introduced lower-end A-class and L-class servers with the same design. Superdome will continue this trend, replacing the V-class machine that can use only PA-RISC chips. Sun can't seem to build enough of its high-end E10000 servers, despite the aging design and the arrival in 2001 of its replacement, code-named Serengeti. In the last quarter, Sun sold 500 of its E10000s, a fifth of the total sold over the several-year history of the product, which originally was designed by Cray. IBM argues that its S80 Unix servers are faster than the E10000, but analysts point to other elements of customer choice besides raw performance, including support or software availability. IBM's S80s, which use 24 of IBM's Power chips to the 64 in Sun's E10000, are less expensive, generally costing less than $1 million where E10000s cost more than $1 million. IBM is readying a successor, code-named Regatta, that will use 32 processors. Sources expect the Superdome machines to generally cost more than $1 million. Using a high-speed connection technology, 64-processor Superdome machines will be able to be grouped into foursomes with 256 processors, Zitzner said. HP this year upgraded its version of Unix, called HP-UX, so it can communicate with as many as 256 CPUs. Sun's servers enjoy "strong market momentum," Meta Group analyst Brian Richardson said in an Aug. 11 report, but IBM and HP currently offer more bang for the buck. "Our research indicates growing unease at Sun accounts. Unlike the competitive landscape just two years ago, the performance of Sun's systems is being overshadowed by more competitive offerings from IBM and Hewlett-Packard," he said. Though the upgrade to the Serengeti systems and the UltraSparc III CPU will offer doubled or tripled performance, "UltraSparc III is at least nine months late," he said. Unix servers in general, however, still will outnumber Windows NT servers for high-end jobs through 2003 or 2004, Richardson said. SGI's new Origin 3000 series servers are respected, though the financially unsteady company is focusing on niche markets much smaller than the broader marketing salvos unleashed by IBM, Compaq, Sun and HP. SGI sold two 512-processor Origin 3800 systems to NASA, which will combine them into a single 1,024-processor behemoth for researching aeronautics, Earth science and biology. SGI also sold a 512-processor Origin 3800 to the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, the company said. The Army Research Lab also bought one 256-processor and one 512-processor model.
2002-11-14 - Fiorina Tight budgets an IT reality    SAN FRANCISCO--Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said Thursday that the current conservative attitude of IT buyers is here to stay. In a keynote speech here at the OracleWorld trade show--her first public appearance since Monday's resignation of HP President Michael Capellas--Fiorina addressed the two-year market retraction that has beaten down the IT industry. Businesses, she said, are making tougher demands on computer and software makers to improve the value, extend the lifespan and lower the cost of their products. "I think this is a permanent set of changes...and it will stay with us even when the economy comes back," Fiorina said. "The next era of IT will not be about the hottest box or the killer app," she added, but about making sure information technology is more flexible to businesses' needs. In response to these changes, HP is focusing on making its server, storage, network management and consumer products more "modular" in their architecture, so businesses can more easily pick and choose what they need. The company is also designing its offerings around industry, rather than proprietary, standards, she said. And better security, reliability and interoperability are priorities. But Fiorina stressed that despite the current economic malaise and the permanent shift to frugality the downturn has brought on, the need for IT among businesses isn't going away. "The smart application of technology distinguishes the winners from the losers," Fiorina said. Another development driving the future of the IT industry is the move to so-called utility-based computing, Fiorina said. In that model, companies leave all their computing needs to a third party rather than making huge investments in their own private IT infrastructure. The companies then pay monthly bills for what they use, in the same way they pay for utilities such as electricity or water. Wind in Larry's sails Fiorina also highlighted her company's 20-year partnership with Oracle, with whom HP shares some 80,000 customers. The two companies discussed plans this week to bundle Oracle middleware software on HP servers. Both companies, she said, share a common commitment to designing products for the Linux operating system and Intel's new Itanium 2 chip. Oracle, a leading maker of database and other business software, said it drew a crowd of 23,000 IT specialists to its annual OracleWorld convention here this week. Fiorina's keynote was one of a number of speeches delivered by some of the IT industry's top guns. Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell Computer, Paul Otellini, president of Intel, and Michael Ruettger, chairman of EMC, also made appearances earlier in the week. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison later Thursday plans to address the audience via satellite from New Zealand, where he's competing for the America's Cup. Ellison's team, Oracle BMW Racing, has won each of its last nine races in the premier international sailing competition, placing the team in the Louis Vuitton Cup quarter-finals, Fiorina announced during her keynote. HP provided the team with much of its computer equipment for the competition, including laptop computers, Fiorina said. "HP puts the wind in Larry's sails," Fiorina quipped. "If Larry Ellison and his team don't win, it's not because of the technology, it's because of the captain." Fiorina has her own leadership issues to grapple with. This week Capellas vacated the No. 2 spot at HP, and the company has no plans to hire a new president. Analysts expressed concern that Fiorina may be taking on too much. Fiorina didn't mention Capellas' departure or whether it would impact HP during her speech.
2005-05-25 - Final step next week for HP's Itanium makeover Hewlett-Packard is expected to announce a new line of NonStop servers next week, the final step in its plan to converge all its high-end server lines onto the Itanium processor, CNET News.com has learned. The NonStop servers are high-end machines used for demanding tasks such as those required by the Nasdaq stock exchange. The machines today use Silicon Graphics' MIPS processors, making them something of an outcast in HP's product lines, but moving to Itanium likely will boost performance and reduce prices. The first Itanium-based NonStop models are expected to be generally available in June and will use the current "Madison" version of the processor, sources familiar with the situation said. HP will announce the servers June 1, according to another source familiar with the company's plans. News.context What's new: Hewlett-Packard is expected to announce a new line of NonStop servers next week, the final step in its plan to converge all its high-end server lines onto the Itanium processor.Bottom line: The completion of HP's years-long plan to move NonStop to Itanium could help make the servers more competitive. It also could help HP cut development expenses during a time when its server group is under fierce profitability pressure. More stories on NonStop Itanium, a chip family HP helped Intel develop, fell well short of early expectations, but it's a more mainstream hardware and software foundation than MIPS. As a result, HP's years-long plan to move NonStop to Itanium likely will help make the servers more competitive, said Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice. "I think that will fix a lot of the historical price and price-performance bugaboos," Eunice said. "NonStop will never be cheap--but at least it won't be wholly out of line with the rest of the world." HP declined to comment for this report. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based printer and computer maker expects a major performance boost out of the Itanium systems. The top-end MIPS-based S88000 introduced in 2004 has about 1.3 times the performance of its predecessor S86000, but HP believes the first Itanium systems will have as much as 2.6 times that performance, according to an HP presentation seen by CNET News.com. And future versions will doubtless be faster. A second-generation Itanium NonStop model is scheduled to debut in late 2006 using Intel's "Montecito" version of Itanium, which employs dual processing cores and which is due to arrive at the end of 2005, the presentation said. And a system with Montecito's "Montvale" successor is scheduled for the second half of 2008. Further Itanium NonStop sequels are scheduled for late 2009 and early 2011, the presentation said. The new line is expected to pick up not just the Itanium processor but also the Integrity brand name that's used for HP's mainstream Itanium servers. It's expected to be called the Integrity NonStop NS-series. Another component making its way from the mainstream Integrity line to NonStop is the zx1 chipset to link processors to each other, to memory and to all other computing subsystems. The NonStop machines are the most powerful HP sells. That's because software runs on top of a tightly linked network of numerous smaller machines that collectively make up a NonStop. In addition, processors are linked in pairs that run in lockstep so processing errors can be caught quickly. "NonStop is in there with (NCR's) Teradata and (IBM's) zSeries as folks who've scaled the tallest peaks, and routinely do so with aplomb," Eunice said. NonStop customers include Sabre Holdings, Barclaycard, Travelocity and Vodafone. Processor whiplash The move to Itanium hasn't been easy, however. The NonStop line has endured some processor hairpin turns in recent years. An initial plan to move from MIPS to Itanium was changed to feature the Alpha processor after Compaq Computer acquired Tandem. Then Compaq decided to cancel the Alpha in 2001, and HP acquired Compaq and engineers dusted off the Itanium plan. And now the Itanium NonStop systems are arriving a few months late. When HP finalized its Compaq acquisition in 2002, it said it planned to release the systems in 2004. Then there's the fact that delays and software barriers meant Itanium didn't live up to the early hopes of HP and Intel. The companies expected Itanium to dominate the server market, but the chip missed Intel shipment goals, and both companies now position it just for the high-end server segment. Itanium is faring better than SGI's MIPS, though, and there's no question that the chip is permitting HP to gradually simplify its complicated processor foundation. The last new Alpha processor, the EV7z, has been released. The OpenVMS operating system that most often runs on Alpha-based machines today now can run on Itanium, too. And the PA-8900 processor--the final member of HP's PA-RISC processor family that powers the HP 9000 line of Unix servers--is imminent. In the future, HP will use just two processor families: Itanium for high-end servers, and x86 chips such as Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron for lower-end systems. The simplification is important for HP as it tries to dramatically cut operating expenses and increase profitability. HP's NonStop Enterprise Division has for years been led by Pauline Nist, a vice president. In May, however, Martin Fink took over the role in addition to his job as leader of the Open Source and Linux Organization. Nist now leads the Total Customer Experience group for HP's Enterprise Server and Storage division.
2005-04-01 - FAQ Forty years of Moore's Law Forty years ago, Electronics magazine asked Intel co-founder Gordon Moore to write an article summarizing the state of the electronics industry. The article outlined what became known as Moore's Law, the observation that the number of transistors--tiny on/off switches that churn out electrical signals that get represented as 1s and 0s--on a chip can be doubled in a short period of time. Adopted as a yardstick by the tech industry, the concept is one of the reasons the industry evolved into a high-growth, but high-risk, affair. This FAQ explains the impact and consequences of the principles set down in the April 19, 1965, article. What is Moore's Law? When writing the article, Moore noted that the number of devices (which then included transistors and resistors) inside chips was doubling every year, largely because engineers could shrink the size of transistors. That meant that the performance and capabilities of semiconductors was growing exponentially and would continue to. In 1975, Moore amended the law to state that the number of transistors doubled about every 24 months. When the paper first came out, chips sported about 60 distinct devices. By contrast, Intel's latest Itanium chip comes with 1.7 billion silicon transistors. As monumental as the article has become, it wasn't a big deal then. It started on page 114 of the magazine. "It wasn't something you expected to join the archives," Moore said in a recent gathering with reporters. "I didn't think it would be especially accurate." Why is it possible? It's the miracle of industrial chemistry. Silicon is a good semiconductor (which means it can conduct electricity, but in a manner that can be controlled), and the crystalline structure remains intact despite shrinkage. Is the law now dead? No, though various analysts and executives have incorrectly predicted its demise. It will, however, likely begin to slow down to a three-year cycle in the next decade and require companies to adopt alternative technologies. Some people, such as Stan Williams and Phil Kuekes of HP Labs, say the ability to shrink transistors will start to become problematic by around 2010. That should prompt manufacturers to adopt alternatives, such as HP's crossbar switches, to control electrical signals. It wasn't something you expected to join the archives. --Gordon Moore, co-founder, Intel Others, such as Intel's director of technology strategy, Paolo Gargini, paint a more gradual picture. Around 2015, they say, manufacturers will start to move toward hybrid chips, which combine elements of traditional transistors with newfangled technology such as nanowires. A full conversion to new types of chips may not occur until the 2020s. From a theoretical point of view, silicon transistors could continue to be shrunk until about the 4-nanometer manufacturing generation, which could appear about 2023. At that point, the source and the drain, which are separated by the transistor gate and gate oxide, will be so close that electrons will drift over on their own. When that happens, transistors will lose their reliability, because it will be impossible to control the flow of electrons and hence the creation of 1s and 0s. (The nanometer measurement refers to the average feature size on a chip. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter. Current chips are made on a 90-nanometer process, while experimental devices about 6 nanometers long have been produced.) What happens then? Hard to say. If alternatives to silicon transistors never materialize, Moore's Law stops. If alternatives emerge, progress could accelerate under similar principles. What's the best alternative? Who knows? Carbon =id="5091267">nanotube transistors, silicon nanowire transistors, molecular crossbars, phase change materials and spintronics are mostly now lab experiments. Silicon, though, won't go easy. Manufacturers and designers love it. Chances are, silicon will continue to be incorporated into these new devices in some fashion. "I view (silicon) technology as a fundamental way for bringing out complex microstructures and materials," Moore said. Who said what? California Institute of Technology Professor Carver Mead was the one who dubbed it Moore's Law, a lofty title Moore said he was too embarrassed to utter himself for about 20 years. David House, a former Intel executive, extrapolated that the doubling of transistors doubles performance every 18 months. Actually, performance doubles more like every 20 months. Moore emphatically says he never said 18 months for anything. The rule also doesn't apply to hard-drive densities or to the growth of other devices. "Moore's Law has come to be applied to anything that changes exponentially, and I am happy to take credit for it," Moore joked. What does doubling do? The impact can be summed up as follows: faster, smaller, cheaper. Under Moore's Law, chip designers essentially shrink the size of transistors--which are now measured in nanometers--and then fill up the resulting empty space on the chip with more transistors. More transistors let designers add features, such as 3D graphics, that used to exist on separate chips--thereby cutting costs. The designers can also choose to dedicate more transistors to speeding up how the chip performs its usual functions. Despite the extra transistors, these enhanced chips cost about the same as the old ones, because they take up the same surface area of silicon. As an added bonus, smaller transistors mean electrons don't have to travel as far, boosting performance. Though chip designs vary widely, manufacturers try to get some or all of these advantages. How does that affect products? Put into practice, Moore's Law spells out a way for companies to enhance their products at a rapid clip. Eighteen years ago, Michael Douglas, in the movie "Wall Street," spoke on a cell phone that was about the size and shape of a brick. Shrinkage and integration has lead to phones with television tuners, 7-megapixel cameras and MP3 players. Declining costs have also put them in the hands of billions of people. More-powerful, cheaper chips have in turn allowed software makers to develop applications such as instant messaging, 3D games and Web browsers that would have been cumbersome only a few years before they were invented. Consumers and analysts regularly complain that progress outstrips their needs, but rarely does anyone revert. What are the technical problems? Getting electricity to transistors is difficult, and dissipating the heat generated by these transistors is just as challenging. Some transistor structures, such as the gate oxide, are only a few atoms thick, so they leak electricity. Where does it go next? The trend now is to put silicon where it isn't. In the coming years, various start-ups hope to embed sensors in walls, household appliances and even wild animals. Microfluidics chips will let doctors quickly harvest large amounts of patient data with less lab equipment. What's the economic impact? Very few industries are this lucky. Car manufacturers have to entice customers with new cup holders or different body types, because engine performance doesn't change that rapidly. Moore noted that if car manufacturers had something like this, cars would get 100,000 miles to the gallon and it would be cheaper to buy a Rolls Royce than park it. (Cars would also be only a half an inch long.) The fear now is that the treadmill will slow. "Replacement has always been predicated on our industry's ability to come up with neat new things to buy. That in turn has been predicated on greater integration, allowing richer features due to the progress of Moore's Law," wrote Dan Hutcheson of VLSI Research in his newsletter "The Chip Insider." "Slow it down, and end users are likely to slow their replacement rate. Slow this, and the market slows with it." Are the economics healthy? Yes and no. One of the unsavory consequences of tracking Moore's Law is called Rock's Law, named after venture capitalist Arthur Rock. It states that the cost of fabrication facilities doubles every four years. Now fabs cost billions of dollars and the cafeterias in them generally cost more than the old fabs, noted Craig Barrett, Intel's CEO. Most chip companies now do not own their own factories because of the costs. Wall Street analysts, conference futurists and even some chip executives have regularly declared that the outrageous expenses will lead to the end or a slowing of Moore's Law. Most companies, though, never take the advice: Falling off the pace would just ensure extermination by faster-moving competitors anyway. The chip industry remains a multibillion-dollar industry. What else did Moore predict? Re-reading the paper after 40 years, Moore noticed that he also predicted the home computer and electronic wristwatches. In the early '70s, in another article for Electronics Magazine, Moore also forecast the growth of Ovonics Unified Memory, a type of memory made from a similar material as CD disks. In February, Intel said it may come out with Ovonics memory in a few years. Not everything he's said, however, has come true. He once predicted that wafers, the round disks out of which chips are harvested, would measure 56 inches in diameter about now. They measure 300 millimeters, or 12 inches.
2001-06-19 - Famed open-source compiler upgraded    The foundation of the open-source movement has just shifted. On Monday, programmers released version 3.0 of GCC, a software project not as well-known as open-source projects such as Linux but one that's key to all of them. GCC is a compiler--the critical software that converts programs written by humans into instructions a chip can understand. GCC is used to create everything from Linux and its various BSD Unix cousins to higher-level software such as the Apache Web server, the Gnome user interface and the Jabber instant-messaging software. And it can run on and create software for more than 40 different chip families. When Eric Allman was working on his open-source Sendmail e-mail server software about a decade ago, GCC was just one of a collection of compilers he had to support to make sure his software could run on a large number of computers. "I was using a lot of compilers, and GCC was one of them," he said. "At this point, GCC is so common you almost could use just GCC." But GCC isn't just for open-source projects--the collaborative efforts in which developers share their programs without the secrecy of the proprietary world. Because the GCC design lets it create programs for dozens of different CPUs, it has been used to create the software for numerous proprietary systems as well. Indeed, GCC has spread as far as Microsoft, which ships the compiler as part of its Interix software, which enables Unix software to run on Windows computers. Version 3.0, under development for more than a year, adds several features. Among them is an improved ability to generate instructions for Intel's mainstream chips--work Intel has been funding for years. The software GCC produces for other chips is also improved. Among the new chips now supported are Intel's Itanium and XScale, Motorola's MCore 210 and 340, Mitsubishi's D30V, Atmel's AVR and Fujitsu's FR30, said Jeff Law, a GCC developer at Red Hat. The new version of GCC is the first major revamp since version 2.0 was released in February 1992. Since then, GCC has survived a problem that many consider to be one of the biggest threats to open-source software: code forking, in which two separate groups of programmers develop in different directions. GCC history GCC originally was a project begun by Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman. Version 1.0 was released in May 1987. GCC once stood for GNU C Compiler, since it was used to compile programs written in the C programming language for Stallman's "GNU's Not Unix" (GNU) effort to create a clone of Unix. Now, though, because GCC accepts programs written in many other languages as well, GCC stands for GNU Compiler Collection. Stallman created the concept of "free software"--which he defines not as no-cost, but as software that may be freely redistributed as long as its source code remains open. He released GCC under the General Public License, the license now used to cover many open-source efforts. Indeed, the Linux kernel that stepped in to become the heart of the GNU operating system project is released under the GPL. Much of GCC's development has been supported by Linux seller Red Hat, after its 1999 acquisition of Cygnus Solutions, a company whose business was adapting GCC so it could support new chips. Cygnus' first customers used GCC for proprietary systems such as network equipment, said Michael Tiemann, founder of Cygnus and now chief technology officer of Red Hat. Nortel was Cygnus' first major customer, in 1990. Intel joined later that year. Ericsson arrived in 1991, and Cisco Systems and Alcatel signed on in 1992, he said. Tiemann was an instrumental early developer of the compiler. He started with version 1.0 in 1987 and added several major new features to GCC, including the ability to run on the National Semiconductor 32032 chip and the ability to accept software written in the C++ language. Tiemann also worked on the translation of GCC to the Motorola 8800, Intel's 386 chips, MIPS chips, and Sun's Sparc chips. He also helped lay the groundwork for "very long instruction word" (VLIW) chips such as Intel's new Itanium. One of the criticisms of GCC is the fact that it is so general-purpose: being able to use it on so many chips with so many languages means it only produces mediocre software. But Tiemann defends GCC. In the process of figuring out how to get GCC to create software for so many different chips, GCC developers discovered improvements that apply to many different chips, Tiemann said. "Having the genetic material that spans across all these architectures in my opinion makes it a better compiler than any specific one," he said. For example, modifying GCC for chips from MIPS and Sun laid the groundwork for future Intel chips that followed those other designs. In addition, GCC has modules that optimize software for particular chips. "There are companies out there that are spending $50 million or $100 million on compiler development, and for a given arch, that may give them a leading position by some percentage," he said. "But in my opinion, the (ability) to support a wide range of microprocessors with a common compiler infrastructure and the ability to more rapidly adapt to microprocessors as they come out gives you better opportunity to take advantage of Moore's Law," the principle that chips double in power every 18 months. Cygnus, which was earning about $20 million in annual revenue at the time Red Hat acquired the company, had much of its success in "embedded" designs such as network routers and other communication equipment. Indeed, Intel's first funding of Cygnus was to create GCC support for Intel's now-defunct i960 communications processor. Now GCC is all over the computing landscape. "It became sort of the default compiler to use because it supports so many machines and so many platforms," Stallman said. "People wanted to be able to use the same compilers everywhere." The code fork While Tiemann was at Cygnus, his company gained powerful influence over GCC. The Free Software Foundation-appointed GCC maintainer, though, didn't have enough time to process all the changes to GCC, and because of disagreements over how to manage these changes, Cygnus decided in 1997 to create a new version of GCC called EGCS. Tiemann said that through EGCS, Cygnus showed it could maintain a heavy influence over GCC without letting its own motives shut out others' priorities. Eventually the rift was healed, in April 1999, when the Free Software Foundation agreed to use the EGCS code for GCC and the EGCS project agreed to dissolve itself and work instead on GCC. "It was a bloodless fork and a bloodless reunification," Tiemann said.
2001-11-12 - Failed HP-Compaq merger would be painful   Shareholders opposed to the proposed marriage of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer should be careful what they wish for: Undoing the $20 billion deal would unleash problems for both companies that could be far more debilitating than those related to the complex combination. Last week, descendents of Hewlett-Packard co-founder William Hewlett announced they would vote against the deal. Walter Hewlett, a member of HP's board as well as chairman of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, said the foundation would vote against the merger. Hewlett offered a laundry list of ills that would result from a merger: Acquiring Compaq would boost HP's exposure to the PC market, which he said is "neither growing nor profitable." He emphasized that the two companies would undertake an unprecedented merger at exactly the time their core markets were deteriorating and the general economy was slipping into a recession. The merger would distract HP's management and prompt customers to shift business to other computer makers, he warned. Hewlett was merely echoing some of the concerns critics have been expressing since HP CEO Carly Fiorina announced the merger in September. But now that naysayers are gaining momentum, an increasingly vocal group of other observers--including HP insiders and a number of financial and legal experts in the Silicon Valley--insist that killing the merger at this point could be equally disastrous. HP and Compaq have likely been privy to key details of each other's business. The independent companies also would face extreme skepticism from Wall Street, which had already been dubious about the companies before the merger. By far the most serious problem, some industry experts say, would be the likely departures of Fiorina, Compaq CEO Michael Capellas, several key board members and dozens of senior executives who have become staunch supporters of the deal. "I don't think Walter (Hewlett) has thought this through," said a source familiar with the HP board. "None of the directors, except Walter, would stay, and I guarantee a lot of the senior management would leave too." "Dark cloud" approaching? It's hard to say exactly what would happen if the HP-Compaq deal were to fall apart; few mergers of this magnitude have ever failed so late in the process. Between January 1999 and April 2001, roughly three out of 25 buyout offers for public companies worth $500 million or more didn't close, according to BusinessWeek. Most deals failed because of early regulatory concerns or because one company backed out shortly after the proposal. In one of the few last-minute bailouts, France's Alcatel and Murray Hill, N.J.-based Lucent Technologies broke off a $34 billion merger that would have resulted in the world's largest telecom-equipment maker. But even in that 11th-hour rejection, the merger never made it to a shareholder vote: Lucent balked in June because it wouldn't have equal representation on the board. Still, the fallout of the failed merger was immediate. Alcatel lost Krish Prabhu, its American chief operating officer and widely considered a successor to 63-year-old CEO Serge Tchuruk. Lucent lost a number of middle and senior executives. Both companies also announced massive layoffs shortly after the deal collapsed. "When it gets scuttled, there's sort of a dark cloud that follows the executives who advocated the deal," said Lindsay Hoover, a vice president in the technology group of investment bank Houlihan Lowkey Howard & Zukin. "There's a lot of second-guessing after a failed deal." The 47-year-old Fiorina, who came to HP from Lucent, faces especially intense scrutiny because she was so widely heralded upon becoming HP's chief executive. Most recently, she was named No. 1 in Fortune magazine's 2001 "Power 50" ranking of powerful women in business--the same placing she's received every year since the list debuted in 1998. She heads the biggest company run by a woman, and she's one of the few outsiders to have become a staple of the Silicon Valley. Many people on Wall Street and in the tech industry believe that Fiorina has staked her career on the merger. If it falls through, she'll leave--as will all ambitious executives who publicly support her. Some speculate that several key board members may also resign. "She came into her current position as CEO as the media's darling," said Robert Eldridge, vice president with Broadview International, a mergers and aquisitions adviser for the technology, communications and media industries. "Now, rightly or wrongly, that position has changed...You'd have to believe the consequences (of a failure to acquire Compaq) would put her under additional pressure to be an above-average manager." If the Compaq deal is killed, it would mark the second significant failure for Fiorina. In an attempt to expand its capability in the consulting arena, HP sought to acquire PricewaterhouseCoopers' consulting business for about $18 billion. Wall Street was unimpressed and the deal was called off last November due to market conditions. Inside intelligence Another major complication of a last-minute bailout: HP and Compaq would each possess key information about the rival's marketing plans--the equivalent of inside intelligence on an archrival. According to sources familiar with the companies' integration team, members are sharing information about pricing and business strategy for product lines that aren't due to hit markets for several years. HP integration team leaders include Webb McKinney, president of HP's corporate sales, and John Brennan, vice president of strategy and corporate development. Compaq's members include CFO Jeff Clarke and strategy czar Claude Pumilia. Team members work full time on integration issues. A central team collects core knowledge from smaller business and function teams. Teams are made up of roughly half HP workers and half Compaq employees, though each team has only one leader--an attempt by both companies to avoid what they call "two-in-a-box governance." The integration team leaders meet every Wednesday and have progress reports with Fiorina and Capellas on Thursday mornings, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They are responsible for "in-depth planning, coordination and creation of deliverables." U.S. antitrust laws forbid companies engaged in merger talks from implementing merger-related business plans before shareholders and antitrust regulators bless the deal. HP and Compaq executives have emphasized that the workers should focus on business plans that preceded the merger announcement until final approval. "As important as the merger is, we have an equally important objective in the short term. That is to deliver a solid performance in Q4," Capellas stated Friday in a letter to employees. "There's nothing we can do today that will say more about our strength and our passion for winning than to exceed our Q4 performance targets." But Compaq spokesman Arch Currid confirmed that not all members of the integration team have signed nondisclosure agreements. If the deal falls through, only those who signed the documents would be legally prohibited from sharing or using the information if they go back to their former posts at HP or Compaq. No team members signed documents requiring them to resign should the merger fall through. That means that both companies could have critical information about the other's pricing and strategy--in some cases for several years out. "In theory, the due diligence won't be disclosed and won't be used for any purpose other than the due diligence or preparations for the merger," said Jeffrey Stewart, a lawyer specializing in technology industry mergers and acquisitions at Atlanta-based Arnall Golden Gregory. "In the practical world, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to set up a Chinese wall that prevents information from being used. There's always slippage." A failed merger would also mean that Compaq would be bereft of a Unix server strategy, a key part of the company's relationships with sales partners and major software companies such as Oracle. In June, less than three months before the merger announcement, Compaq canceled its Alpha chip, the widely respected but not widely used foundation of its Unix server line, in favor the Intel Itanium line codeveloped by HP. Merging would let Compaq lean on HP's Unix server line, which is still under active development and has a less abrupt plan for moving to Itanium. With the acquisition, analysts expect Compaq to fold advanced features of its Tru64 version of Unix into the corresponding HP-UX. With no merger, Compaq would face the daunting prospect of resurrecting a plan to rework it for Itanium that the company canceled two years ago. No backup plans If the merger falls through, the companies would inflict upon themselves a potentially large financial penalty. That, combined with the fact that executives have insisted they have no "Plan B" if the merger falls through, would result in tremendous skepticism from Wall Street. The most obvious pain from a merger collapse would be a direct earnings hit in the form of a fee paid by the party that abandons the deal. Regulatory filings indicate the HP-Compaq merger includes a breakup fee of $675 million--almost 35 cents per share for HP or 40 cents per share for Compaq, based on outstanding share totals of 1.94 billion and 1.69 billion, respectively. On paper, it would seem that HP would be responsible for paying the fee because most of the shareholder opposition is coming from HP's side, but breakup negotiations are never simple. Breakup fees can be especially tricky in deals involving equal or nearly equal partners, as with HP and Compaq. For instance, HP could try to avoid paying a fee by blaming factors in Compaq for creating uncertainty among HP shareholders, Eldridge said. "You're always going to have a dispute over this," Eldridge said. "Is that dispute an afternoon on the phone...or is it a long, drawn-out process? Each situation is different, but I don't think there are very many amicable breakups." Others say Compaq would have an especially tough time on Wall Street if the merger were to fall through. "They did the deal at a low premium, in effect selling their company," said a banker close to the deal. "If the deal doesn't go through, there will be a lot of pressure on those guys. People will say, 'OK, guys, that didn't work. What's next?'" It's still unclear whether Hewlett and other merger opponents will thwart the proposed combination. On Thursday, Hewlett hired prominent proxy solicitation firm MacKenzie Partners, possibly to persuade investors to block the deal--a move that escalates the public relations battle facing Fiorina and other merger advocates as they take their pitch on a Wall Street road show. Also potentially standing in the way of the merger is the European Commission, which earlier this year blocked General Electric's $43 billion acquisition of Honeywell--even though it had been approved in the United States. The commission's chief complaint about the HP-Compaq deal so far is that the merger would allow HP to dominate PC distribution and therefore fix prices for the entire industry. Although few overtly questioned whether the deal would go through when the merger was announced in September, it now appears to be unraveling. Arbitrageurs have flocked to HP and Compaq stocks, eager to make money quickly because of the likelihood of severe, short-term volatility in both stocks until the shareholder vote. Even insiders are starting to question whether it will happen. "When they first announced it, I said the odds of it going through were very high," said an attorney who represents Compaq's financial advisers. "I would think now that it's got less than a 50-50 percent chance of going forward. It's going to be ugly." News.com's Dawn Kawamoto and Stephen Shankland contributed to this report.
2002-01-31 - Europe gives thumbs-up to HP-Compaq    European regulators on Thursday approved the pending mega-merger between Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer, leaving industry watchers to ponder whether U.S. regulators will follow suit. After only about a month of reviewing the matter, the European Commission gave the deal a pat on the back, imposing no conditions and saying that neither competitors nor consumers would be harmed. "A careful analysis of the merger, the largest ever in the information-technology sector, and of the competitive forces in the markets concerned has shown that HP would not be in a position to increase prices and that consumers would continue to benefit from sufficient choice and innovation," the EC stated. In the PC market, European regulators found that the merged company would still face strong competition from such rivals as IBM, Dell Computer and Fujitsu-Siemens. "With the absence of significant barriers to entry and the practice of non-exclusive contractual relationships between retailers and manufacturers, (this) would prevent the new HP from any attempt to raise prices significantly," the EC said. With this latest decision, the European Commission has tempered its growing reputation for taking a tougher stance than U.S. government agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice on high-profile technology deals that raise worries about threats to competition. But antitrust attorneys say there's no guarantee that the commission's ruling on the HP-Compaq merger will sway a federal vote. "The EC and (U.S. Department of Justice) do talk to each other a lot, but they may not reach the same conclusions," said Bill Young, an antitrust attorney with Hunton & Williams in Washington, D.C. "The two agencies have taken different views in the past. Just last year, the (U.S. Department of Justice) approved the Honeywell and General Electric merger, but the EC rejected it." Last year, the commission blocked GE's $43 billion bid to acquire Honeywell, despite earlier approval from U.S. regulators. And in the Microsoft antitrust case, the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state attorneys general late last year reached a settlement with the software giant, while the European agency expanded its investigation into whether Microsoft used its monopoly in operating systems to gain market share in server software. Young noted that the commission tends to review antitrust cases for their potential effect on competitors, while the FTC usually focuses on the implications for consumers. The decision was a shot in the arm for HP's leader, and she was quick to bask in the approval. "We are extremely pleased with the EU's decision," Carly Fiorina, HP's chief executive, said in a statement. "We see it as an encouraging step in the continuing process of satisfying regulators worldwide that this deal will provide a real stimulus for competition in information-technology markets." More votes still to come Compaq spokesman Arch Currid said the companies expect to receive a decision from the United States and other countries around the globe, such as Australia, by the end of February. "Today's decision marks an important step toward final regulatory approval," he said, "but we still have several steps to go." With the European decision now behind them, HP and Compaq are also moving toward a shareholder vote in March--which may prove their biggest obstacle yet. The two companies announced their intention to merge in September. Wall Street and industry analysts largely frowned on the deal in the first days and weeks after the announcement, and more recently some of the fiercest opposition has come from the children of HP's founders, who are influential shareholders. Lately, however, the companies have said that some large institutional shareholders are showing signs of warming to the merger. Walter Hewlett, a dissident HP board member and shareholder and son of co-founder William Hewlett, is waging a battle to get shareholders to vote against the deal, saying it would give the company a greater presence in the low-margin PC business, while diluting its highly profitable printing and imaging operations. "We understand that HP's rivals raised almost no objections to the proposed merger, helping it to gain EC approval," Hewlett said in a statement. "We are not surprised; we believe Dell, Sun Microsystems and IBM must be delighted at the prospect of a merger that would so greatly distract and damage two of their rivals." The European decision should come as no surprise to HP executives. In the weeks leading up to Thursday's deadline for the commission to respond to the merger, the European regulators did not ask the company to divest of any of its businesses, said a source familiar with HP. The source added that HP executives were surprised that the regulators had not made such a request in the weeks and days leading up to the deadline. Competitive concerns The European regulators looked at the potential effects that a newly merged HP would have on the markets for PCs, servers, handheld products, printers, storage hardware and services. They also considered potential antitrust issues regarding HP's joint development efforts with Intel on the Itanium processor. "In view of the presence of strong existing and potential competition in all markets considered," the regulators said in a statement, "the commission concluded that the operation will not result in the creation or strengthening of any dominant position, and has decided not to oppose the concentration." Although the commission said the merger would not result in a dominant position for HP, the company is hoping to achieve something like dominance by evolving to be a significant rival to IBM. HP has said the merger would give it a greater presence in the enterprise computing and consulting markets, allowing it to become a one-stop shop for corporate customers. "We have no comment on the EC's feelings that the merger would not create a dominant position," said Currid. "Their decision was that they felt it would not raise any significant competition in Europe." Fierce competition in the PC arena helped HP in its efforts to win over regulators. Dell, for example, has been on a tear in Europe, indicating that the historical tendency among Europeans to shop in stores or buy local brands is fading. In the third quarter of last year, Dell's Pan-European market share grew from 10 percent to 12 percent, according to figures presented by Jim Schneider, Dell's chief financial officer, at the BofA Securities Conference this week. In the United Kingdom, Dell is the top seller, with 18 percent of the market. It's No. 4 both in Germany (with a 7 percent share) and France (9 percent), and it's ranked 10th in Italy. Although some European sales go to U.S. Fortune 500 companies with offices in Europe, Dell has penetrated the indigenous business and consumer markets, Schneider said. The commission did find that the merger would give HP a "relatively high market share" in the European entry-level server market, but it noted that intense competition and an ever-changing and growing market would eliminate antitrust concerns. HP's pending merger is also not expected give the combined company an anti-competitive edge in the European market for printers--a business that HP has found to be quite lucrative--given "the merged entity's moderate share of the relevant PC market and the limited impact that joint PC/printer sales could have on the new HP's printer market share," the commission said. And in regard to the Itanium processor, the regulators found that it was in HP and Intel's best interest to guarantee competitors unrestricted access to the components.
2001-04-12 - Encryption software aims for Itanium   Covalent Technologies is hoping Intel's Itanium processor will be a good match for its encryption software. Covalent sells encryption software for Web sites using the Apache software. Covalent said it will translate its Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software so it runs on the Itanium chip, the much-delayed flagship of Intel's effort to release a high-end, 64-bit chip to compete with Sun Microsystems and others. Intel has been touting Itanium's ability to encrypt and decrypt secure communications such as credit card transactions.
2006-02-01 - Electric slide for tech industry   SANTA CLARA, Calif.--The computing industry is on a power trip, but it doesn't want to be. Technology providers, customers, government officials and researchers gathered at Sun Microsystems' headquarters here Tuesday to try to tackle some of the problems posed by the runaway consumption of electricity by computing gear. The problems arise from a confluence of business demands, rising energy prices and technology changes, which have led to chips and computers that consume more electricity. The result is a conflict of priorities. Some people try to pack servers in more densely to use floor space better, while others try to space them out to reduce overheating problems. "We're at a perfect storm," Ben Williams, vice president of commercial business for chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, said in a speech at the Global Conference on Energy Efficiency in the Data Center. "Business units are requiring IT departments to do more with less. We have (chief financial officers) question why all the racks aren't filled. The IT guys are saying 'I need another data center.' Then we have the rising cost of energy that's bringing all this to the forefront." But it's in the interest of anyone consuming power to improve efficiency, argued Andrew Fanara of the EPA's Energy Star program. "Companies have to ask themselves, 'Am I willing to bet the cost of energy is going to go down?' That's the cost of doing nothing," Fanara said. To get a grip on the problems, the tech industry has come up with solutions ranging from more energy-efficient Xeon processors to liquid cooling of high-end server systems. Trends aren't promising. Four or five years ago, a 6-foot tall rack full of computing gear would consume 2 to 3 kilowatts, "but now we're talking about 10-, 15- or 20-kilowatt-draw racks," said Sun Chief Technology Officer Greg Papadopoulos. Google has warned that its server electricity costs soon might outpace its server purchase costs. "Companies have to ask themselves, 'Am I willing to bet the cost of energy is going to go down?'" --Andrew Fanara, Energy Star program, EPA The problem is getting worse as data centers packed full of computers proliferate and grow in size. Data centers typically have raised floors with holes in them to direct specially cooled air coming from below straight into server compartments. "Between now and 2009, we expect 12 million additional square footage of raised floor going into marketplace," IDC analyst Vernon Turner said. By comparison, the Mall of America in Minnesota, the world's largest shopping mall, measures 2.5 million square feet. "Think of that filled to the brim with servers," Turner said. A large fraction of the energy consumed in data centers goes to waste, said Bob Sullivan, a data center design expert from the Uptime Institute. In a survey of 19 data centers, 1.4 kilowatts of power are wasted for every kilowatt of power consumed in computing activities, the research consultancy found. Measure the problem The first step, several at the conference agreed, is to develop a useful common measurement of system performance. The industry could then balance that against power consumption, to judge how bad the power efficiency problem is and how effective solutions might be. "Most companies agree the priority...is an objective measurement of the service being delivered," Jonathan Koomey, a computer power expert who works at Stanford University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said in an interview. He expects that measurement to emerge from discussions he's involved in, which have included server makers, the Environmental Protection Agency and others. "I would hope a year from now, we'll have at least a draft metric," he said. But most speakers here were reluctant to suggest a performance measurement process, and several agreed it's a thorny issue. For one thing, different companies inevitably try to pick tests that make their own equipment look good. For another, it's never easy to pick tests that represent the performance of everything from processors to storage and networking. "It's going to be tough to pick something that's broad enough and yet simple enough to be practical on a day-to-day basis," said Peter Bannon, vice president of architecture at P.A. Semi, a start-up that develops low-power processors. Sun's Papadopoulos said that even something as apparently simple as a vehicle's fuel efficiency isn't straightforward to measure--and compare--in reality. A motorcycle beats out a sport-utility vehicle in raw miles per gallon, but an SUV can be more efficient overall because it can carry more passengers. But then SUVs often aren't always filled to capacity with passengers, so utilization also must be factored in. One fix from decades ago that's come back into vogue is liquid cooling. Hewlett-Packard, Egenera, Silicon Graphics and IBM all have added liquid-cooling options to their hardware. "Water cooling and liquid cooling is coming back," data center design expert Sullivan said. "From an efficiency standpoint, the closer you can get water cooling to the processor, the more efficient it's going to be." Plugging processor leaks Chip designers are working on ways to reduce power consumption. Processors have become a major electrical problem in part because newer manufacturing technologies have led to electrical current "leakage" rather than fruitful use. For servers with two processor sockets, Intel's current "Irwindale" models of Xeon chips consume 110 watts. But Michael Patterson, a thermal engineer in Intel's Digital Enterprise Group, said a significant power improvement will arrive in the upcoming "Woodcrest" model. That chip, due in the second half of 2006, has dual-processing cores, employs an architecture taken from the Pentium M mobile processor and is built with a new manufacturing process with 65-nanometer features compared to Irwindale's 90-nanometer process. Woodcrest CPUs will use 80 watts, Patterson said. "That's not a low-voltage part. That's the performance-optimized processor," he said. In addition, Intel said last week that the next "Montecito" generation of its higher-end Itanium processor will consume 100 watts, compared with 130 watts for current models. The next problem will be in the computer's memory subsystem, which will guzzle more than half of a computer's power by 2008, Papadopoulos said. "These things are pigs," he said, and they're only getting worse with the move to DDR2 memory and, later, fully buffered DIMMs," he said, referring to a newer version of the double data rate memory standard and to its higher-speed sequel. Sun just introduced its UltraSparc T1 "Niagara"-based servers, which need much less power than most mainstream servers, and is working on two technologies it hopes will reduce electricity consumption further. "Computer memory subsystems are pigs." --Greg Papadopoulos, chief technology officer, Sun One is proximity input-output, which replaces communications wires and their accompanying processing chips with direct connections between the bottom of one processor and the top of another. Another is technology that has optical, rather than electrical, communication links. Regarding energy use, "proximity I/O is way favorable. You get much higher bit (transfer) rates, and the power-per-bit (cost) goes way down," Papadopoulos said. Also under way are methods to increase server utilization, so that systems can run closer to top capacity. Turner said many customers sheepishly report their servers are only running at 17 percent capacity on average, but in fact that's better than most. One tool in extending utilization is virtualization, a technology that enables several operating systems to reside on the same server, among other things. "Only 20 percent of data centers we survey aren't doing virtualization, and I think they're the 'going out of business' data centers," Turner said. The quickest, easiest step to improve power problems today is to install more-efficient power supplies, Berkeley's Koomey said. The EPA lets manufacturers give such supplies, which convert AC power from the wall to DC power used inside the computer, an "80+" label if they're more than 80 percent efficient. That "Energy Star" label means that they lose less than 20 percent of the power they draw in waste heat. But efficiencies of only 70 or 72 percent are typical for power supplies. Those EPA Energy Star labels won't work for servers, though, because customers order them in too wide a variety of configurations, Patterson said. "There's a huge number of permutations of what it's going to look like. There's not going to be a yellow sticker for each one of those," Patterson said. "We need something, but that's not it." Labels on the power supplies give customers a good leverage to persuade computer equipment suppliers to increase efficiency, Koomey said: "They should be leaning on the vendors, but I'm surprised how little it happens."
2004-08-25 - Dual-core chips bring dual caches  PALO ALTO, Calif.--The dual-core chips that Advanced Micro Devices and Intel plan to bring to market next year won't be sharing their memories. A version of Opteron coming in 2005 and Montecito, a future member of Intel's Itanium family also slated for next year, will both have two processor cores, the actual unit inside a processor that performs the calculations, and each core will have separate caches, pools of memory integrated into the chip for rapid data access, according to company presentations at the Hot Chips conference at Stanford University. Each core of Montecito, for instance, will come with a 1MB level two cache and a 12MB level three cache, according to Cameron McNairy, a researcher at Intel. To date, Intel has mostly said that Montecito's level 3 cache will contain 24MB of memory. Similarly, each core of the dual-core Opteron will have separate caches, said Marius Evers, a researcher at AMD. Putting two cores on one chip increases computing performance while controlling power consumption, a major problem facing designers. Splitting the cache differs from the approach taken by IBM, which came out with the first dual-core server chip with the Power 4, according to Kevin Krewell, editor in chief of the Microprocessor Report. Keeping the cache as one single unit theoretically allows each processor core to access more data in a rapid fashion. Dividing the cache, however, also cuts down on some design work. "Under time pressure, it is the easiest way for these guys," Krewell said. Later, they may unify the caches. Sun is taking a similar approach with the dual-core UltraSparc IV, he added. Intel will likely flesh out its dual-core chip strategy at the Intel Developer Forum, which takes place in San Francisco in September. Along with Montecito, Intel will come out with a dual-core chip for desktops in the second half of 2005. Other IDF highlights include the release of an Itanium 2 with 9MB of cache, according to sources. AMD, meanwhile, will detail its dual-core plans at the Microprocessor Forum starting Oct. 5 in San Jose, according to the conference program. AMD's dual-core chips are due in the second half of 2005 as well. Speaking of the Microprocessor Forum, Krewell said the sponsoring organization will not be handing out its trademark portfolio that contains chips highlighted at the conference embedded in the portfolio cover. Companies no longer give samples out, Krewell explained.
2006-06-23 - Dual-core AMD Turion slow out of the gate  The early results on AMD's dual-core Turion 64 X2 mobile processor are not encouraging, neither in terms of performance nor power management. Our first Turion 64 X2-based laptop, the HP Compaq nx6325, just finished up in the CNET Labs, and we thought we'd share the results here ahead of the review. With a Turion 64 X2 TL-56 processor running at 1.8GHz, the HP Compaq nx6325 produced an overall SysMark 2004 score of 155, which trails by a healthy 17 to 18 percent the scores from similarly outfitted systems, such as the Panasonic ToughBook 74 and the Compaq Presario V3000, that use a 1.8GHz Intel Core Duo chip. One possible explanation: the Turion 64 X2 serves up half the L2 cache (1MB) found on the Core Duo (2MB). Core Duo chips can dip into a larger pool of L2 cache as they make their way through SysMark workloads. Perhaps under heavy multitasking scenarios, the fact that each core on a Turion 64 X2 chip has its own L2 memory cache (as opposed to the Core Duo's single repository that the two cores must share) can help AMD's processor enjoy better results. Although the nx6325 topped the Core Solo-based Toshiba Tecra A6 by 15 percent on SysMark, we expected a Turion 64 X2 system to be able to swim along side its dual-core Intel competition rather than treading in the muddy waters between Intel's single- and dual-core mobile offerings. SysMark 2004 performance(Longer bars indicate better performance) BAPCo SysMark 2004 rating SysMark 2004 Internet-content-creation rating SysMark 2004 office-productivity rating HP Compaq Presario V3000 (Core Duo T2400) 190 242 149 Panasonic ToughBook 74 (Core Duo T2400) 187 239 147 HP Compaq nx6325 (Turion 64 X2 TL-56) 155 203 119 Toshiba Tecra A6-S513 (Core Solo T1300) 132 146 120 In another underwhelming performance, the HP Compaq nx6325 finished behind its predecessor on CNET Labs' MobileMark application benchmark. The older HP Compaq nx6125 features a single-core AMD Turion 64 chip running at 2GHz, and it bested the dual-core nx6325 on our mobile application performance benchmark. Power-saving features factor heavily into the test, which is run while a laptop is on battery power, but the nx6325 doesn't offer much more in terms of battery life, lasting a mere 7 minutes longer. Granted, this is our first glimpse at a Turion 64 X2-based laptop. We'll be able to present a more rounded picture of AMD's new dual-core mobile chips as we're able to test more systems, but if the HP Compaq nx6325 is any indication, Intel's Core Duo can rest easy for now.

2004-09-02 - Dual cores to lead Intel show  Intel will demonstrate a dual-core processor at the Intel Developer Forum next week and provide details on other technology initiatives intended to help the company claw its way out of a very difficult year. Dual-core chips will likely be one of the highlights of the three-day conference, which takes place from Sept. 7 through 9 in San Francisco. Rival Advanced Micro Devices earlier this week demonstrated a dual-core version of its Opteron chip. Both companies are slated to start popping out dual-core chip in the middle of 2005. Dual-core chips' two processing cores increase performance without significantly increasing power consumption. Intel will show off at least one dual-core chip at the conference, according to Frank Spindler, vice president of the corporate technology group at Intel. Other sources said Intel will also provide code names for its dual-core Xeon and Pentium chips, which roll out in the second half of 2005. The dual-core demonstration is slated for Wednesday, but may get moved to the Tuesday morning keynote speech by Paul Otellini, Intel's president and CEO-to-be. Which chip gets demonstrated is a big issue. If Intel shows off a dual-core version of its Xeon or Pentium chips, which compete directly against the Opteron family, analysts will likely surmise that the two companies are currently tied in the development process. If Intel only shows a dual-core Itanium chip, however, it may be seen as a sign that Intel has fallen behind slightly. Itanium chips sell in lower volumes, and a dual-core Itanium project has been in the works longer. "It would hardly be a surprise if they were to demonstrate the dual-core Itanium, because they have displayed wafers before," said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64. "If they demonstrated dual-core Xeons, it would suggest they are further along than previously suspected." The company will also likely use the conference to reiterate that it has begun to tackle many of the execution issues that have caused numerous product delays. Some progress has already been made, according to some. "There has been a pretty fundamental change in how they do things," said Dean McCarron, an analyst at Mercury Research. "They are going back to the situation where there is a very high probability of something being delivered when they say it will." Other conference highlights are likely to include: Servers: Intel has said it will release an Itanium 2 chip with a 9MB cache around this time of the year. If the chip doesn't come out at the show, that could be a sign of further delays. In any event, Itanium sales have continued to build on the growth experienced in 2003, McCarron said. Prices have also dropped. The company now sells a low-end Itanium 2 for $530, less than some desktop chips. Desktops: Louis Burns and Bill Siu, who jointly manage the desktop platforms group, will unveil an effort to develop standards for what the company calls the Digital Office. PC manufacturers at the show or Intel will also likely provide updates on the progress of the ePC and other living room technologies. Otellini and others will also give updates on some of the technologies, such as LaGrande, Vanderpool and Silvervale, that will increase security and performance of PC processors. Some of these require Microsoft's Windows update, Longhorn or other unreleased operating systems. Longhorn isn't due until 2006. Information on Shelton, a prototype chip to be marketed in developing nations, may also come out at the conference. At last year's conference, Otellini revealed Intel was looking into development of chips for these markets. Communications: Progress on the advanced wireless standard WiMax will be discussed, as will work on the Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture (ATCA) initiative to get networking manufacturers to adopt common architectural standards. After a slow start, several companies have begun to adopt ATCA, Spindler said. Consumer electronics: Announcements on a wireless version of USB as well as serial ATA standards for hard drives in consumer electronics are expected.
2007-04-03 - Despite its aging design the x86 is still in charge    Few computing technologies from the late 1970s endure today, with one notable exception: the fundamental marching orders for the vast majority of the world's computers. The x86 instruction set architecture (ISA), used today in more than 90 percent of the world's PCs and servers, hit the marketplace in 1978 as part of Intel's 8086 chip. So when the worldwide Intel developer's community gathers for its annual conference in Beijing later this month, they'll spend most of their time talking about technology that was developed when Jimmy Carter was in the White House and the soundtrack for the John Travolta movie Saturday Night Fever was the best-selling album in the United States. Other instruction sets--which are basically, lists of operations that a software program can use--do exist, of course. There's IBM's Power, Sun Microsystems' Sparc and Intel's own EPIC (explicitly parallel instruction computing) Itanium project, to name a few. But x86 continues to thrive and has no serious competitors on the horizon because it provides "good enough" performance and because of the vast amount of software written over nearly three decades. "If you look at the history of computing, big moves happen because there is a dramatic new requirement or change in the marketplace," said a professor of computer science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who uses the single name Arvind. But x86 is apparently an exception to the rule. Whether it's the invention of the browser or low-cost network computers that were supposed to make PCs go away, the engineers behind x86 find a way to make it adapt to the situation. Is that a problem? Critics say x86 is saddled with the burden of supporting outdated features and software, and that improvements in energy efficiency and software development have been sacrificed to its legacy. A comedian would say it all depends on what you think about disco.Humble beginnings The x86 ISA made its debut with Intel's 8086 processor in 1978. Even at the time, it wasn't considered the most elegant implementation on the market because of the way it searched for memory addresses, said Dean McCarron, an analyst with Mercury Research. IBM chose a slightly different version--the 8088--for its new PC, and the x86 architecture started to gain traction. "It was originally thought about as an eight-bit chip (Intel's and Advanced Micro Devices' current chips are 64-bits) designed to run spreadsheets," said Phil Hester, chief technology officer at AMD. Accordingly, the original design lacked support for, among other things, an appropriate number of general-purpose registers that would be needed for the modern computing era. Registers are essentially small holding stations for data as it awaits processing, and general-purpose registers are useful because they can store either data or an address where that data is stored. "There's no reason whatsoever why the Intel architecture remains so complex." --Simon Crosby CTO, XenSource As the number of people using PCs made by IBM and so-called clone manufacturers grew, the x86 became the irreplaceable heart of the PC market. In the mid-1990s, Intel's entry into the server market with x86 chips cemented the ISA's dominance. Today, more than 90 percent of all servers shipped in the world use an x86 processor from either Intel or AMD. Intel and AMD have managed to keep x86 fresh by continually adding extensions to the ISA, such as Intel's MMX and SSE instructions in the mid-'90s that improved graphics performance, and AMD's 64-bit extensions this decade that helped bypass the register issue. "We have seen a huge amount of change at the instruction level; we just keep calling it the same thing," said Rick Rashid, a senior vice president at Microsoft in charge of that company's research division. But with each generation of extensions to the x86 ISA, more and more complexity is added to the chips, and support for the older feature remains to guarantee software compatibility. "There's no reason whatsoever why the Intel architecture remains so complex," said Simon Crosby, chief technology officer at virtualization software start-up XenSource. "There's no reason why they couldn't ditch 60 percent of the transistors on the chip, most of which are for legacy modes." If a chipmaker declared its chip could run only software written past some date such as 1990 or 1995, you would see a dramatic decrease in cost and power consumption, Crosby said. The problem is that deep inside Windows is code taken from the MS-DOS operating system of the early 1980s, and that code looks for certain instructions when it boots. This was part of the motivation behind Intel and Hewlett-Packard's EPIC project: a "clean-sheet" design that would remove many of x86's idiosyncrasies and support for legacy technologies, providing a modern foundation for the next 20 years. Instead, EPIC became a lesson in how not to introduce a new instruction set. Software developers shied away from having to learn a new computing language, and early roll-out problems hindered Intel and HP's chances of building a broad market for the processor. The warm embrace of AMD's Opteron x86-64 processor (later duplicated by Intel) was the final blow, relegating EPIC and Itanium to the high end of the server market where it makes sense to port applications to take advantage of the performance offered by Itanium. As with most things, it all came down to money. Billions of dollars have been invested in software written for x86. Even Intel--one of the most influential companies in the technology industry--couldn't convince software developers to move away from all those investments. Is there an alternative? Last year, Intel Chief Technology Officer Justin Rattner said the company had no plans to develop a new ISA in the foreseeable future. Microsoft's Rashid said his group doesn't have any projects that involve a rival instruction set, although Microsoft supported several different instruction sets as recently as 1999 with Windows NT 4.0. So what might change the game? Performance is always one way to make software developers sit up and take notice, but there's nothing dramatic on the horizon. It's unlikely that any so-called "clean sheet" design would be able to produce more than a 10 percent improvement in performance or power consumption over the modern x86 ISA, Hester said. A performance improvement that small isn't going to encourage a dramatic move away from x86, said Pat Gelsinger, a veteran chip designer and senior vice president and general manager of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group. "We're delivering 2x performance gains every year" with existing designs that can still run older applications. The chip industry's ability to continue packing transistors onto its processors means that it dedicates fewer and fewer transistors--out of the whole--to keeping legacy code alive. "The burden of compatibility is there," Gelsinger said. "But the value of compatibility overwhelms the cost it brings with it." One technology improvement that could be a wild card in the mix is the introduction of new chips with two or more processing cores. Chipmakers have settled on building chips with several lower-speed processor cores as a way of getting around power consumption problems caused by a single high-speed core. Right now, however, each core needs to use the same instruction set. Some think a hybrid future is possible: smaller, more power-efficient cores could be created on an x86 using other ISAs that would be dedicated for specific tasks, like video processing, Arvind said. IBM is doing something like this with its Cell processor design, found at the heart of Sony's PlayStation 3. Cell uses one PowerPC core in a sort of supervisory role over eight separate processing units. Further on down the road, chip companies could keep a basic x86 core to maintain backward compatibility and handle the next generation of complicated processing tasks with dedicated hardware--that may or may not run x86. The earliest parts of this transition can be seen in efforts such as AMD's Fusion project, in which it plans to integrate a graphics processor onto a PC processor, McCarron said. By the next decade, processors with a mixture of cores using different ISAs could become a reality, he said. But don't count on it. "What has worked in (x86's) favor is that it's an evolutionary architecture, when problems come up it gets adapted," McCarron said. "This is ultimately the one that got picked. And for everything to work with each other, that's what we stick to."CNET News.com's Stephen Shankland contributed to this report.
2002-07-01 - Dell to skip Itanium 2 for now A number of server and software manufacturers will tout new products based around Intel's Itanium 2 processor when the chip is released next week, but Dell Computer won't be among them. The Round Rock, Texas-based PC manufacturer has no definite plans for Itanium 2 servers and will not be on hand when Intel unveils the chip, said a company representative. "At this point, we are in a bit of a wait-and-see mode with Itanium 2," the representative said. The absence of Dell will likely be awkward for Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel. Dell is the largest PC manufacturer in the world and is a growing presence in the server market. In terms of revenue, Dell was the fifth-largest server maker worldwide in the first quarter of 2002, commanding 8 percent of sales, according to research firm IDC. And in terms of units, Dell was the No. 2 server maker in the world during the first quarter, with 17.8 percent of the market, according to research firm Gartner. Dell is also one of the few companies growing its market share. In the first quarter, Dell saw its market share rise 14.2 percent while most major manufacturers saw their market shares shrink. "It is going to be a bit embarrassing for Intel," said Kevin Krewell, an analyst with Microprocessor Report, an influential semiconductor newsletter. Next week Intel will launch the Itanium 2, a complex server chip designed to fit into servers that will compete against the most expensive machines from Sun Microsystems and IBM. Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Fujitsu, Microsoft and several Linux companies will launch products or discuss their plans for Itanium 2 next week, according to sources, while Intel will show off benchmarks intended to demonstrate that these new servers outperform similar Sun boxes and cost less. "We will have more OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and more models with Itanium 2 than with Itanium," said an Intel representative. Dell's reluctance comes down to demand. The company is still in the process of gauging how popular the chip will be with customers, the representative said. Unlike other Intel chips, the Itanium family requires completely new software, and the software is just being made now. The first Itanium chip, released in May 2001 after several delays, has sold poorly, owing in part to lackluster performance, a declining economy and an absence of software. Intel and many of its server partners assert that the experience with Itanium 2 will be different. Intel improved the overall design of the chip and has been working actively with software developers to port applications and operating systems to Itanium 2, which once went by the code-name McKinley. Itanium, though, also doesn't fit Dell's business model well. Dell prefers to concentrate on high-volume products and doesn't dedicate massive amounts of resources to independent research and development. Itanium 2 will largely be found in servers containing four to 16 processors--not a huge market in terms of units. Itanium 2 servers also generally require intensive design work. Both IBM and HP are using their own chipsets in their respective Itanium 2 servers. Intel, though, will try to cut some of the design burden for smaller manufacturers by making Itanium 2 servers that they can sell under their own brand names. "It is an admission by Dell that the Itanium 2 family doesn't have the value needed for the Dell model," Krewell said. Krewell also said, "McKinley is nice, but any volume is a year out." Dell's relationship with Intel over Itanium has always been a bit rocky. Dell came out with an Itanium workstation last year but then unceremoniously discontinued it after a few months. Last November, Joe Marengi, senior vice president and general manager, Dell Americas, said that demand for the original Itanium was "effectively zero" and that software developers had little incentive to port their applications to the chip. Dell has also been performing tests on Hammer, the server chip coming from Advanced Micro Devices next year, according to sources at Dell and AMD. Chief Executive Michael Dell and AMD Chairman Jerry Sanders also engaged in a public display of good-natured backslapping earlier this year at Merrill Lynch's Hardware Heaven conference. Dell, however, has tested AMD technology for years and never adopted it. Although it has no plans for Itanium 2, Dell will continue to sell the PowerEdge 7150 server, which contains plain Itanium processors.
2005-09-15 - Dell shuttering Itanium server business    Dell is phasing out Intel Itanium-based servers, a move by one of the chipmaker's closest allies that reflects Dell's emphasis on low-cost servers and the processor's failure to spread into the mainstream. A representative with Round Rock, Texas-based Dell said Thursday that an Itanium transition is under way now. Itanium servers are no longer promoted on Dell's Web site, which now directs attention solely to servers using Intel's Xeon. But Itanium-based models such as the PowerEdge 7250 can be found by searching. Though Dell remains the largest seller of Intel processors, the decision to drop Itanium has not caused widespread panic at Intel. "Losing Dell as an Itanium customer is unfortunate, but frankly, we see their impact as negligible," Intel representative Erica Fields said. Hewlett-Packard is by far the biggest in the Itanium server market, but Fujitsu, NEC, Hitachi, Unisys and SGI also sell their own high-end Itanium servers. The writing was on the wall for Dell and Itanium once Intel started aiming the processor at large multiprocessor systems instead of the broader server market. For one thing, Dell has publicly spurned massive "big iron" computers as "less and less interesting." Indeed, in 2002, the company scrapped a deal to sell a 32-processor Xeon server built by Unisys. Microsoft moves sway Dell More recent decisions at Microsoft also reinforce Dell's direction. A coming version of Windows Server 2003 called R2 is geared for smaller servers and won't support Itanium, and the next Windows server operating system, code-named Longhorn server, will only be geared for high-end server tasks, Microsoft said this month. Dell's interest in Itanium has ranged all the way from lukewarm to complete indifference. In November 2001, Joe Marengi, the co-manager for Dell Americas, explained that interest among customers for Itanium servers was "effectively zero." "The investment involved in the transition in huge," he said at the time. "I don't see the speed and benefit to what the processor brings to the equation," he added. Itanium had also been subject to several delays. In the summer of 2002, Dell was still in wait-and-see mode. But, by November 2002, Marengi said, Dell had a change of heart and would begin to produce Itanium 2 servers. However, Dell was also phasing out a line of Itanium workstations. Intel also designed and partly manufactured the Itanium 2 servers Dell sold, which reduced the time, money and effort Dell was required to spend. Dell isn't the only one to turn its back on Itanium. IBM this year decided against Itanium support for a high-end server chipset that as a result only works with Intel's Xeon chips. IBM has its own Power processor to promote for high-end servers. Itanium allies have also withdrawn from other markets. In 2004, Microsoft canceled a workstation version of Windows for Itanium after HP canceled its workstation. Itanium shipments fell short of Intel goals in 2004. The company had hoped to double 2003 shipments. Still-active developments Despite the problems, allies are still plugging away at Itanium. A number of companies are expected to announce an Itanium market development alliance later this month to try to help with software support and other activities. The alliance made up of Intel, HP, Microsoft, Oracle and others is expected to sponsor porting events to help programmers bring their software to the processor and find combinations of Itanium hardware and software for various tasks. And there are years of new Itanium chips planned from Intel, starting with the first dual-core model later this year. That chip, code-named Montecito, will more than double performance over the current "Madison" generation of Itanium processors, Intel has said. After Montecito comes a derivative called Montvale, as well as a new four-core design called Tukwila and another four-core design called Poulson.
2003-06-25 - Dell server draws on Madison   Dell Computer is wading back into 64-bit computing waters with a new rack-mount server. The Round Rock, Texas, PC maker on Wednesday said it would begin selling the PowerEdge 3250, a server based on the upcoming higher-performance "Madison" version of Intel's 64-bit Itanium 2 processor. Dell at one time made a 64-bit server based on the first Itanium, but it chose to discontinue that product and skip to its successor, the "McKinley" chip, which became the first Itanium 2. The new PowerEdge 3250, first shown last April, is designed to use the Madison Itanium 2 in a 3-inch-high, rack-mount server designed for a specific application in high-performance computing clusters, the company said. Clusters, which tie together large numbers of standard servers to harness their collective processing power, are becoming increasingly popular with large corporations and educational institutions because of their relatively low cost and high performance. Though special purpose-built supercomputers are still considered to be superior for some tasks, such as predicting the weather, clusters can now handle many tasks that were reserved for supercomputers just a few years ago. Clusters also play to Dell's goals of selling large numbers of servers. Because they string together hundreds--or potentially thousands--of servers in a single sale, the computer maker has put great emphasis on the cluster program. Clusters have also helped fuel growth by chipmaker Intel in the high-performance and scientific computing market. While Dell did not announce pricing or an exact ship date, the new PowerEdge 3250 is expected to come in at the high end of the company's server products and related cluster products. The company is expected to tout the advantages of 64-bit Itanium servers over their 32-bit Intel Xeon brethren--benefits such as the ability to handle more physical memory and to perform floating-point calculations with more aplomb--for markets such as those that use financial models, genomic research or even movie special effects. The Itanium 2 was chosen for the PowerEdge 3250 specifically for its number-crunching ability and its ability to support much more RAM than a Xeon chip, Dell executives said during a conference call. The new machine will be based on two Itanium 2 processors and will be able to use up to 16GB of RAM and 292GB of hard-drive storage, Dell said. The company will offer the system with Microsoft's Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition or with Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating systems. The system will come in clusters of 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 single servers, or nodes, based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The new PowerEdge 3250 will complement, but not replace, Dell's existing wide range of 32-bit Xeon processor server models, which will be sold alongside the new machine. Next week, Intel is expected to officially launch the new Madison chip at speeds of at least 1.3GHz. The chipmaker will come out with a version of Madison specially designed for dual-processor systems, said Tom Gibbs, director of industry marketing at Intel, in a recent interview. Dell isn't the only company interested in 64-bit clusters. Earlier this week, IBM revealed its design for a rack-mount server based on Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron, a rival to the new Itanium 2 chips. Computer makers such as Hewlett-Packard are also likely to offer the new Madison processor as well.
2000-06-20 - Dell expands Linux commitment with Red Hat deal    The prospects for Linux got rosier today as Dell Computer joined the parade of PC makers working to make the relatively new operating system more appealing to big business. Linux seller Red Hat will be a prime beneficiary of the move. Dell, which is well behind Compaq Computer in sales of Linux systems, will work with Red Hat to beef up marketing, support and Linux itself, the companies announced today. Dell has been the computer maker most closely aligned with Microsoft and Intel--the two halves of the "Wintel" alliance--but today's news marks a new step back from Microsoft. Under the new arrangement, Dell will elevate Linux to the status of Microsoft Windows and Novell Netware, building ties with Red Hat's programmers, customer support team, sales force and others. "There's a lot of marketing hype around this, but I think it is a pretty significant announcement that Dell wants to push Linux," said Technology Business Research analyst Brooks Gray. "They're straying more from the Microsoft platform. And clearly they've had a lot of demand for (Linux)." Though financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, Red Hat expects to make money by getting new customers in big business, said Red Hat chief executive Matthew Szulik. These sort of deals are central to Red Hat's future. Because Linux software can be obtained for free, Red Hat and others expect to thrive by offering Linux-related services. Chairman Robert Young has said that eventually, the company could become the Wal-Mart of the Linux world, offering a panoply of products and services. Dell, for its part, hopes the alliance will increase pressure on traditional rivals IBM, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems by allowing Dell to sell more equipment to build up the Internet, said Mike Lambert, senior vice president of Dell's enterprise systems group. As first reported by CNET News.com, Dell looked at embracing Unix to compete better in an Internet-dominated computing world. In February, Dell settled on using Linux instead, though it didn't rule out a version of Unix called Monterey under development from IBM and Santa Cruz Operation. Linux is a clone of Unix, similar in design and function though not as battle-tested or as able to run on super-powerful servers. Lambert acknowledged the lead traditional Unix has over Linux but argued that Dell isn't interested in taking on the entire Unix server market and that its alliance with Red Hat will help improve Linux. "I think it's a fair statement that at the very high end of processing, there are five-nines kind of requirements (that a computer stay up and running 99.999 percent of the time) that have been baked into Unix variants over the last five to 10 years. That's really not where we're aiming at this point in time," Lambert said. The Dell-Red Hat alliance fits well with the strategy of Intel, which like Dell has invested in Red Hat. Intel views Linux as one of three major operating systems that will prevail on its upcoming Itanium chip and its successors in the "IA-64" family, along with Windows and Monterey. Though Dell and Red Hat called today's initiative the "one-source alliance," Red Hat is hardly the sole source for Linux products and services at Dell. Dell executives said the company will in fact maintain its relationships with TurboLinux and Linuxcare, two Red Hat competitors. Dell sells computers in Japan and elsewhere in Asia using TurboLinux's version of Linux, said Russ Holt, general manager of Dell's workgroup server group. And though Red Hat is the default company to provide support for Linux computers sold by Dell, customers may select Linuxcare as well, Lambert said. In the alliance, Dell and Red Hat will work jointly to improve Linux's high-end abilities with technologies such as clustering, which ties together multiple servers to share workload or step in for one another if one fails, Szulik said. In addition, Dell and Red Hat will work to tune Linux for specific hardware designs such as Dell's special-purpose PowerApp servers. Keeping servers up and running around the clock means more opportunity for services revenue for Dell and Red Hat. Ensuring that level of performance requires a lot of planning as well as ongoing monitoring when the system is up and running, services for which companies charge premium rates. Though customers will pay Dell for such services, some of the money will flow to Red Hat, depending on who's actually doing the job, Holt said. High-availability services also require close collaboration between the hardware and software developers, added Red Hat chief technical officer Michael Tiemann. "It's now possible to align the hardware and software," he said. The companies will work together to prepare Linux for Intel's Itanium chip. Dell and Red Hat also announced today that automaker Toyota will buy 1,400 Dell computers with Red Hat software to serve as information kiosks in all Toyota and Lexus dealerships in the United States.
2006-04-10 - Dell exec We're not Wintel's lapdog    BOSTON--To some, Dell marches to the beat of Intel and Microsoft drums, dutifully following their research and development plans. But to hear Kevin Kettler tell it, the PC maker often takes its own lead. Not only is the company active in establishing technologies, but often it's the kingmaker for emerging standards, Dell's chief technology officer said. In an interview at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo here, Kettler outlined several areas where Dell has gone its own way--over objections from Intel and Microsoft--and has cut behind-the-scenes deals that brought new developments to market. Essentially, Kettler argued, Dell was responsible for selecting, if not necessarily developing, many of the technologies in today's desktop computers and servers. Among standards for which he said Dell deserves credit are 802.11 wireless networking, PCI Express communications technology and 64-bit extensions to Intel's x86 line of processors. Dell's assertiveness has led to friction at times between the company and its major allies, however. Just last Monday, Kettler spent eight hours in a meeting with Intel. It was productive, but it "wasn't pretty," he said. In the past, Microsoft and Intel had more power, said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technology Associates. There were few alternatives when PC companies wanted to buy chips or operating systems, and not many computer makers were dominant enough to set terms. But now, with major consolidation in the number of PC sellers as well, there are more power struggles, he said. "Some very large players--Cisco in networking, Microsoft in operating systems, Intel in chips, Dell in PCs, Best Buy in distribution--they're all jockeying for a dominant position, bluffing, feinting," Kay said. And overall, Dell does indeed hold more power than the past. "It's a little braggadocio, but I think essentially the story holds," he added. But overall, Dell tends to follow Intel's lead and isn't setting the agenda, said Gartner analyst Steve Kleynhans. "They tend to get involved at the point where technology is getting standardized, and they popularize it. They get it out to a lot of people," he said. "But I don't see them as being the driver of a technology or the one that sets the direction." Dell's duels In the case of wireless networking, Dell pushed back against Intel's fondness for the now-defunct HomeRF standard, Kettler said. It did so strongly enough to convince the company to switch its support to the 802.11 standard that is widely used today. Intel saw HomeRF as inexpensive and good for the home. Dell, however, wanted a single technology for work and home, so customers wouldn't have to switch network adapters when they carried their laptops back and forth, Kettler said. Dell convinced Intel to go with 802.11 everywhere, but to price it at the same level as the cheap HomeRF alternative. It argued that Intel would make more money from selling a large number of 802.11 adapters with a slimmer profit margin than from selling smaller amounts of a more expensive adapter geared to work environments. Kevin Kettler It was, therefore, Dell's actions that dramatically reduced the cost of 802.11 networking gear, he argued. Intel declined to comment on specific situations described this story. In general, though, it acknowledged both cooperation and some tension with Dell. "We love Dell. They indeed play a critical role with innovation and standards as the world's largest seller of PCs, and they certainly keep us on our toes every day," the company said in a statement. More tension arrived in the area of processors, especially when Intel was faced with a move to advanced chips with 64-bit abilities. Instead of endowing its x86 chips, such as Pentium and Xeon, with 64-bit features, Intel aggressively pushed its Itanium line. Dell, though, urged Intel to boost x86--the direction rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices took. "Next time to you talk to Pat (Gelsinger, head of Intel's server group and its former CTO), ask him where the demand for 64-bit memory extensions (to x86 chips) came from," Kettler said. While Dell ditched its Itanium systems in 2005, the decision to do so actually came much earlier, Kettler said. It made the shift in 2003, when it dropped plans for an eight-processor Xeon server. The time lag was because Dell had to keep selling some models for those few customers who wanted Itanium systems, but most just weren't interested in them, he said. If it were up to Kettler, Intel would drastically scale back its Itanium work--a direction 180 degrees opposed to Intel's increasing investments in the chip. "I ask how many developers they have on Itanium," every time he meets with Gelsinger, he said. Whatever the answer, Kettler says, "That's two times too much." "We love Dell." --Intel, in a statement Kettler oversaw Dell's memory technology before becoming CTO four years ago. In that earlier role, he inherited one mess: Intel's strong affinity for Rambus memory subsystem, a product fraught with delays, technical difficulties and business problems. Intel eventually backed off the Rambus technology in favor of today's prevailing standard, double data rate (DDR) memory, which is more broadly endorsed. More recent memory troubles have hit Intel. The slow transition to a variant of DDR called FB-DIMM is holding back the arrival of servers with dual-core "Dempsey" Xeon processors. Dell suffered because Intel didn't draft enough industry support for FB-DIMM, Kettler said. Dell didn't invent PCI Express, the higher-speed successor to the prevailing Peripheral Component Interconnect technology for plugging in video cards, but it should get more credit for ensuring its success, Kettler said. It was Dell's market clout that gave graphics chip companies such as ATI and Nvidia the confidence that they could make the jump to PCI Express from the previous Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) connectors, he said. Picking on Microsoft Intel isn't the only major ally to have fallen out of step with Dell. The PC maker's customer surveys have led it to believe the Blu-ray format should succeed DVDs, Kettler said. At the same time, royalties for Blu-ray are lower than for the rival HD DVD format, and the Blu-ray video content is better, he added. Microsoft and Intel endorsed HD DVD over Blu-ray in September, and Hewlett-Packard, formerly a strong Blu-ray advocate, softened its stance shortly afterward. Kettler suggested Microsoft hasn't revealed the true reason for its fondness for the format. The company has a "franchise to protect," he said: its Xbox business, which competes with the Blu-ray-enabled Sony PlayStation 3. Microsoft, not surprisingly, disagreed with this assessment and asserted its motives for preferring HD DVD are broader. HD DVD drives and disks are cheaper and arriving sooner, argued Jordi Ribas, director of technical strategy in the Windows Digital Media Division, and interactive elements of the disks are easier to program in HD DVD's iHD than in Blu-ray's Java. "With Intel and HP sharing our views on this as well, I would say these (factors) are more critical for the PC ecosystem than for gaming," Ribas said. "Blu-ray has been spinning a good yarn over the past year, but it's becoming clearer that the technology is more expensive and has fewer features, and many of their technology claims are far from deliverable." Dell is sticking to its guns, though. "Microsoft may bitch, Intel may bitch," but the customers want Blu-ray, and that's what matters to the PC maker, Kettler said. While Dell has argued that it has a tight connection to customers, it doesn't have a perfect track record of predicting what they want, Kleynhans said. "They didn't do so well with the Dell DJ" music player, and the company opted for smart cards to store encrypted passwords on PCs rather than the trusted platform modules that the industry ended up preferring, he said. "History shows there are wins and losses for all of these guys," Kleynhans said.
2003-07-21 - Dell axes high-end server  Dell once argued that an eight-processor server was powerful enough for most folks. Now, the company has backed off plans for systems even that size, canceling an Intel partnership in the process. Learn more Dell and servers Dell had been funding Intel to build a chipset to yoke together as many as eight Intel Xeon processors for larger servers that are used for such demanding tasks as housing sales databases. But improvements in smaller two- and four-processor systems outpaced that of eight-processor systems during the "extended time" it took to develop the larger machine, said Neil Hand, a director of product marketing at Dell. "The performance of two- and four-way systems went up at a faster rate than anything else," Hand said. "We don't plan to bring an eight-way Xeon system to market." Dell isn't abandoning the high-end server market to established server competitors such as Sun Microsystems, IBM and Hewlett-Packard. Instead, it's regrouping by trying to advance the idea of linking smaller machines into the equivalent of a larger multiprocessor machine. In an effort to reach annual revenue of $60 billion, Dell has been expanding into new product areas, and higher-end "enterprise" server and storage equipment has led that plan. But the end of the eight-processor system illustrates the difficulties Dell faces when that effort carries the company beyond its areas of expertise. "The stuff you can buy that's really a commodity, that doesn't need much vendor support, Dell is great at," said Insight64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. But large servers are a different matter, he added. "I don't think people want to buy systems in that price class from Dell. Maybe someday they will, but right now Dell's strength is in the one-way, two-way, four-way (market), and it drops off really quickly from that." Scale 'em up, scale 'em out Indeed, in the first quarter of 2003, Dell sold just 400 eight-processor servers, a tiny fraction of the 246,000 total it shipped, according to IDC analyst Mark Melenovsky. Dell plays a small part in the eight-processor Intel server market, which had sales of $237 million in the first quarter of 2003, he said. Dell's decision reflects a debate in the computing industry about the best way to handle server work. Traditionally, heavy-duty applications ran on single machines such as Unix servers or mainframes that today have dozens of processors. This technology, called SMP, for symmetrical multiprocessing, also is known in industry jargon as "scaling up." Increasingly, though, computing companies are emphasizing an alternative called "scaling out," spreading work across a large number of vastly less-expensive low-end servers. Some tasks, such as hosting Web sites, are amenable to this approach, but with others, such as hosting large databases, it's more difficult. Although the scale-out approach has major support from companies such as Oracle, it's still a young technology, and there's still a lively market for multiprocessor servers. Skipping much of the higher-end server market hardly spells economic doom for Dell. Melenovsky pointed out that lower-end systems are getting more powerful, the eight-processor server market accounted for a small fraction of the $5.1 billion Intel server market in the first quarter and, in the long run, Dell's approach is likely to prevail. "To a large extent, their strategic position is pretty close to the mark of where we think a lot of the market is going to head," Melenovsky said. A four-processor server will be a building block out of which bigger multiprocessor servers will be assembled. That transition will take place over the next four or five years, he predicted. Hand has a faster schedule. He said scale-out technologies are ready today, bolstered notably by Oracle's 9i Real Application Clusters database software. The time has come for Dell to take on the disbelievers and help tip the balance, he said. "Now is the right time to drive strategic investments behind scale-out. If the market is left to debate what is the right one, then this transition will be delayed," Hand said. "I think it's ready now. It's not unusual to find skepticism when there's any level of change out there." Fighting over the high end Dell has been gaining server market share, but its ambitions for selling higher-end hardware haven't always been fulfilled. In 1999, it began selling the eight-processor PowerEdge 8450 based on Intel's Profusion chipset. "They failed miserably with the Profusion product a few years ago," Brookwood said. In 2000, Dell signed a deal to sell Unisys' 32-processor Xeon server, but canceled the deal a little more than a year later. And in storage systems, Dell aggressively funded in-house efforts before eventually opting to sell systems from storage specialist EMC. While Dell is retreating, Unisys, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and NEC are getting more aggressive with high-end Intel servers. "Clearly, the large-scale SMP market is the bigger market today and will continue to be for awhile," said Tim Dougherty, director of marketing for IBM's Intel server group. "As two-way and four-way systems get more powerful, that'll change." Part of the efforts by Dell competitors to build large servers are linked to a push by Microsoft and Intel to gain a foothold in the high-end server market, where unit shipments are small but revenue is immense. Microsoft has begun boasting that Windows Server 2003 has attained some of the high-end server abilities previously reserved for Unix and mainframes. And Intel, helped in particular by the higher performance of its Itanium family of chips, now sells processors used in servers the size of a pair of refrigerators. Hand has no doubts, though. He believes Dell's close contact with customers gives the company a better idea of coming trends. "Dell is a very pragmatic company," Hand said. "A lot has changed since we started on larger SMP boxes a couple years ago. Market conditions have changed a lot, technology has changed a lot and customer input has changed."
2004-07-01 - Defense bill could stifle computer trade   In a move that has re-energized the debate over export controls on high-performance computers, the latest version of a defense-spending bill would require companies to seek licenses to export even underpowered desktop computers. News.context What's new: The latest version of a defense-spending bill in the House requires companies to obtain licenses to export even low-powered computers. Bottom line: The proposed rules are the latest flashpoint in a decades-long tussle between computer companies and national security hawks over the best way to limit the export of technology that could end up in enemy weapons. More stories on this topic The dramatic tightening of export regulations is included in the National Defense Authorization Act, an annual military funding bill that has already passed the U.S. House of Representatives. Though the proposed rules are only a tiny portion of the 630-page bill, they could have a devastating impact on the computer industry. "It would bring exports to a grinding halt," said Dan Hoydish, director of trade, public policy and government affairs for Unisys and chairman of the Computer Coalition for Responsible Exports, a trade group that counts many major technology companies as members. "We wouldn't be asking for 20 export licenses in a year, we would be asking for 20,000 in a day." Today, computer sellers are required to get a license to export any computer with performance equal to or greater than a system with 32 Intel Itanium processors. The current version of the defense authorization act would lower that limit to systems deemed "militarily critical" by the Department of Defense. That level is currently set to the equivalent of a computer using a Pentium 3 processor running at 650MHz, state of the art in 1999 but considered feeble today. Moreover, the proposed rules would apply to exports destined for any country, including U.S. allies. The controversial section is not included in a U.S. Senate version of the bill that passed last week. That means the fate of the proposed rules, known as Section 1404, will be determined by negotiations between the House and the Senate, currently slated for later this month. "As the planet shows no sign of nearing the point where nuclear weapons are banned, it is reasonable to assume that current or aspiring nuclear weapons states will vigorously attempt to acquire high-performance computers." --Peter Leitner Defense Department A congressional staff member familiar with the House and Senate bills said it's likely Section 1404 will be changed or dropped. Still, just the specter of passage has rekindled the debate over whether to control the export of computer technologies to other countries. The issue pits the interests of a key U.S. industry against the needs of national security. Though relatively high-performance computers are widespread, lawmakers concerned with national security would still like to block certain countries and terrorist organizations from obtaining them. A representative of the House Armed Services Committee, which drafted the amendment to the original House bill, said the legislation would reverse a trend that has weakened U.S. national security and made the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction much more likely. Supercomputers can be used in nuclear-weapons research, as well as in cryptography, antisubmarine warfare and intelligence activities. "There shouldn't be much daylight between the Department of Defense and Commerce about what requires a license," said Harald Stavenas, spokesman for Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who chairs the House Armed Services Committee. "The problem is that there is. Commerce (isn't controlling) things that have critical military applications." Too relaxed to be vigilant? The performance limits for exported computers, measured in millions of theoretical calculations per second, or MTOPS, have increased almost annually. Eight times in the last two decades, computer companies have won a relaxation in the Department of Commerce's export limit, which began at less than 160 MTOPS in the mid-1980s and has risen to more than 190,000 MTOPS today. That's far more lenient than the 1,500 MTOPS the Department of Defense has deemed threatening to the United States' military superiority, according to the Defense Department's Militarily Critical Technologies List. A report published in 2002 by the U.S. General Accounting Office found that most military applications of computer technology require less than 20,000 MTOPS, including programs used to design and simulate nuclear weapons. A currently exportable computer, such as a 32-processor Intel Itanium computer, could run 98 percent of the applications used by the Department of Defense, the report said. The gap causes many analysts to wonder exactly what the point of export regulations are. The current policy limits the export of computers having a processing power above a certain level to certain countries, including Russia, India, Israel, Pakistan and China. Calculated threat Even modest systems have use in researching weapons of mass destruction; experts estimate that the current export limit of 190,000 million theoretical operations per second (MTOPS) satisfies almost all of the Department of Defense's computing needs.

Further clouding the issue is the recent trend of building highly capable systems by linking scores of relatively off-the-shelf parts, a process known as clustering. Several of those countries whose imports are limited, such as China and Russia, have sidestepped the regulations by creating their own supercomputers using clusters of hundreds or thousands of less-powerful systems. The Top500 list of supercomputers, released last week, included five homegrown Chinese computers, including one ranked No. 10. A Russian supercomputer ranked 391. "The number of clustered systems on that list has really multiplied," said David Rose, director of import/export information security policy for chipmaker Intel, a member of the Computer Coalition for Responsible Exports. "Supercomputers are no longer difficult to create." Moreover, the current export controls, based on a computer's theoretical performance, have widely been criticized as ineffectual and unenforceable. The MTOPS measurement is no longer indicative of a computer's true power and performance, researchers from industry, academia and the General Accounting Office have concluded. Another GAO report found that the Department of Commerce had fallen dangerously behind in its inspections of foreign sites that have purchased U.S. dual-use technology--that with both a commercial and military use--such as supercomputers. And the fact that the current exportable limit far exceeds the amount of processing power needed for military applications has some analysts scratching their heads. "There is no linkage between computing power and military capability any longer; in part because, if you want a bigger computer, you just have to go out and buy a few more clusters," said James Lewis, director of the Technology and Public Policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former export-control negotiator for the U.S. Department of State. "There are so many computers everywhere on earth, that it's impossible to stop." An arms race Not that previous administrations, particularly Ronald Reagan's, haven't tried to control the flow. The proposed rules are the latest battle in a decades-long war between computer companies and national security hawks over the best way to limit the export of technology that could hasten the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The leapfrog race to ever-faster processors has frequently been described as an "arms race." To many worried about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, that's exactly what expanding computer power represents. "As the planet shows no sign of nearing the point where nuclear weapons are banned, it is reasonable to assume that current or aspiring nuclear weapons states will vigorously attempt to acquire high-performance computers to advance their nuclear programs with a degree of covertness hitherto impossible to achieve," Peter Leitner, now the senior strategic trade advisor in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, said in published comments from congressional testimony in 1998. The Defense Department did not make Leitner available to comment for this article. Until 1985, export of any computing systems to a country with a communist government fell under the U.S. Export Administration Act and was generally refused. The rapid growth of the personal computer industry, and the increasing reliance on computer chips manufactured abroad, made "There is no linkage between computing power and military capability any longer; in part because, if you want a bigger computer, you just have to go out and buy a few more clusters." --James Lewis Center for Strategic and International Studies the continued restriction of mass-market computer systems much more difficult, if not impossible. In 1984, the United States reached a pact with Japan, the other major power in the computer chip industry, to regulate the export of high-performance computers under the Supercomputer Control Regime. The United States also used the Coordinating Committee, established in 1949 to limit technology transfer to the Soviet Union, as a forum to set international policy on high-performance computers. With the definition of supercomputers established, the industry quickly started asking for relaxed export regulations. In January 1985, the Department of Commerce decontrolled the first PCs, allowing the export of personal computers such as the IBM PC-XT. Three years later, the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 further relaxed the restrictions to allow any computer under 160 MTOPS to be exported without a license. As computers became more popular and more powerful, pressure continued to mount to ease the export regulations. In 1991, the United States and Japan renewed their agreement and the first Bush administration eased export restrictions to start at 195 MTOPS and higher. That kicked off further easing of restrictions over the next decade. The Clinton administration raised the maximum unlicensed export level five times during its eight years, from 1,500 MTOPS in 1994 to 85,000 MTOPS in 2001. The second Bush administration further raised the limit to 190,000 MTOPS in January 2002. "Mind-boggling" legislation Section 1404 of the appropriations bill would roll back the licensing equation to a level not seen since 1994. "The President shall require a license...for the export of goods or technologies included on the Militarily Critical Technologies List," Section 1404 of the House bill states. That list cites a level of 1,500 MTOPS as being militarily critical. The computer-export issue has already become a talking point in Sen. John Kerry's presidential campaign. Kerry promises that if he's elected president, he'll shift "the emphasis of computer export controls from attempting to control widely available business computers, to controlling the availability of classified software created for applications such as weapons development," according to the Kerry campaign's policy paper. Yet, on that issue, Kerry may not differ much from his opponent. The Bush administration has criticized that part of the legislation in its Statement of Administration Policy for limiting the Executive Branch's power, and listed it as the third most significant problem with the bill. "These requirements are contrary to the president's policy to refine U.S. export control to protect truly critical technologies while facilitating legitimate trade," the position paper stated. The paper, however, did not promise to veto the bill if Section 1404 remained intact, something the Bush administration pledged for its top two concerns outlined in the position paper. "The number of clustered systems on that list has really multiplied. Supercomputers are no longer difficult to create." --David Rose Intel Not only does the White House oppose that section of the legislation, but a representative of the Office of the Secretary of Defense also said it's not likely the Pentagon would support a bill that used the list of critical technologies for export restrictions. The Militarily Critical Technologies List "is not intended to be an export-control list, neither can it function as one," a Defense Department representative said. Some analysts called the restriction a return to Cold War policies. Seymore Goodman, professor of International Affairs and Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the author of two policy papers used by the Clinton administration on the issue, stressed the impossibility of restricting computers that no longer require entire rooms to house them. Now smuggling a few more computer chips to expand a cluster is easy, he said. "If this gets through Congress, it is a regression of mind-boggling proportions," Goodman said. "You cannot control anything that is made by the millions and which you can put in your pocket." Moreover, the rules are unlikely to prevent countries such as Taiwan and China from producing for themselves and selling to other nations computer chips exceeding the 1,500 MTOPS limit. In fact, developing countries such as China may welcome any restriction on U.S. competitors that help its own companies domestically, said Hoydysh of the Computer Coalition for Responsible Exports. "China is busy developing its own industry," he said. "To some extent, the market penetration issues are welcomed by them, because it protects their industry, without dealing with trade issues." Some analysts believe the focus on controlling high-performance computers has hurt national security, diverting resources away from nonproliferation activities that have a higher payoff. If computer exports are no longer controlled, the game is not lost, said Dale Nielson, project leader of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Proliferation and Terrorism Prevention Program. "If people put too much faith in (export controls), then they are closing their eyes to the other things that can be done," he said. "I think that there are enough other critical technologies that can be controlled that people shouldn't see this as a last stance in nonproliferation."
2006-07-11 - Date set for phase 2 of Intel's Core launch    Intel has set the date for the introduction of its next-generation PC chip as it moves forward through one crazy summer. The Core 2 Duo will be unveiled at an event scheduled for July 27 at Intel's headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., a company spokesman confirmed Tuesday. Intel CEO Paul Otellini and other executives will be on hand to unveil the chip that marks the end of Intel's Pentium era. After a six-year run, Intel's Netburst class of processors is on its way out in favor of the new Core chips. The latest chip, the dual-core Pentium D, was fine for many people's needs. But gamers and high-end PC users preferred the performance of Advanced Micro Devices' Athlon 64 X2 chips, and low-end buyers developed a growing interest in AMD's inexpensive chips at the other end of the performance scale. The combination allowed AMD to take the lead among retail PC buyers at points during the last year, although Intel recently regained that mantle. The Core 2 Duo chips will deliver better performance with lower power consumption than the Pentium D chips, Intel has promised. This Thursday, Intel will release reviewers from their nondisclosure agreements and allow them to publish benchmark results that compare the Core 2 Duo and AMD's desktop chips. Earlier this year, Intel said that it expects its Core family of processors to deliver around 20 percent better performance than AMD's chips in the second half of this year. The desktop version of the Core 2 Duo, formerly code-named Conroe, will be the focus of the July 27 event. A notebook version, known as Merom, will follow in August. Last month, Intel introduced its Xeon 5100 processor, the server version of the Core architecture family of chips. "With (Microsoft's Windows) Vista pushed out until 2007, this is a big one for Intel and the OEMs (original equipment manufacturers)," said Bill Kircos, an Intel spokesman, referring to PC companies such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard. Some analysts have expressed concern about the lack of incentives for PC buyers in the second half of the year after Microsoft delayed Vista yet again. Intel's technology is expected to now be the focus of holiday season marketing efforts. Intel also confirmed Tuesday that Montecito, its first dual-core Itanium processor, will launch on July 18, as reported last week.
2003-03-29 - Database due with Windows Server 2003  Microsoft has released the code for its SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition database to manufacturers in time for general availability in late April. The database software, as well as Microsoft's Visual Studio.Net 2003 application development tool, are set for concurrent release with on April 24. SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition will be designed to take advantage of 64-bit hardware based on Intel's Itanium 2 chip.
2003-03-05 - Data centers get cool--literally   Hewlett-Packard is taking a simulation technology out of its labs and using it to help companies cool off equipment-packed data centers, easing the growing adoption of centralized computing. The tech giant launched Tuesday a service that analyzes the air flow in a data center--a facility filled with server, storage and networking systems--to find the best arrangement of computing and air-conditioning gear inside. The service, which uses a complex modeling technology from HP Labs, can cut the energy spent cooling data centers by as much as 25 percent, according to HP. Keeping data centers cool is important because overheated computers can lose data or crash. New technologies, such as server consolidation, are leading banks and other companies to centralize computing operations and to use blade servers and other systems that cram in hot processors ever more densely. Until now, a typical response from data center operators to technology changes such as these has been brute force--bringing in bigger air conditioners, for example. "Most information technology people are not trained in thermodynamics," said Illuminata analyst David Freund. Current data centers--specialized chambers dominated by hulking computer cabinets, uncomfortably chilly air and the roar of hundreds of computer fans--typically have raised floors, under which cool air flows and power lines and networking cables are laid. Cool air is directed upward to computers, though some of it escapes through holes for cables. Intake ducts at the top of the room draw off the heated air and send it to a cooling system. The first version of HP's service is a one-time analysis of a company's data center to give a prescription for the best way to arrange the computing equipment, the flow of cool air into the facility and the flow of hot air out, said Brian Donabedian, an HP site planner and environmental specialist. HP's service uses a technique called computational fluid dynamics to simulate how air flows through a complicated arrangement of ducts, computers and deflectors. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company began showing off the technology behind the analysis service in 2001. Within two years or so, HP will begin offering a more sophisticated second-generation cooling service tied to its Utility Data Center product, said Donabedian. UDC distributes computing jobs across groups of servers and storage systems and can respond to changing workload demands automatically. HP robot helps data keep its cool In this second, "dynamic smart cooling," phase, the UDC control software will be able to move computing work away from hotter areas of a data center or adjust air conditioning systems to deal with hot spots, Donabedian said. It will combine stationary temperature sensors with others mounted on an HP robot patrolling the data center. With the cooling analysis service, HP hopes to boost its attempt to increase revenue from its profitable services group. In the wake of IBM's success in selling services, many computing companies are seeking to earn extra money by offering to help customers install and run complicated computing equipment. The service will appeal only to some large customers initially, Donabedian said. "It is fairly complex, time-consuming and could run into some money," he said. Early customers for the service include the DreamWorks digital animation studio and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which is building a mammoth supercomputer with hundreds of two-processor Itanium servers from HP. The laboratory likely will use the dynamic cooling technology, Donabedian said. Forcing the issue In their earlier days, computers had relatively few processors--the hottest part of a machine--in a large cabinet. But new server models are forcing the cooling issue, said Illuminata's Freund. Rack-mounted and "blade" server models currently fit dozens, or hundreds, of processors in a six-foot rack. In addition, high-end multiprocessor servers from Sun Microsystems already have begun topping the 100-processor mark in a single chassis. Compounding the issues posed by hotter machines is the technology that makes centralized computing more popular. For example, most higher-end Unix servers today can be divided into multiple "partitions," each with its own copy of the operating system. That feature makes it easier to replace numerous widely dispersed low-end servers with a single easy-to-manage large server, a trend called "server consolidation." At the same time, special-purpose storage area networks (SANs) let administrators more easily use large, centralized storage systems instead of smaller ones attached to each server. Rival manufacturers--and their customers--are increasingly looking at the overall cost of running systems, taking into account, for example, electricity charges as well as computer price tags, said Charles King of the Sageza Group analyst firm. "To save money over time, you need to start looking at cooling costs, the cost of doing wiring maintenance, the cost of bringing a server online," King said. "IBM in particular has been really aggressive in the holistic view of the data center." The liquid cooling solution In the long run, adjusting air flow will only help so much with cooling data centers, and more radical changes will be required. The top contender is cooling with water, or some other liquid that's more efficient than air at absorbing heat from processors. This means liquid-cooled systems, such as older IBM mainframes and Cray supercomputers, could experience a renaissance. IBM researchers working on a super-dense storage system called Collective Intelligent Bricks have begun advocating a return to liquid cooling. "We are getting actually feedback from high-end customers who say--about water cooling--'What took you so long to get back to it?'" said IBM researcher Winfried Wilcke in an e-mail interview. While IBM favors centralized water-cooling systems, HP's Donabedian believes smaller, more local cooling also is feasible. It's possible to liquid-cool individual processors or to spray processors with special fluids that can be collected after they cool a chip, then recycled. "Probably within about five years you'll really begin to see liquid cooling hitting the market," Donabedian said. "All the computer manufacturers are going through their gyrations now, experimenting and trying to figure out the best way to go."
2012-06-07 - Customer contact info leaked by HP in case against Oracle  It's been a haphazard week for the security of personal data with major leaks at LinkedIn and now Last.fm. You can add some probably now-unhappy Oracle customers to that list thanks to some legal documents that have popped up in the hardware giant's legal battle against Hewlett-Packard going on right now. As reported by Wired, Oracle received "hundreds of complaints" from customers after the Redwood Shores, Calif.-based company announced it would be discontinuing support for the Itanium processor, making a lot of HP databases rather useless. In a nutshell, that's what started this whole lawsuit in the first place last June. But now, those customers might regret their inquiries for the sole reason that their contact information, including names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers, is included in HP's repertoire of evidence. Thus, they can all be found online and available to the public. Presumably, a lot of these requests are probably coming from business sources and customers, thus they likely don't include a lot of home addresses and personal cell phone numbers. So perhaps one could argue a lot of this information is already available to the public, but now you can just deduce who is (or was) an Oracle customer using an HP server running on Itanium. Nevertheless, no one likes it when their contact information is leaked in any way, so there are bound to be some unhappy clients right now. The case is currently being tried at the Superior Court of the State of California in Santa Clara.This story was originally published as "" on ZDNet's Between the Lines.
2002-10-11 - Court Itanium infringes patents    A federal court ruled Thursday that Intel's Itanium processor violates patents owned by Intergraph and ordered Intel to pay $150 million in damages. The ruling is the culmination of the trial phase of a bitter, multi-issue dispute, dating back to 1997. Huntsville, Ala.-based Intergraph, once a close ally of Intel's in the workstation market, alleged that Itanium, an Intel chip for servers, infringed on designs embodied in two Intergraph patents and in its Clipper processor, a microchip formerly used in Intergraph's workstations. Years ago, a court threw out antitrust complaints filed by Intergraph, and this past April, Intel agreed to pay $300 million to settle claims that its Pentium lines of chips infringed on Intergraph patents. As part of that settlement, the two companies agreed to limit damages in this final phase to $150 million. If Intel appeals the ruling and loses, Intel will pay Intergraph another $100 million. Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said the ruling will not become final for 10 days and the company will ask the judge to reconsider his decision. "Clearly we are disappointed, and we respectfully disagree with the judge's ruling," Mulloy said. If the judge does not reconsider, Mulloy said, Intel plans to appeal, despite the potential $100 million penalty. If Intel were to win an appeal, it would not get the $150 million back, but it would free of having to pay Intergraph a license fee on future Itanium chips. Currently, Intergraph says that for $100 million more, Intel can obtain a license to the disputed patents. Intergraph also says that Intel could redesign its chips, which is likely impractical. "This ruling validates Intergraph's patents, and paves the way for Intergraph's Intellectual Property (IP) Division to actively pursue open licensing with others throughout the consumer-electronics and computer industries," said Intergraph chairman and CEO Jim Taylor in a statement. "We are pleased that the company's long-standing dispute with Intel has concluded with yet another significant return from the company's investment in innovation." Intergraph is also alleging that other companies have infringed on the same patents. The company entered into a licensing agreement with Fujitsu over the patents a few weeks ago, said Intergraph general counsel David Vance Lucas. <="" p=""> "It certainly establishes the legitimacy and value of our patent portfolio," Lucas said in an interview.
2006-04-28 - Course corrections at IBM server group Bill Zeitler may have revived IBM's dominance in the server market. But after last quarter, it's clear he still has some work to do. In nearly six years as leading IBM's systems and technology group, Zeitler helped restore Big Blue's crucial mainframe business, embraced Intel chips and Linux as competitive weapons, launched the industry's top blade server design, and led its Unix systems from a distant third place to the top spot in 2005. But the first quarter of 2006 wasn't so hot for IBM's servers. Mainframe revenue shrank 2 percent and Unix server revenue declined 6 percent, according to Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. IBM's Unix business slumped at the same time that previously down-and-out rival Sun Microsystems couldn't keep up with demand for its newer models. Not only that, but IBM delayed its upcoming Power6 processor into 2007. Zeitler, 58, is preparing his counterattack, though. IBM will cut Unix server prices Tuesday, he said. IBM on Thursday launched a new midrange mainframe in China in an attempt to hook a whole new market on the powerful but pricey machines. And in the longer term, Zeitler sees strong potential for servers using Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron processor. Mainframes--systems with powerful communications ability, flexibility and reliability--had been given up as a relic from an earlier age, but IBM has rejuvenated the line. Its new mainframe, called the System z9 Business Class (BC), is the cheapest mainframe so far. In May it will be available with the z9 Integrated Information Processor, or zIIP, which lets customers run IBM database software without incurring per-processor charges for other software. To reinforce its mainframe modernization and market expansion, Big Blue announced a new Shanghai mainframe development lab working on Linux and other technologies. Zeitler talked about the venerable servers and other priorities in a meeting with CNET News.com's Stephen Shankland. Q: Could you talk about the new midrange mainframes coming out? Zeitler: We're announcing the new system z9 business class mainframe. It brings all of the security, reliability and scale of our traditional mainframe products to a new class of small and medium enterprises at the lowest entry point we've offered. Q: What is that entry point? Zeitler: Well, it's about $100,000. That's considerably below where you would have been able to buy a mainframe traditionally. Q: I suspect they probably aren't too much less expensive to manufacture. So what's the rationale for lowering the price? Zeitler: In fact, the Business Class processors are, from a cost standpoint, better positioned than the traditional z9 processors. We want to be able to offer both midmarket customers and customers in the emerging markets, who are building out their infrastructures, the same kind of reliability and security that traditional buyers have been able to get--without having to pay an enormous financial penalty to get into this product. I think you could fairly well say we shot ourselves in the foot with pSeries in the first quarter. Q: You had some weakness in the mainframe business last quarter. What happened there, and will the new business-class products help fix that? Zeitler: One thing that happened is we didn't close as many large transactions as we had anticipated. We had some particular weakness in the Americas. Beyond that, though, I think that the important point is that we've grown revenue three of the last five years...I expect with the product offerings and some adjustments we've made in our sales approach, we should be able to get this thing back on track going forward. Q: The other soft part of the quarter was pSeries--the Unix market. You managed to get the top spot in the Unix server market in 2005 in terms of revenue. What happened, and what are you going to do to fix that? Zeitler: I think you could fairly well say we shot ourselves in the foot with pSeries in the first quarter. Much of it was around the introduction of our new Power5+ (processor) family of products. Any time you introduce products at the low end that have very strong capabilities, you have some susceptibility to cannibalizing products above them, and that's what happened...We have made some changes relative to that...and I think we'll be in good shape. I don't have any doubt that the new (mid-range Unix servers) are extraordinarily strong technically. We just didn't do the job we needed from marketing and sales positioning. Q: What's happening next Tuesday? Zeitler: We're going to announce some pricing adjustments, some ISV (independent software vendor) incentives and some other positioning things to make these pretty attractive offers--particularly to ISVs and to business partners...who help us to take these product to the market. Q: A couple of years ago, IBM said it expected the Power6 processor to show up this year. Now it's a 2007 phenomenon. I presume that the Power5+ chips will be moving to the high end of the Unix server line sometime later this year. Why did that scheduled slip come about? Zeitler: I think that our CFO, when he (announced) the first-quarter results, said that we expected to have the Power5 plus transition done in the third quarter across the whole line. We have moved the next-generation products into the beginning of next year. Candidly, that gives us time to make sure that we get everything done in the way we need to. The chips coming off of the 65-nanometer (manufacturing process) line are doing wonderfully well, but there's a lot more to this than chips. The other point of it is that the first quarter is a better time to introduce products like this than the fourth. The Power5 and Power5+ families still offer by far the best benchmarks. This is a business judgment, and I think it will prove to be an OK thing to do. Q: Sun has been pretty weak and losing share in the Unix market for a quite a long time now. For once, they actually have pretty strong demand for their new UltraSparc 4+ systems. Are you seeing them as more competitive now, or did they just get lucky with the product cycle? Zeitler: I see more interest in their Opteron-based products. I think that those products offer better competitive choices than at the high end. I don't see them as being of particular competitive challenge, compared to what they have been. But I don't think there's any question that they have adopted Opteron, they have a stronger offer in the market than they did with their traditional offerings. If you look at HP's results over the last few quarters, it wasn't their unit growth that was causing them to improve, it was their average unit revenue. Q: And do you see their UltraSparc T1 "Niagara"-based servers, the T2000 and T1000, in the market at all? Those are pretty new and kind of freaky. Zeitler: Well, at least from my standpoint, we don't see them in competitive situations terribly often. I personally think they'll be a little bit more of a niche product and not something on which I would expect to see them gain a lot of market share. Q: How about the other side of the competition? Hewlett-Packard says Itanium is back. Larry Ellison says Itanium with HP is the most important platform for Oracle. Do you see Itanium systems from HP more often? I don't see anything that could convince me this product is any stronger today than it was six months ago or six years ago. I don't think you see very much of their extension outside of HP's base attacking products that we offer. You have to take these things with some healthy skepticism. Q: You mentioned that the Sun Opteron systems have given them more of a presence in the market. You have Opteron systems--you were the first tier-one manufacturer out of the gate--but you sell them for the high-performance computing niche as opposed to the mainstream server market. What would lead you to change that position? Zeitler: The 64-bit extension offerings from AMD and from Intel (have shown an) unbelievably high rate of take up. That's an indication that what the market was looking for is not another 64-bit architecture like (Itanium), but a rational way to move the x86 architecture from 32 bits forward to 64. It's what makes AMD and the Opteron activities that Sun and HP have been pursuing so important. In that light, we have been looking very, very carefully at what HP has been doing and what Sun's been doing. When we started this, we got a lot of interest from Wall Street clients in particular on using Opteron products for high-performance computing, and so we brought out one new product do that. We followed it with a blade because there's a lot of market there. We've seen really good take up on the Opteron products we've had. What would move us to a (higher-end model) is the continued acceptance of those products from our competitors, and honestly, they are having pretty good success. If you look at HP's results over the last few quarters, it wasn't their unit growth that was causing them to improve, it was their average unit revenue, and the average unit was improving because they had more AMD content than they had had previously. Even in our own case, the average unit revenues on an AMD blade are much higher than the same kind of Intel blade because the performance is better, and because the performance is better, people put more I/O (input-output components such as network cards) and more memory and other things on them. There are a whole bunch of business considerations that would say we would have done better had we had a four-way Opteron product for sure. Q: Does that indicate that you are going to head in that direction? Zeitler: I don't want to speculate when and if we would expand our activities here. But there's no question HP and Sun have benefited by having a broader Opteron portfolio than we've had.
2002-03-05 - Compaq tops in technical computing Compaq Computer edged ahead of rivals in the 2001 high-performance computing market, garnering 23 percent of a $5.1 billion market for computers used to understand problems such as nuclear explosions, car aerodynamics and protein formation. Compaq narrowly edged out Sun Microsystems and IBM, each with 21 percent of the market, and Hewlett-Packard, with 19 percent, according to figures released this week from IDC. "We have four companies competing very aggressively in this market, and it's a very, very tight race," said IDC analyst Chris Willard. "In 2001, Compaq nosed out the competition. However, it came right down to the wire." The high-performance computing market spans computers a notch more powerful than workstations all the way up to multimillion-dollar supercomputers. While it's not the biggest slice of the computing market, it's important because the cutting-edge machines are an indication of the future technological strength of more mainstream designs. Compaq also led in 2000, but the margin was slim then, too. "The differences between the top four players are minimal," separated merely by the revenue a company could earn in a good month of sales, Willard said. The total worldwide market dropped 16 percent from $6.1 billion in 2000 to $5.1 billion in 2001, Willard said. However, IDC expects midsingle-digit percentage growth in 2002. "We are predicting a return to positive growth this year," he said, based in part on strong sales in the fourth quarter. Indeed, those fourth-quarter sales were what allowed Compaq to unseat Sun, which was top-ranked for the first nine months of 2001. Compaq was helped through the recession by government buyers, traditionally the largest segment of the company's sales, said Ty Rabe, director of high-performance technical computing solutions at Compaq. "The government spending has been a stable point in the recent turbulent time," with some buying spurred by increased security concerns. The private sector now is picking up somewhat as well. "We're not seeing a huge surge, but we're recovering from the post-Sept. 11 trauma," he said. Compaq, with its respected Alpha chip, has been strong in the high-performance market. But the company is putting an end to the Alpha line with a plan to move to Intel's Itanium chip family instead. In 2005, Itanium systems will be preferable in terms of performance, he said. But switching to the new chip will require customers to rewrite software that Itanium can understand. The customers include organizations such as national laboratories that write their own programs as well as companies that sell their software to others. Biosciences companies, which use supercomputers to try to decode genetic information, predict protein formation, and design new drugs, have now matched government customers in spending, Rabe said. Compaq expects that ultimately biosciences will move ahead and account for half of Compaq's high-performance computing sales. Compaq apparently is different from the overall industry, though. IDC predicts life sciences to account for 30 percent of sales by 2005.
2001-02-13 - Compaq releases Alpha chip amid brighter prospects Compaq Computer released a new version of its Alpha processor for servers on Monday amid signs that the outlook for the chip is improving. The new Alpha 21264 runs at 833MHz and will be included in Compaq's AlphaServer ES 40 line of servers, complex machines that sell for tens of thousands of dollars and up. Some customers, including biotechnology companies, already had access to early versions of the server. Today's announcement, however, signals the beginning of general commercial availability. The chip is roughly 18 months late, but, in the overall context of the high-end server market, that's not a big deal. Sun's UltraSparc III processor arrived on the market approximately a year after its original due date. Intel's Itanium processor was originally going to appear toward the middle of 1999; Itanium servers now are due this quarter, but further delays could occur, sources have said. "It's sort of a contest to see who could fall behind the least," said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64. Just as importantly, Alpha has begun to experience firmer traction in the marketplace. Originally designed by Digital, the Alpha chip for years was considered an example of state-of-the-art technology that few people wanted to buy. The chip, and servers based around it, won a dedicated core of customers that remained small in number. Compaq acquired the chip as part of its purchase of Digital in 1998. Since then, the technology's early death has often been predicted. But rather than fade away, the chip has actually experienced growth. The Houston-based computer maker saw 17 percent growth in revenue in its business critical server unit in 2000, with two-thirds of the unit's revenue coming from Alpha servers. In the first half, Ericsson will commercially release its first telecommunications switches containing Alpha chips, according to Rick Frazier, vice president of business critical servers at Compaq. It's a new market for Alpha, he said, and more deals could follow. Additionally, "We've landed six of the last seven major supercomputer contracts," Frazier said. The renewed interest in the platform has come partly from a narrower sales strategy engineered by Compaq CEO Michael Capellas, he said. Instead of targeting the entire server market, Compaq refined its strategy to focus only on select sub-segments, such as the supercomputer market or for e-business customers using Oracle applications. This made it easier to concentrate on deals that the company stood a good chance of winning. "The general-purpose marketplace is under attack from the world," Frazier said. "The fact that we are the only major computer in the computing industry that has a CEO who did tour of duty as a chief information officer has helped." Compaq also saw sales recover in the middle of 2000 with the release of the first "Wildfire," or GS class Alpha servers. The servers were delayed earlier by component shortages, according to Terry Shannon, editor of the Terry Knows Compaq newsletter. While sales failed to meet earlier projections for the year, Compaq still managed to sell $800 million worth of GS servers. Although analysts say it is too early to declare that the war is won, the company is making progress. "Alpha continues to get good market share for its technology. They are still doing very well with the established customers," Brookwood said. "To Compaq's credit, there were many who thought that when Compaq acquired Digital, Alpha would be one of the first things to go." The 833MHz Alpha is the first new Alpha chip since a 733MHz version was announced last year. Despite the one-year hiatus, more activity is coming. A 1GHz version of the 21264, originally due at the end of 1999, is being made in samples right now, said Shannon. "They are getting the chips in volume from IBM right now," he said. IBM serves as Compaq's manufacturer. News about the 21364, the successor to the 21264, should also begin to emerge, he said. The chip, which contains a Rambus controller, was originally slated for the middle of 2000.
2001-03-15 - Compaq races to release ultradense servers Compaq Computer is sharpening its strategy to cram as many servers into as little space as possible, planning to release an "ultradense" server design code-named QuickBlade later this year. With current server designs, 42 computers with 82 CPUs can be bolted into a six-foot rack. But ultimately, the ability to stuff as many as 200 or even 300 CPUs into a single rack will help slake the "insatiable demand for servers" at large companies and computing service providers, Mary McDowell, general manager of Compaq's Intel server division, said in an interview. These ultradense servers are a key part of the server strategy not only of Compaq, but also IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Intel. The trick to very high density is mounting several of the electronics boards of CPUs inside one enclosure, like books in a bookcase. But IBM got ahead in the skinny server game by licensing a two-processor, 1.75-inch thick design from Network Engines. "IBM captured the idea that people might want thin servers," said Illuminata analyst Jonathan Eunice. This time, Compaq hopes to gain the lead. Compaq's ultradense servers will arrive late this year, McDowell said. Tom Bradicich, IBM's top Intel server designer, said his company's servers won't be the first on the market. Compaq has numbers on its side. While IBM is a trusted name in data centers staffed by conservative computer technicians, Compaq ships more servers than any other company. According to IDC figures released Wednesday, Compaq sold 1.1 million servers in 2000. The nearest competitor, IBM, sold 608,000. Though the QuickBlade design is Compaq's own, Intel hopes to help all computer makers build ultradense servers. Intel will offer hardware using its low-power CPUs originally designed for laptop computers for its ultradense designs. Intel servers are a good match for ultradense designs from a financial point of view. Intel's high-volume production enables it to sell CPUs more cheaply than competing chips from rivals such as Sun Microsystems. However, HP has its own "bladed" designs coming using its own PA-RISC chips, said Scott Hudson, worldwide marketing manager for HP's Unix server line. And companies such as RLX Technologies and FiberCycle are using Transmeta's low-power chips. The problem with using Transmeta is that more engineering work is required to fit the nonstandard chips into computer designs, McDowell said. Ultradense phase two: InfiniBand Like IBM, McDowell believes the InfiniBand connection technology will mean further developments for ultradense servers. With InfiniBand, several computing nodes can be tied together while systems for communicating with storage and network resources are located elsewhere. "We have been ramping up our InfiniBand efforts," she said. Compaq hopes to differentiate its QuickBlade design from other ultradense products by packaging it with high-end storage systems and Compaq management software, McDowell said. Customers will be able to buy pre-assembled--and doubtless higher-profit-margin--collections of these products. "It's a terrific opportunity to start selling by the rack," McDowell said. While Compaq believes most of its business will be with ultradense servers and other efforts to "scale out" computing jobs across numerous smaller computers, the company also is banking on "scaling up" jobs on single, ultrapowerful servers. The company will release an eight-processor server based on Intel's Foster chips--the Xeon version of the Pentium 4. Customers with the current eight-processor ProLiant 8500 servers will be able to upgrade to the new CPUs, she said. And in late 2002 or early 2003, Compaq plans to release a 32-processor server using Intel's McKinley chip. McKinley is the second-generation offering in Intel's high-end 64-bit line. Intel has yet to launch its much-delayed Itanium chip, the first in the 64-bit line. Compaq is ready with its Itanium machines, McDowell said. "When they (Intel) say go, we'll start shipping our products," she said, adding that the revenue will be small enough that it won't be material to the company's business when the shipments begin.
2001-06-25 - Compaq narrows server-chip competition And then there were three. Compaq Computer's announcement Monday that it will use Intel's Itanium chips in its high-end servers and transfer its Alpha chip expertise to Intel represents a dramatic overhaul of the market. As a result, just three major 64-bit chip designs are left to compete: Intel's Itanium, Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc and IBM's Power. Because Compaq's Alpha-based server business is in a distant fourth place compared with the Unix server lines from No. 1 Sun, No. 2 Hewlett-Packard and No. 3 IBM, Compaq's decision to rework its high-end server products is probably more important for Intel and Sun than for Compaq. Among the effects:Intel's Itanium efforts could benefit from new, experienced employees--but Sun and IBM also have an opportunity to snare Alpha designers. The underpinnings of Alpha, UltraSparc and Power--a technology called reduced instruction set computing (RISC)--has just received a vote of no confidence, boosting the prospects of Itanium's very long instruction word (VLIW) design and putting more pressure on Sun.Compaq's server-design employees will be able to unify products behind a single chip. "This makes an interesting dynamic, particularly for IBM and Sun being left as the only major RISC suppliers in the market," Gartner analyst George Weiss said Monday. "It raises more issues about whether RISC is in it for the long haul." Although IBM has hedged its bets by firmly backing both Power- and Itanium-based servers, Sun has derided Itanium as a "weird architecture" and insists its own UltraSparc design still has a glorious future before it. "All these architectures are converging gradually," said Shahin Khan, head of marketing for Sun's server products. In addition, Khan said, Sun will be able to improve its chips without requiring software companies to completely rewrite their software. On the other hand, Sun's competitors will be able to focus solely on designing servers, while Sun also must worry about designing the chips. "You wonder how long Sun will be able to do that before business or economics force their hand," Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood said. Boosting Itanium RISC, which dates back to the 1980s, may have longevity problems. But Itanium, which was launched in May, hasn't even begun struggling through adolescence. The first generation of Itanium was delayed by years, and even Intel said the second-generation "McKinley" version will be the first with potential for use beyond just test servers. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's longtime rival, won't debut its first 64-bit chip to compete with Itanium until late this year. The deal with Compaq has the potential to improve Intel's track record, though, because Compaq not only has expertise in chip design, but also in the creation of "compiler" software, which plays an increasingly important role in creating programs that take advantage of chip features. Under the deal announced Monday, Intel will incorporate Compaq technology to give an "essence of Alpha" to future Itanium designs, said Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel Architecture Group. But some believe Intel won't get all it hopes out of the Compaq design staff. "Frankly, I don't think they're going to get much," said Linley Group analyst Linley Gwennap. "Most of the good Alpha engineers have already left. If they haven't already, most aren't going to be interested in working with Intel." The only other time Intel acquired a design team originally, from Digital Equipment--the 25-person StrongARM group under Rich Whitek--"the whole team walked out," Gwennap said. Compaq Stock price from June 2000 to present. Source: Prophet Finance Regardless of design issues, Itanium likely will prevail on its business merits, Gwennap said, because so many server makers back the chip design. "At this point there's so much momentum behind the Itanium platform that it's hard to see how anybody's going to stand up against that," he said. One feature that could be useful for Itanium is "symmetric multi-threading," a process Compaq said would debut in the Alpha EV8 design. Symmetric multi-threading increases the efficiency of a chip by letting it work on more tasks in parallel. Another is better features on the chip for creating multiprocessor servers, said MicroDesign Resources analyst Cary Snyder. But symmetric multi-threading, like the VLIW design in Itanium, isn't much good without support from compiler software, Snyder said. Indeed, Intel is eager to put the Alpha compiler programmers to work. "We're hoping to get the compiler team (together) as quickly as possible," Otellini said. "They'll work on the overall (Itanium) compiler technology" and on bringing Compaq's operating Tru64, OpenVMS and NonStop Himalaya operating systems to Itanium. Sun also is interested in attracting some Alpha designers. "This strengthens what has already been a recruitment opportunity," said Khan, adding that Sun has chip design centers near Boston and Austin, Texas, where Compaq Alpha and IBM Power chips are designed, respectively. "We can bet that (Sun CEO Ed) Zander (and IBM COO) Sam Palmisano are going to vie for these engineers," Giga Information Group analyst Brad Day said. Compaq's experienced chip designers will be "naming their price." Cultural issues could be an obstacle preventing Intel from picking up all the Alpha designers, Snyder added. "What kind of toll the religious war will take remains to be seen. Now is a good time to motivate people with some really good low-cost stock options," he said. Whither Compaq technology? The change in Compaq's server designs is significant for its customers and for companies that sell software for Compaq servers. Switching from Alpha to Itanium will mean major work in programming and testing to see whether software and hardware work properly. The transition from MIPS chips to Alpha chips in Compaq's highest-end Tandem servers already has been a five-year process, with the first Tandem Alpha systems expected in 2003. But Compaq asserts the transition is worth it. When the company approached a number of large customers to test their reception to switching from Alpha to Itanium, the response "exceeded our expectations," said Mike Winkler, Compaq's executive vice president of global business units. Meta Group says if Compaq's announcement to emphasize software and services indicates management is finally making the decisions it has so far avoided, then it's a good sign. see commentary "For the first time, they can see a constant migration and growth path that had always been a question--whether Alpha could continue to grow," he said. "What we found mattered to customers was not Alpha but the operating environment--Tru64 and OpenVMS. They didn't really care which chip." Sun, though, prides itself on how older software works on newer systems and asserts that Compaq's latest transition will create more sales of Sun servers. "This will accelerate (sales) of Alpha replacement systems," Khan said, predicting that future hurdles would afflict the transition to Itanium. Analysts--many of whom have been asking for years when the Alpha line will be phased out--were nearly universal in the opinion that it's a smart deal for Compaq. "In our view, Alpha was the albatross around Compaq's neck. And in this environment, it is just too much of a luxury to support," Buckingham Research analyst Peter Labe said in a research note Monday. "Compaq should save hundreds of millions in costs, focus its research more intensely, and simplify its go-to-market message to supporting just a single-server architecture." Under the deal, Compaq will boost the speed of its current EV6 Alpha design twice more while preparing the release of its EV7 design. The EV8 team will work on Itanium instead, the companies said. "This is a commitment to ensure our customers...have a very clear, compelling road map that ends up in a great place," Compaq Chief Executive Michael Capellas said. The Alpha EV7 refresh "will be the end of the line," Winkler said. "We will then migrate to the Itanium architecture for all the Compaq server platforms." Weiss said the effect on Sun "wouldn't be evident until the 2003-2004 time frame. Just when depends on how quickly these technologies that Compaq contributes to Intel makes its way into the Itanium architecture. We don't believe that probably will happen until 'Madison,'" the chip due after McKinley. "So we're talking about 2004 or 2005 when Sun and possibly IBM need to be concerned about the growing dominance of Intel in the high-end server space." HP conceived of Itanium more than a decade ago and approached Intel in the early 1990s to build it so the design wouldn't be relegated to the small, high-end market its PA-RISC chips occupy. The company has been selling Unix servers since 1999 that can accommodate second-generation Itanium chips, and the last PA-RISC design, the 8900, is scheduled to be released in 2004, said Mark Hudson, worldwide marketing manager for HP servers. After that, it's Itanium all the way. HP is glad to have Compaq engineers to hasten the Itanium improvements and to impart more momentum to the chip. "Welcome to the club. This endorses what we've been saying for a long time: Itanium is inevitable," Hudson said. "It's the next-generation architecture for the next 15 to 20 years." The company is years ahead of Compaq in designing Itanium servers. But with Compaq's Intel server business much stronger than HP's at present, Compaq's change puts more pressure on HP's server division at a time when it is weak. "HP obviously worked closely with Intel on Itanium, and you would think they would be the preferentially treated vendor," said Technology Business Research analyst Lindy Lesperance. "But this turns everything around in favor of Compaq, which offers invaluable technology." Lesperance said that "Compaq's aggressive migration" will put "pressure on HP to expedite their Itanium migration strategy." Staff writer John Spooner contributed to this report.
2001-06-25 - Compaq Life after Alpha    Compaq Computer's announcement on Monday to license its Alpha chip technology to Intel signals the end of the line for the chip--once hailed as the fastest on the planet. Intel will begin channeling some Alpha technology and engineering talent toward its recently introduced line of Itanium processors, and Compaq will turn exclusively to the Intel chip to power its servers--paring down expenses, consolidating its product lines, and beginning a shift to software and services. The Alpha will be no more by 2004. Originally designed by Digital Equipment, the Alpha was for years considered an example of state-of-the-art technology that few people wanted to buy. The first Alpha chip shipped in 1992, running at a record-breaking 200MHz. The 64-bit chip was engineered to run multiple operating systems--Unix in addition to Microsoft's Windows NT--and was expected to have a life span of 25 years, according to historical information on Compaq's Web site. Alpha was also the first mass-produced chip to reach a clock speed of 1GHz, back in 1999. The chip--and servers based on it--won a dedicated core of customers, but it was expensive, and finding software applications to run on the Alpha was a constant struggle for its users. Because of low sales of Alpha systems, Microsoft stopped shipping a version of Windows NT for the chip architecture in 1999. Compaq acquired the chip as part of its purchase of Digital in 1998. After that, the technology's death was often predicted, as more-popular chip architectures gradually caught up to, and finally surpassed, the Alpha's performance level. Given the history of the chip, the decision to discontinue it wasn't easy, said Compaq executives. But it was necessary for the company's bottom line. And aside from the cost of maintaining the chip--at least several hundred million dollars per year--Compaq executives said the chip was running out of steam. "I think there was a growing feeling--not just inside Compaq--that a lot of these RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architectures (such as the Alpha) were running out of runway," said Mike Winkler, Compaq's executive vice president of global business units. "As we continued to work with Intel...there was a kind of mutual epiphany that said (the Itanium's) price-performance...is really reaching the point where it eclipses the RISC architecture we're using today." "As you get to next-generation processors with smaller and smaller die sizes," Winkler said, referring to new manufacturing processes, "it becomes more and more expensive exponentially to continue to invest in this architecture over time." "It was a very pragmatic business decision, and it was very much about price-performance, commonality...scalability...and every customer we've talked to so far has been positive," said Winkler. Compaq's decision came to a head after the results of an exhaustive study conducted by the company were made available to Compaq brass, according to analyst and company follower Terry Shannon. "Within four years or less, Compaq no longer would be able to maintain performance differentiation on the Alpha chip," Shannon wrote in the latest edition of his newsletter "Shannon Knows Compaq." "In light of cost-reduction efforts now underway throughout Compaq, the substantial investment required to develop and deploy future Alpha processor designs became extremely difficult to justify," wrote Shannon. "Hence, the researchers carefully examined a number of 'Life After Alpha' business scenarios." Translation: Alpha, the chip once hailed as the most advanced on the planet, is now an also-ran. Compaq realized "the then current Alpha chip--its EV8--would not have a significant performance advantage" over Itanium, Shannon said. So the company began the long process by which it will phase out the chip. While it populates its product lines with Itanium processors, Compaq will finish development work on two future versions of the Alpha chip, including its chips code-named EV68 and EV7, which will offer 1GHz and faster speeds. The Alpha EV68 will be available this summer in Compaq's AlphaServer GS, at speeds of 1GHz, the company said. Meanwhile, the EV7 is planned to ship later this year at speeds of 1.2GHz and later 1.6GHz, Shannon said. Compaq said it will use the EV7 in an AlphaServer model planned for next year. While analysts such as Shannon lamented the loss of the once mighty chip, they say that Compaq did help to ease the process: The company notified customers ahead of time, essentially giving them three years before the Alpha is phased out and Itanium becomes the chip of choice. "All in all, customers should have nothing to fear," Shannon said. "As a longtime Alpha advocate, I'm saddened Alpha is going away." However, "I know some of the very large customers I have talked to are happy." Shannon expects "there will be a lot of Alpha technology incorporated into (Intel's Itanium) designs." He speculates that Alpha's "glueless SMP" and EV8's SMT, or simultaneous multi-threading technologies, would make their way into future Itanium chips. Intel's involvement with Alpha goes back to the settlement of a patent lawsuit between Intel and Digital in 1998. As part of the settlement, Intel purchased Digital's StrongARM processor, along with the Hudson, Mass., manufacturing plant where the StrongARM--and the Alpha--were produced. At the same time, Samsung, IBM and Advanced Micro Devices were granted licenses for the Alpha. IBM now manufactures some Alpha processors for Compaq, while Samsung produces the rest. A marketing organization--dubbed Alpha Processor Inc.--was formed. The company is now known as Alpha Networks and is diversifying its horizons in working with other chipmakers, such as AMD.
2001-06-25 - Compaq Intel boost Itanium in chip deal    In a major boost to Intel's Itanium chip, Compaq Computer will license its Alpha chip technology to Intel and will use Itanium in its servers as the PC giant looks to consolidate its operations to focus on software and computer services. Intel, through the Alpha deal, will gain valuable intellectual property from Compaq for use in its chips and a major customer for its Itanium processor. As part of the deal, Compaq will eventually transition all of its server systems to use Itanium processors. "We are standardizing on the Itanium family of 64-bit" processors, Compaq CEO Michael Capellas said during a news conference Monday morning. "This is going to be one-microprocessor architecture under our entire server line." Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The companies said the deal is a nonexclusive licensing agreement. Intel will hire the majority of Alpha engineers, some of whom will remain at Compaq until they complete AlphaServer projects now under way. No layoffs are expected as a result of the deal, a Compaq executive said. Compaq will transfer the majority of its Alpha development tools and engineering resources to Intel, which also will be granted licenses to use Alpha processor technology and compilers. As part of the agreement, Compaq said it will move its entire line of 64-bit servers to Itanium microprocessors by 2004. The deal, however, will not prevent Compaq's releasing its long-anticipated, next-generation Alpha processor known as EV7. The company also will continue designing and building NonStop Himalaya servers, which use MIPS chips, until 2004. For Intel the deal is "obviously a major victory in the sense that...eventually all Compaq's 64-bit stuff will be Itanium-based," said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight64. Brookwood said Compaq "could have kept (Alpha) going, but at least here they're going out in a very orderly manner, which benefits everybody. It's sort of a death with dignity" for Alpha. Intel CEO Craig Barrett said in a news conference Monday morning that the Alpha technology won't affect Intel's "silicon chip technology for a few years. Probably the area where it will have the more immediate impact is compiler technology and using some of the compiler expertise that Compaq currently has to put that to greater parallelism to our product's multi-threading capability." Gartner analyst George Weiss said with the additional technology and commitment from Compaq, "Intel becomes empowered and will progress up the food chain quicker as it gets the talent and the engineering resources working on Itanium, not only from Compaq but also HP." Hewlett-Packard has already said it will phase out its high-end chip architecture in favor of Itanium chips. Compaq also agreed to port its Tru64 Unix, OpenVMS and NonStop Kernel operating systems to Itanium. At the same time, Compaq and Intel agreed to jointly develop future high-end computing products. Capellas rebuffed concerns that the deal could raise regulatory issues. "We've obviously looked at it pretty carefully, and we don't believe there are any regulatory roadblocks that may fall," he said. "Quite frankly, this is nonexclusive, so we believe this is just an extension of competition in the marketplace." Barrett echoed Capellas' sentiments, noting that Intel had "no discussions with anyone in the Bush administration." He reiterated that it is "a nonexclusive arrangement. We're getting a license for Compaq intellectual property." Originally designed by Digital Equipment, the Alpha chip for years was considered an example of state-of-the-art technology that few people wanted to buy. The chip, and servers based on it, won a dedicated core of customers that remained small in number. Compaq acquired the chip as part of its purchase of Digital in 1998. Compaq looks to services The deal is part of a larger plan by Compaq to offset sluggish PC sales and a slowing economy by moving away from hardware and focusing its efforts on software and services. In an internal memo to employees dated June 12, Chief Executive Michael Capellas outlined a new strategy to transform Compaq. Calling it a "major shift" for the company, Capellas said the goal is to make Compaq "the leading IT solutions provider," zeroing in on a way to deliver software, products and services to its customers. Wall Street analysts have been expecting some sort of restructuring from Compaq. And at investment conferences, Capellas has said the company will begin to focus more on services. Compaq's new approach mirrors what IBM has done for years as one of the largest services organizations in the industry with its own operation, IBM Global Services. IBM expects high-single-digit sales growth and double-digit earnings growth in the current fiscal year, which will primarily be driven by its booming services business. About half of Big Blue's total revenue growth from the first quarter came from services. The company intends to make the changes over the next 180 days and plans to develop a "solutions organization" dedicated to the new strategy, according to the memo, obtained by CNET News.com. The division will initially help customers in the telecommunications and financial services industries, but eventually Compaq will target companies in health care, life sciences, media and manufacturing. After its failed bid last month to acquire Net consulting company Proxicom, Compaq has said its mission is to continue seeking out acquisitions to quickly grow its services side. In the memo, Capellas noted that Compaq has allocated $500 million for these acquisitions. As part of the transformation strategy, Compaq also plans to reduce structural costs by $200 million per quarter, which includes a 20 percent decrease in manufacturing costs by the end of the year. "Our goal is to increase services from about one-fifth of Compaq's revenue today to one-third of total company revenue during the next three or four years," Capellas wrote in the memo. "To get there, we will need to grow about 40 percent per year through a combination of internal growth, acquisitions and increased software sales." Staff writer John G. Spooner contributed to this report.
2001-11-28 - Compaq gets fix for Itanium servers    Intel has issued new software that fixes a problem that held up the release of Compaq Computer's first Itanium servers. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based giant has come out with a new BIOS (basic input/output system) for its Itanium chip that resolves a problem Compaq recently discovered with its ProLiant 590/64 server, which contains the chip. Earlier this month, Compaq determined that its Itanium servers did not pass its internal testing procedures. The problem, Compaq claimed, was caused by the processor and also affected servers from other manufacturers. Compaq consequently halted shipments of its machines. During an investigation by both companies, it was determined that the problem lay in its BIOS, a mandatory software interface between the hardware and operating system. Intel created a new BIOS to fix the problem, a spokesman said. Intel is now recommending that all manufacturers adopt the new BIOS. The problem, earlier termed a "sighting," is not a bug, the spokesman added. Intel will also not have to alter the design of Itanium to cure the problem. Itanium, co-developed by Intel and Hewlett-Packard, is designed to power servers that will compete against machines from Sun Microsystems. Originally due in the mid- to late 1990s, the chip came out commercially in May 2001. Partly because of the delays and partly because of performance, most server manufacturers have barely marketed servers featuring the first version of the chip and are concentrating on the next version, code-named McKinley, which comes out later this year in pilot systems. Commercial versions of McKinley servers will debut in mid-2002.
2001-04-30 - Compaq dumps Unisys from server line   In a major blow to a Unisys plan to make its high-end servers a standard part of many company's product lines, Compaq Computer has joined Hewlett-Packard in canceling a deal to sell the powerful Unisys computers. The Unisys "Cellular Multiprocessing" (CMP) server, which can house as many as 32 Intel processors, is the cornerstone of Unisys' strategy to have other companies sell its products under their own names. The Blue Bell, Penn., company had signed up Compaq for the program first, then Dell Computer and HP. But Compaq decided to spend its marketing and customer support money in a more lucrative, lower-end segment of the market for servers running Microsoft's Windows operating system, said Mary McDowell, general manager of Compaq's Intel server line. It's a major setback for Unisys, an old-line computing company that had been depending on the CMP server to help raise its profile during trying times. The company's revenue grew from $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2000 to $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2001, but its net income dropped from $107 million to $69 million. Unisys representatives didn't immediately comment on the change. Compaq said eight-processor systems had much more appeal to large corporate customers building "data centers" stuffed full of computers. "As we were aggressively moving after the data center market, 95 percent of them were landing on eight-way computers. The right business decision was to focus sales and support around the ProLiant eight-way," she said. Compaq will stop selling the Unisys system on May 31. Earlier this month, Duane Zitzner, head of HP's computing group, said earlier this month that his company wouldn't even begin selling it. That means the only companies selling the 32-processor system are Dell and Unisys itself, which markets the product under the name ES7000. Earlier, company representatives expected sales partners such as Compaq to sell most of the systems, with two-thirds of CMP revenue coming from other companies. At the beginning of March, Unisys itself had sold 320 of the systems. Unisys also is hoping to sell the CMP systems running its mainframe operating systems, a business that's declining not just for Unisys but also for mainframe market leader IBM. Meanwhile, HP and Compaq are working on high-end Intel server designs of their own. Compaq is planning an eight-processor server based on Intel's coming Xeon processor--a high-end version of the Pentium 4. It's also building a 32-processor system using "McKinley," the code name for the second-generation Itanium chip with which Intel hopes to conquer even higher-end server markets. HP, which co-developed the Itanium chip line but expected it to arrive much earlier, said it had chosen to focus its attention on designing its own Itanium systems instead of Unisys' CMP systems. The CMP systems are designed to accommodate the Itanium line, a totally different chip design from Intel's current products. Unisys also is designing a successor called CMP2 that could accommodate 64 CPUs later, the company said. One problem with the 32-processor systems is that software generally works better on eight-processor systems, McDowell said. It's difficult to get software--operating systems such as Windows or Linux or higher-level software such as databases--to be able to take advantage of all the CPUs in a large multiprocessor server. "Most of the applications, from the performance standpoint, are best served on an eight-way platform," McDowell said. Customers who bought CMP systems with more than eight processors typically "partitioned" them into several systems, each with eight processors, she said. The Unisys servers were a key part of Microsoft's launch last September of its highest-end operating system, Windows 2000 Datacenter. This version, designed to be more reliable and faster than its lower-end brethren, can work on systems with as many as 32 processors.
2001-02-05 - Compaq cuts back on size power with new servers    Later this year, Compaq Computer will jump into the nascent market for tiny servers that use less power and take up less space than current products. The Houston-based computing giant plans to release "hyper-dense" servers sometime this year, Mary McDowell, general manager of Compaq's Industry Standard Server Group, said Monday at the Banc of America Securities Conference in San Francisco. These servers will be smaller than Compaq's current dense servers, which measure 1.75 inches thick. Additionally, these new computers will cut down on "cable density," the tangle of wires that stick out of the back. "We've been on a Calista Flockhart sort of trend where the servers get skinnier and skinnier," McDowell said, referring to the "Ally McBeal" star. When it comes to servers, size matters. In the recent past, large corporations would largely depend on a few bulky servers containing a multitude of processors to run their computing operations. Now, ASPs (application service providers) and e-commerce companies are installing hundreds of single- and dual-processor servers to run their businesses. Compaq's line of dense DL ProLiant servers, for instance, went from 20 percent of the company's server product mix to 40 percent in 2000, McDowell pointed out. While this makes it easier to add or subtract overall computing power, the method of "scaling out" back-end operations has created a number of logistical problems. ASPs have to lease more real estate to house their multiple server racks, while the energy required to run them has raised utility bills. Heat is also a problem. ASPs are forced to install complex cooling systems that would be more at home in a meat-packing plant. McDowell would not provide many technical details or comment on when Compaq plans to come out with its hyper-dense servers. However, she did state that the new servers would come out of her group, which focuses on Intel-based servers primarily running Windows or Linux. A number of start-ups are also working on similar server designs based on Crusoe processors from Transmeta. RLX Technologies, for instance, plans to come out with a Transmeta server in the first half of this year that will use far fewer cables than standard servers. RLX's "Razor" server weighs much less than current servers. The company has Compaq connections. Gary Stimac, a Compaq founder and the executive largely credited with creating the company's server strategy, became RLX's CEO in December. Other RLX employees include Mike Perez, who at one time was McDowell's boss. He will serve as vice president of technology. The coming year should be fairly active for Compaq's server division, McDowell added. The company expects to sell 1.3 million to 1.4 million Intel-based servers, up from 1 million in 2000. Compaq also managed to sell $1 billion worth of eight-processor servers, a product category that until recently seemed stuck in neutral. In the first half, Compaq will come out with the first servers containing "Foster," a version of the Pentium 4 for servers and workstations. Compaq will also make its own chipset, a set of companion chips for the processor, for its Foster servers. Intel is not making a Foster chipset, McDowell said. Several sources, however, have said ServerWorks, which was recently bought by Broadcom, is making a Foster chipset. This year the market will also see the first commercially available versions of servers containing Itanium, the long-delayed 64-bit chip from Intel. "Compaq is the only vendor to develop our own Itanium-based server," she said. Most other computer makers, sources have said, are using a design engineered by Intel. Itanium was originally due in the middle of 1999. Complications in the design process, however, pushed back the release. Prototype servers started to go to corporate customers in the fall of 2000. While she wouldn't commit to a release date, she said sales would be limited. "We don't anticipate a significant volume of Itanium servers this year," she said. In 2002, Compaq will release a server containing 32 "McKinley" processors, she said. McKinley, due in limited samples at the end of this year, is the second version of Intel's Itanium processor.
2002-07-08 - Companies pledge support for Itanium 2 Microsoft, Unisys, several Linux developers and a host of other high-tech companies pledged their allegiance to Intel's Itanium 2 processor this week but generally acknowledged that their products for the processor won't roll out overnight. Microsoft will start to come out with an Itanium 2 version of Windows Advanced Server next month but won't issue a version of Windows XP for workstations until the first quarter of 2003. Windows.Net enterprise and data-center servers for Itanium will ship to manufacturers this year but likely won't be in customers' hands until next year. UnitedLinux, a consortium of Linux developers that includes SuSE and Turbolinux, said a version of the Linux OS designed to run on a variety of Itanium 2 machines will come out in the second half of the year. SGI, NEC, Unisys and European computer manufacturer Bull also announced that they will build Itanium 2 products, with most arriving later this year. Hewlett-Packard, which co-designed the architecture behind Itanium 2, unfurled the details behind its Itanium servers and workstations, but these machines won't come out until August. Itanium 2, a chip for high-end servers and workstations that has been in development at Intel for years, will compete against chips such as IBM's Power 4 and Sun's UltraSparc line that go into servers that cost anywhere from $25,000 to well over $1 million. Unlike the PC market, where new chips get released and absorbed into the marketplace fairly rapidly, the server market moves relatively slowly. Hardware manufacturers and software developers test new processors for extended periods to ensure against flaws. Corporations, university labs and other buyers also spend considerable amounts of time and energy kicking the tires on new products. "You'll see the first (Itanium 2 software) come out midyear and trail through the first part of 2003," said Lisa Hambrick, director of enterprise processor marketing at Intel. And the announcements are unlikely to be accompanied by the kind of fanfare PC chips enjoy. "It's not like everyone stands onstage and has a big shrimp fest." The adoption rate is further slowed by the fact that Itanium is a relatively young chip family, so there are very few existing products from which to learn. The first Itanium chips only started selling in May 2001. Nonetheless, the process has begun. Graphics chipmakers Nvidia and ATI Technologies said they have adapted drivers for their chips to work with Itanium 2. Hewlett-Packard will use Nvidia's chips in its workstations. Similarly, QLogic and Emulex, which make chips that perform input/output tasks for servers, both said they will adjust their drivers for Itanium. In contrast, MSC Software came out with its own version of Linux for Itanium 2 on Monday. The Department of Energy's (DOE) Pacific Northwest National Laboratory will incorporate HP Itanium 2 servers running MSC's Linux into a clustered supercomputer.
2003-04-24 - Companies cozy up to Windows release   Server manufacturers will stump for Microsoft on Thursday, touting new customer wins and integration services for companies considering a move to Windows Server 2003. During a San Francisco gala, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is slated to officially launch Windows Server 2003. Dell Computer, Hewlett-Packard and Unisys are among the server makers expected to share the stage with Ballmer. Unisys is one of a few manufacturers using the release of the operating system to launch new servers. Most other manufacturers are announcing the availability of the software on existing machines. Dell and HP also will tout new customers and services offers aimed specially at enterprise customers, while IBM plans to stick with its broad range of existing services. Web hoster Digex plans to get into the services foray, announcing broad Windows Server 2003 support at its Laurel, Md.-based hosting facility. Digex also plans to extend hosting and services support for other upcoming Microsoft software, including Commerce Server and Exchange Server. Chipmaker Intel will tout the importance of running 64-bit Windows Server 2003 versions on systems running Itanium 2 processors. All the companies are expected to position their products and services around new branding. Last week, Microsoft rebranded its line of server software Windows Server System. The move is similar to the company's rechristening its line of desktop productivity software Office System. Microsoft is hoping to put less emphasis on individual products and more on the concept of a "platform" upon which companies can build technologies suitable for their line of business. Windows Server 2003 anchors the branding, which also encompasses Application Center, BizTalk Server, Commerce Server, Content Management Server, Exchange Server, Host Integration Server, Internet Security and Acceleration Server, Operations Manager, Project Server, Real-Time Communications Server, SharePoint Portal Server, SQL Server and Systems Management Server. In another sign of Microsoft's increasing its ties between desktop and server software, Project Server and SharePoint Portal Server belong to both Office Sstem and Windows Server System. Some customers appear to support this integration. Marshall Gibbs, chief information officer of Information Resources, described the SharePoint rebranding as an "encouraging" change in Microsoft's thinking about the needs of large enterprise customers. "Moving the SharePoint Server to the Office team is one example of that," he said. "Microsoft is exploring an interesting strategy around centering Office on the desktop as the centerpiece for business intelligence-enabled team collaboration. The focus is on increasingly powerful tools in Office that are designed to drive business workers' ability to manipulate information and share it broadly together with a portal enterprise strategy. Server wares Dell on Thursday plans to reveal that it already has launched 9,000 PowerEdge servers worldwide running Windows Server 2003. The customers involved include the Nasdaq Stock Market and Kentucky's Department of Education. The Round Rock, Texas-based company also will talk about Dell Canada's piloting of Windows Server 2003 in an operation that responds to about 18,000 customer inquiries a day. "In our labs, a Dell PowerEdge server running Windows Server 2003 performed approximately 250 percent faster than an equally configured server running Windows NT," Pete Morowski, Dell's vice president of software, said in a statement. The PC maker will offer Windows Server 2003 across its entire PowerEdge line, emphasizing cost benefits, particularly for customers moving from Windows NT 4 Server. Microsoft estimates that about 35 percent of Windows Server customers use 7-year-old NT 4. Dell also is set to reveal plans to offer Itanium 2 servers later this year. Services-focused IBM doesn't plan to go beyond the services already bundled with its servers. But it will release new benchmarks for eight- and 16-processor x440 servers running the Datacenter version of Windows Server 2003. Like Dell, IBM plans to make Windows Server 2003 available across its line of Intel-based servers. Rather than a broad range of services, Gateway will tout new manageability features. From Thursday, the Poway, Calif.-based company, which is focused on small businesses, will offer a new version of Gateway Server Manager. The Web-based product is intended to help technology managers diagnose problems, reboot computers or manage updates. Earlier this month, Gateway launched two new rack-mount servers. The computer maker plans to offer Windows Server 2003 on these new models and its entire line of servers. Unisys plans to use the Windows Server 2003 event to launch a new multiarchitecture server. The ES7000/560, which supports up to 106 Intel processors, can be configured with a single 32-processor Xeon partition and two 16-processor Itanium 2 partitions. Businesses also can add as many as 42 blade servers. Customers do not necessarily need buy new hardware to running Windows Server 2003. Most versions of the software can be purchased as upgrades for existing computers. Windows Server 2003 will be available in four basic versions, with one of those being new. Microsoft also offers two 64-bit versions for Itanium 2 systems. Pricing for the new versions also reflects changes in how Microsoft licenses the software. Besides the server software, buyers must also purchase client access licenses, or CALs. Previously, Microsoft offered CALs on a per-seat basis. But under the new model, the CAL can either be purchased per computer or user. Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition will sell for $999 with five CALs or $1,199 for 10 CALs. The Enterprise Edition will sell for $3,999 with 25 CALs. Microsoft would not provide pricing for the Datacenter Edition, as that version of Windows Server 2003 must be purchased with a new computer. Microsoft is introducing a new server product, Web Edition, which will sell for $399. Additional CALs will be available for $199 in packs of five, or $799 for 20. Windows Server 2003 Terminal Server CALs will cost $749 for five and $2,669 for 20. Microsoft also requires what is called an external connector for users connecting from outside the network. The cost is $1,999 for Windows Server 2003 and $7,999 for the Terminal Server version.
2001-06-28 - Commentary Strong vendor strong challenges By Martin Reynolds, Gartner Analyst Intel has worked hard to expand its business in areas such as servers, networking and wireless, but the desktop remains the company's most crucial battlefield. Intel always has a spread of new products visible through the medium term as it enhances and upgrades its processors. The introduction of Itanium is a key initiative, and Tualatin is important, too. But Intel's current challenge is moving the Pentium 4 into the IT mainstream as the Pentium III processor reaches the end of its planned life cycle on the desktop. Gartner sees this challenge as one of convincing IT managers that the Pentium 4 platform can deliver long-term buying stability without the marketing challenges of the current Rambus designs. Gartner believes that Intel's next-generation chipset, if properly positioned and managed, can deliver on this requirement and looks forward to Intel's exposition of its road map. On the broader front, Intel faces its toughest competition ever from Advanced Micro Devices and is caught in the jaws of a slowing market, where lower prices are required to drive growth. The bottom line is that Intel faces some of its toughest challenges since the dog days of the 286 processor, and it needs to marshal all of its resources to grow its business. See news story: Intel makes strides with Tualatin chips One of its largest initiatives is its Macroprocessing campaign--the application of low-cost, high-performance technology to computing on a grand scale. Intel believes that Macroprocessing can open up a whole new realm of information technology that would allow managers to understand their businesses in more detail and in a more timely fashion than ever before. Gartner believes that investment in real-time business management will be a key strategic initiative for enterprises, and Intel's intent is to make Macroprocessing a foundation technology in pursuit of this goal.

2000-07-12 - Commentary Several factors will limit demand for 64-bit Windows 2000   By Neil MacDonald, Gartner Analyst Most businesses will greet the latest beta of Microsoft's 64-bit version of Windows 2000--and indications that the product is nearly complete--with little interest. Several factors will limit enterprise demand for this operating system (OS). First, businesses running See news story: Microsoft ready to send 64-bit Windows 2000 to developers applications that require high scalability have already turned to Unix operating systems, especially Solaris. Most of these already have 64-bit versions that are shipping today with applications to run on them. Second, widespread availability of systems based on Intel's IA-64 Itanium chip will take time to appear and longer to become cost-competitive. Although Microsoft may soon be able to ship its 64-bit OS, systems based on IA-64 will not become widely available until late in 2000. Third, since Microsoft's OS and IA-64 systems are not yet ready, application developers have yet to see significant demand for 64-bit versions of their products. The lack of compelling applications will slow adoption of 64-bit Windows. Fourth, systems based on the first generation of Intel's Itanium chip will have only a short useful life span and are not upgradeable. Gartner expects Intel to release its second-generation Itanium chip (code-named McKinley) in the first quarter of 2002. Businesses should understand that Microsoft's primary motivation for pushing its 64-bit OS is marketing--to have a story to tell when comparisons are made to high-end 64-bit Unix systems. But given the immaturity of the hardware, OS and applications, most businesses are unlikely to consider it worthwhile to implement the first Win64 systems other than for evaluating, testing and development. Use of Win64 in production environments will be scant in 2001 and 2002. In general, the Windows-on-IA-64 market will be a slowly growing niche market. Recognizing this, many software vendors, including Microsoft, will use the Itanium launch for marketing, for great demonstrations of applications that can use unique 64-bit features, and as a development and testing platform to prepare the market. Gartner does not believe that Win64 will find a significant market presence until 2003. Entire contents, Copyright 2000 Gartner Group, Inc. All rights reserved.

2001-06-15 - Commentary Oracle faces challenges with 9i Despite adding ambitious capabilities to 9i, Oracle still faces challenges with its first new version of its database software in two years. 9i provides new functions in areas such as OLTP and decision support and brings Oracle even with DB2 and SQL Server in OLAP performance. However, adding capabilities such as cube building in the DBMS and Real Application Clusters (RAC) are keys to this new release--and the most significant technical challenge. If this extension of Oracle Parallel See news story: Oracle takes on foes with new price plan Server works, it will be a significant advancement, providing the capability to expand a database with new logical nodes in a shared environment on any platform that Oracle supports. Logical clustering is difficult in an OLTP environment, and Oracle is the only vendor to even attempt it on a platform it does not totally control. However, that "if" is significant, given the short beta period Oracle gave 9i to meet Larry Ellison's promise to deliver the new database version in the first half of this year. We recommend that users wait 10 to 12 months before moving production databases to 9i, just as we would for any major DBMS migration. But Oracle should get some credit for attempting this feat. In effect, it is demonstrating its leadership of the database industry just by making the attempt. However, we do not expect RAC to work immediately without a hiccup in production systems. We expect that Oracle will need to bring out intermediate upgrades, and that it may not work outside specialized applications on any platform until clustered file systems are available for the four major platforms. This should be available from Veritas around the same time as the next scheduled major upgrade of 9i, which is due in March 2002. A key question is when Microsoft will come out with a cluster file system. Oracle wants to include cluster file system functionality in RAC so that it will work on any platform, but we believe it will take a significant amount of time to achieve that. Combining this with the introduction of Intel's new 64-bit Itanium processor family creates the possibility of commodity Unix systems. Hewlett-Packard and IBM have promised to port HP-UX and AIX to Itanium. But, significantly, Sun has no plans to move the SPARC environment. If Oracle does succeed with RAC, it will be a major breakthrough in database capabilities. Although Oracle talks about it mainly as an advance for OLTP, we see its most valuable use in high-availability situations requiring a master/slave environment. We also expect early adoption for analytical applications, which currently are some of few applications that use two nodes under Oracle Parallel Server. But it does not deliver the performance that IBM's and NCR's shared-nothing architectures deliver. We believe Oracle has a good chance of making RAC work. From an architectural standpoint, it looks sound, and when it does work it will be a huge leap. For example, users that currently have a high-availability application on an eight-way system typically have a second eight-way system standing by in slave mode. If these users want to move to a 16-way system, with RAC they will no longer need a second 16-way just to stand by in slave mode. Users should not plan to move production databases to 9i for at least six to eight months, giving Oracle a chance to iron out the inevitable wrinkles associated with a release this significant. Risk-weary users should wait until the second major version appears in March 2002. Those with advanced needs demanding leading-edge technology (such as high-availability master/slave databases) should use the intervening period for testing. In general, however, we expect 9i to have significant issues. Sixty days is too short for a general beta test of major enterprise software, particularly because it would take the testers several weeks just to get their hands on it and get around to installing it. Users should regard the next 10 months as the real 9i beta test. META Group analysts Mark Shainman, Charles Garry, Val Sribar, Dale Kutnick, and David Cearley contributed to this article.

2002-02-04 - Commentary McKinley's big impression   By Martin Reynolds, Gartner Analyst McKinley, the second-generation processor in Intel's Itanium processor family, offers important improvements over the first generation in raw processor power and adoption by original equipment manufacturers. From a large-system perspective, the McKinley processor will have embedded mainframe-class reliability features that are required for applications in which data integrity and reliability cannot be compromised. Moreover, McKinley's system bandwidth is roughly triple that of the first-generation Itanium processor (Merced). That bandwidth is critical for server applications and yields substantial performance advantages in a server environment. To support this higher-bandwidth bus, Intel has delivered an enhanced 3MB level three on-chip cache and performed a host of fine-tuning to the architecture that will increase performance 1.5 to 2 times over Itanium running current code. See news story: Intel's McKinley is one big chip In addition, McKinley will enable a host of fine-tuning to the architecture, which will increase performance across the board and prepare for the next round of processor and clock-speed enhancements. Those enhancements will make the McKinley chip relatively large. However, it will still be economically feasible to manufacture--even though it appears to be at the size limits of high-volume technology. Surprisingly, the silicon size will add only a few tens of dollars to the raw manufacturing cost because most of the cost of such a processor is in design, validation, packaging, test and assembly. One manufacturing issue with such a large die is that it occupies capacity that would otherwise go to higher-volume products. However, Intel has plenty of capacity, and McKinley volumes will be relatively small, so that is not a critical issue for Intel. The Itanium update after McKinley is Madison, a 0.13-micron process device that will deliver higher clock frequencies and a smaller die size. For now, however, the economics of McKinley are just fine on the 0.18-micron lines. (For a related commentary on servers powered by McKinley processors, see gartner.com.)

2002-05-29 - Commentary Itanium advances    By Martin Reynolds, Gartner Analyst Itanium's raw performance casts no shadow over Intel's other processors. This shortcoming has placed the server chip in a weak position when coupled with the need for a completely new object code. See news story: Intel sees double with Itanium 2 However, Itanium was designed to deal with three critical issues: long-term memory performance, integrity and server performance. These factors must all be balanced carefully for enterprise applications. The result is a bit different from what a desktop speed-demon chip delivers. Regarding the issue of the memory performance, processors run at speeds in the gigahertz range, while memory subsystems still have access speeds of about 20MHz. That performance gap will continue to widen because processor manufacturers make their money on high clock-speed specifications and memory makers focus on price-per-megabyte specifications. One solution is a larger cache. Itanium 2 has a 3MB cache on the die itself, and Intel's other processors are looking more and more like fast memories with a processor embedded on the die. Another solution is a new architecture. Itanium's highly parallel architecture will continue to increase in performance as its compiler advances. Moreover, Itanium is designed for a different environment. It incorporates features that are designed to guarantee the integrity of data--features that are missing from Intel's other processors. Itanium 2 also offers a dramatically faster system bus than the Pentium 4, running at 6.4 GB per second compared to 4.2 GB per second, and the ability to connect multiple processors in parallel without crippling the system bus. In the long run, some of the benefits from the research and development for the Itanium architecture will make their way into the Pentium line. At the same time, the astonishing manufacturing advances behind the Pentium 4--which were not foreseen when Itanium was planned--will make their way into Itanium, such as faster clock speeds and greater resources. Gartner expects that Itanium will continue to close the gap on Pentium performance, while offering the security, reliability and integrity that enterprise-class servers require. Enterprises should carefully evaluate Itanium against their requirements. For some applications, it may be the most cost-effective alternative. And as Itanium advances in its abilities, it will sweep more applications into its fold. It is important to determine those applications for which Itanium is effective, and avoid those for which it is not. (For a related commentary on the Itanium processor family, see gartner.com.)

2001-06-26 - Commentary Good news for Windows shops Compaq Computer has struggled to bring appropriate focus to its diverse businesses ever since it bought Digital Equipment and Tandem. If its announcement to place more emphasis on See news story: Compaq narrows server-chip competition software and services indicates that senior management is finally making the hard decisions it has so far avoided--particularly about what to spin off and what to keep--then this is a good sign for Compaq. If not, the company will continue to drift. A stronger focus on services by Compaq could benefit end users with large Windows environments and global support needs. Compaq is one of the world's largest and best Microsoft Exchange design and installation shops, with impressive references worldwide. Exactly what Compaq intends by refocusing on services and software is still unclear. However, we do not expect the company to start buying business applications--for instance, a CRM (customer relationship management) software vendor--and enter the application package market. Rather, we think it will look at middleware, storage management, systems management, asset management and messaging capabilities to augment its services and systems management offerings. We also expect Compaq to continue to aggressively partner with business application vendors, such as Siebel Systems. To support these application projects and differentiate its offerings, Compaq is likely to prepackage bundles of services, integration software, systems management capabilities and hardware around these business applications. The hazards of the game However, Compaq faces several dangers with this shift in emphasis. First, when all is said and done, Compaq will be an Intel-based hardware vendor, supporting primarily Windows along with Tru64, which we expect it to port to and make available on both Alpha and Intel's 64-bit chips--Itanium in the near term, McKinley in the longer term. With this reality in mind, Compaq must succeed in the Intel-based hardware market. This means that it must be able to position itself against both the high-end players such as IBM and more cost-conscious competitors such as Dell Computer. Both IBM and Dell have made significant cost-cutting inroads on their Intel-based systems, which Compaq must beat--or at least match. Second, Compaq must avoid competing with its larger resellers, many of which provide their own services to customers as part of their packages. When defining services, Compaq must consider partnerships in providing services and hardware with the application vendor, as it will struggle to appear platform-neutral and merely to be pushing hardware. Desktop services have been a struggle for the company in non-Compaq shops. Third, Compaq must avoid fragmentation. If the company ends up dividing into several stovepipe organizations, each focused on a vertical market, this will increase the fragmentation that already prevents it from focusing effectively on any one strategy. Overall, Compaq should not count on services to specific verticals to replace the income from server and desktop sales. Instead, it must focus on ways to compete more strongly in those markets. Vertical horizon In the past two decades, several hardware companies that have run into trouble in the market have retreated and stated that they would refocus on specific vertical industries and on providing services. IBM succeeded at this strategy, while other companies--including Digital and Unisys--have found it a recipe for creating a smaller company. Compaq must be careful that it does not fall into this trap. For Intel, the purchase of Compaq's Alpha processor operation makes sense. Although the Alpha market itself is fading, Intel will gain additional patents as well as some strong engineering talent. We recommend that Alpha users evaluate Itanium in its first release to set up a migration strategy before the transition from EV6 to EV7. They should then consider a route to Itanium McKinley-based servers from Alpha by the end of 2002 and complete the transition by the end of 2003. Organizations with large Windows installations should watch Compaq's services offerings carefully. To the extent that Compaq is serious about competing more effectively with IBM and other major services providers, its natural market is in integrating large NT-based systems, where it is one of the market leaders. Compaq has built several of the largest Exchange systems worldwide. To expand its presence in the services arena, Compaq may be willing to offer those services at a cut-rate price to gain entries into companies and markets where it does not now have a strong presence.

2002-05-31 - Commentary Good but not enough By George Weiss and Andrew Butler, Gartner Analysts The Linux community urgently needs a common platform, but the UnitedLinux initiative faces hurdles. See news story: Unified Linux effort won't faze Red Hat The four companies from three continents that have formed UnitedLinux aim to brand it as a common Linux server platform. Their initial group of 10 partners includes some of the biggest names in the Linux movement, but not the biggest name in Linux distributions--Red Hat. Red Hat has formed its own alliance for its Advanced Server (announced in March 2002) and says it has the commitment of 80 independent software vendors (ISVs), including Oracle, which has not publicly endorsed UnitedLinux. The four vendors will commit resources to releasing a standard platform, including booting, installation, development, runtime, updates and support. One paid employee at UnitedLinux will direct the alliance branding process. Applications tested against the platform's standard, which will include the Linux Standards Base (LSB) effort, will be certified as meeting the UnitedLinux specifications. Both ISVs and hardware vendors should welcome the potential for UnitedLinux to reduce the costs and complexities of supporting Linux. The partners have stated that UnitedLinux will focus on Intel's IA32 (and emerging Itanium 64-bit) processors and will also support IBM's eServer range. The concept of UnitedLinux is sound in principle and urgently needed. But this venture could splinter in many ways: Unless UnitedLinux includes, or provides close convergence with, Red Hat's distribution, it will not mean "one Linux." While not absolutely essential for the group's success, Red Hat's large North American market share presents added difficulty for ISVs, especially as enhancements to enterprise operating system spur more possibilities of divergence. A key organizational unit for branding and certification that has only one paid, full-time employee will not likely have the bandwidth to assure complete integrity and backward compatibility for thousands of applications. UnitedLinux must designate registered third parties. It is not clear how the Open Source Development Lab, LSB and many other Linux organizations and efforts (for instance, in high availability and file systems) will coordinate their work and agree on inclusions and upgrades. Also doubtful is whether consensus will be feasible if outsiders such as Red Hat, Oracle, Veritas Software and MandrakeSoft want to join. The UnitedLinux effort takes a step forward in consolidating multiple versions of Linux. But the execution is in the details, and it may still fall short of what is required.

2001-07-30 - Commentary Going mobile for real   By Mark Margevicius, Gartner Analyst Until now, notebook microprocessors have been desktop derivatives. Pentium III-M and 830 change all that. See news story: Intel ups ante in notebook race Intel's latest mobile efforts includes five new Pentium III-M ("M" standing for "mobile") microprocessors. Unlike previously announced processors, the Pentium III-M targets mobile systems specifically. The 830 chipset offers a single chipset across all mobile PC platforms. Based on the new Tualatin 0.13-micron process, the Pentium III-M closes the gap on desktop performance by offering higher speeds (866MHz, 933MHz, 1GHz, 1.06GHz and 1.13GHz), more Level 2 cache (512KB, up from 256KB) and lower power needs. Intel eventually plans to shift all processor manufacturing (mobile, desktop and server) to the 0.13-micron process. That process enables significantly higher manufacturing yields without significantly raising costs, which ultimately means better technology offered at or below today's prices. The Pentium III-M also offers improved power management with "Enhanced SpeedStep," which can throttle power-based application and system requirements. Equally important is the introduction of the 830 chipset, which has several key aspects: integrated graphics, integrated connectivity and platform versatility. The onboard, integrated graphics enable computer makers to continue to shrink platforms and optimize with standardized video. Integrated connectivity allows mobile computer makers to offer integrated 802.11, Bluetooth and Ethernet connectivity without consuming precious system-board or PCMCIA real estate. Most significant about 830 is its applicability in all notebook sizes. Up to now, computer makers used different chipsets for different notebook segments (815 for desktop replacement, 440BX for mainstream and 440MX for ultraportable), forcing companies to create unique system images for each segment. The 830 enables developers to create a single image for all three platform segments. This development, then, will simplify IT departments' image creation and management tasks. Gartner views the Pentium III-M and 830 as Intel's recognition of the importance and uniqueness of the mobile segment (much as Itanium signaled a similar understanding of the server market). Traditionally, Intel has viewed mobile processors as an offshoot of the desktop; however, the portable systems have different key attributes--such as mobility, power and connectivity--than do the desktops. For the most part, mobile computing requirements marginally match those of the desktop, where they primarily focus on compatibility between applications and operating systems. Other attributes, such as wireless connectivity, are critical to mobile while having little value on the desktop. (For a related commentary on Intel's mobile processors, see Gartner.com.)

2001-06-12 - Commentary Digesting the server glut   Recent reports of slowing server sales are actually a trailing indicator for the technology market. The leading indicator was the reduction in IT budgets and general delay in the release of new projects that has characterized user planning and spending for the last two quarters. We expect the server market slump to continue through the end of 2001 as the market digests the infrastructure growth of 1999-2000 and projects continue to be delayed. However, we predict that a combination of factors, including the maturing of new server technologies such as Intel's Itanium, new capacity demand and an uptick in spending on new projects in early 2001 will lead to renewed growth in the server market by mid-2002. Several market forces have contributed to slowing server sales. First, many of the dot-coms that purchased technology at a frantic pace through the summer of 2000 and helped drive Sun Microsystems' sales in particular have faded from the picture. Many of these companies are no longer in business, and their infrastructure--sometimes still in the box--flooded the secondary market in early 2001. Surviving companies are being much more cautious about spending. The telco industry, another major source of networking and server purchases, has also been hit hard by the economic slowdown. Finally, Web hosting, ISP and application hosting companies have also slowed or stopped spending as demand for their services wanes and they go through their own shakeout. Now, instead of investing tens of millions of dollars in building new data centers, companies that need additional capacity (or simply have cash available) can buy significant infrastructure for pennies on the dollar, as witnessed by the recent Digital Island acquisition. Compounding the slowdown in new projects and the glut of product on the market is the fact that many organizations overbought in 2000 and now have 30 percent to 40 percent of their server capacity available for expansion. These companies rightly view new server purchases as discretionary enhancements that can be delayed. We expect these companies will not be ready to resume expansion of their systems until usage grows into the 80 percent range or significant new applications are deployed. The third and most critical driver to the current infrastructure slowdown--which is hitting networking, client and server purchases alike--is the budget lockdown and project deferral that many companies put in place during the first half of 2001. Starting early this year, most user companies put all new IT projects on hold. Our research shows that most new projects are likely to remain on hold through the end of 2001. As a result, IT departments have drastically cut purchases of new servers. We expect the excess capacity and secondary market glut to have been "digested" and the demand for nondiscretionary infrastructure enhancements to rise by the end of 2001. More importantly, we expect the demand for infrastructure to support new projects will also begin to surge again. How the turnaround will begin Although many projects have been put on hold, key CRM (customer relationship management), supply chain and even e-business projects have not often been totally eliminated. Instead, IT and business users are being forced to more clearly evaluate the cost/benefit trade-off and focus attention on projects that have the highest potential for near-term payback and/or significant competitive advantage in the market. In fact, we expect traditional brick-and-mortar companies to lead the charge (or at least the slow jog) back to e-business. However, rather than blindly allocate funds to "anything e," these investments will be highly targeted. We expect the first indications of a market turnaround will be the release of targeted projects currently on hold--including selected Windows 2000 migrations and targeted optimizing of CRM and commerce chain management arrangements by the end of 2001 or early 2002. The Web market will take longer to recover because of the cynicism now directed at e-business and the confusion over the best strategies to use on the Web. See news story: PC sales flu infects servers In the near term, the slowdown will have interesting effects on the adoption of new technologies. As vendors attempt to gain competitive advantage in a stagnant or shrinking market, we expect them to focus more attention on higher-margin, leading-edge systems in an attempt to gain market differentiation. However, many users may choose to stay with older technology--buying lower on the price curve to save money. This will likely force Intel, IBM and Compaq Computer to reduce the price of newer technologies (such as Itanium-based systems) more quickly than usual to drive demand. When the recovery does occur, we expect IBM, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and, to a lesser extent Dell Computer--the Itanium vendor group--to be best positioned for recovery. Just as new project investment begins to flow a bit more freely, Itanium will begin to mature, providing a more unified "Wintelnix" platform. At least theoretically, users will have the ability to focus on a common hardware platform to run either Windows or one of a variety of Unix flavors. Therefore, Wintelnix may further isolate Sun's Solaris/SPARC platform. This, and the fact that Sun benefited heavily from the dot-com and telco boom markets that will be slow to recover, means that Sun will likely be slower to rebound. For users, this situation could hardly be more ideal. The current squeeze in server demand will force server vendors to offer excellent deals, but it will not be enough to drive anyone out of business. It will be a strong buyer's market this year and likely through the first quarter of 2002. However, many organizations are facing a soft business climate in their own industries, and spending must be done carefully. Users should review the projects they have on hold and pick the ones with the clearest and most immediate business advantage and cost justification. They should also plan carefully for exactly how they can implement these selected projects to gain competitive advantage in the marketplace. By focusing "rifle shot" doses of spending in these areas, some companies will be able to turn a tough economy into an opportunity and be best positioned to gain share when the economy eventually turns around. Leading-edge companies will start implementing projects earlier to get ahead of their competition and to exploit the present marketplace by getting the best deals on equipment.

2001-01-03 - Commentary AMD's got a server Sledgehammer By John Enck, Gartner Analyst Advanced Micro Devices has struggled to find a way to compete with Intel in the server market. The issues preventing the chipmaker's See news story: Transmeta to help AMD push into servers success thus far have been as much business-related as technical. For example: AMD does not produce motherboards that support more than two processors, while Intel's motherboards support up to eight. Intel's relationships with its OEM partners such as Compaq Computer, Dell Computer, IBM and Hewlett-Packard are very strong in the server segment of the market. Enterprise standards for server reliability, manageability and performance are high, but AMD has no track record in this area. AMD hopes that its new 64-bit product, code-named Sledgehammer, will provide the needed weight to break into the tough but lucrative server market. Intel's 64-bit processor product, code-named Itanium, requires that operating systems and applications be explicitly rewritten for 64-bit operations for optimal performance. AMD's "code-morphing" approach, on the other hand, should provide performance boosts to existing 32-bit software applications as well as allow software to be rewritten to take full advantage of the 64-bit extensions. As for AMD's establishing a partnership with Transmeta, that partnership would enable AMD to bring the technology to market faster. However, Transmeta does not have the technology or business channels to address the issues that have thus far limited AMD's success in the server market. As is the case with AMD, the relationships between Transmeta and the industry standard manufacturers mentioned above are primarily on the laptop and desktop side of the business. Gartner views the combination of AMD and Transmeta as providing no additional leverage for AMD to crack the server market.

2001-04-20 - Commentary AMD ''reasonably uncrushable'' vs Intel This just in: Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD) has proclaimed itself "reasonably uncrushable" when it comes to battling its larger nemesis Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC). We'd take it a step farther and say AMD has graduated from being a chimp to a gorilla. Now there are two 800-pound gorillas in the chip market. Luckily for us, the gorilla warfare is entertaining. AMD checked in with its latest quarterly results Wednesday and threw in a stock split for good measure. The company reported second quarter net income of $207.1 million, or $1.21 per share. First Call's survey of 18 analysts predicted an AMD profit of $1.14 per share for the quarter ended July 2. Sales were up 7 percent sequentially to $1.17 billion. Exactly a year ago, AMD was losing tons of cash. The results, coupled with strong demand that only "an act of God" could derail, had AMD officials giddy. And why not? AMD has been running circles around Intel, which has had numerous problems and took a $200 million charge to replace defective motherboards in its second quarter. In the chip race, AMD is giving Intel a great run with strong products. In addition, AMD's quarter was refreshing because it was clean and easy to understand. Translation: No major investment gains to puff up results. Intel's quarter was messy to say the least. The company had a $2.1 billion investment gain in its second quarter. Back that gain out and Intel doesn't look so hot. In fact, operating earnings were flat. Of course, Intel gets a free pass on Wall Street. Of 33 analysts only three are cautious on the stock. No matter how many glitches, odd financial items or body blows Intel takes from AMD, analysts are usually cheery despite the challenges. "We believe that Intel will likely outperform in the second half," said Scott Randall, an analyst at Wit SoundView, who reiterated a "strong buy" rating Wednesday. But even the biggest cheerleaders have a few concerns. Ashok Kumar, of USB Piper Jaffray, said Intel "left some money on the table" by underestimating demand in recent quarters. Meanwhile, AMD keeps making a lot of noise. On a conference call with analysts, Hector J. Ruiz, president and chief operating officer for AMD, struggled to be negative. "I have to think hard to say something negative," he said. The processor market also looks robust, executives said. Shipments of 1GHz Athlon chips quintupled during the quarter, said Ruiz. "We were able to meet our commitments to all our customers in this high-end segment," Ruiz said, contrasting Athlon's availability with the shortage of Intel's 1GHz Pentium III chips. As for the flash memory market, there's no slowdown in sight. AMD said it is already sold out through the year. Some analysts have said flash memory, which powers wireless devices, was headed for a slowdown. On its core Athlon and Duron processors, AMD was also bullish. The company said shipments will increase to 3.6 million units in the third quarter and to 7.2 million units in the fourth quarter. The growth should provide higher average selling prices. The chip market is fragile and has a history of boom and bust cycles, but for now AMD is booming. Big Blue sees blue skies in second halfAfter three quarters devoid of revenue growth, investors were hoping for any kind of optimism coming from IBM's (NYSE: IBM) second quarter conference call. Big Blue delivered. As far as the second quarter results go, IBM had a ho-hum quarter. The company topped estimates with earnings of $1.06 a share, but sales fell 1 percent year-over-year to $21.7 billion. The outlook, however, was the real focus. The company remains comfortable with analysts' full year earnings estimates, CFO John Joyce said, during a conference call with analysts. First Call currently predicts a profit of $4.36 per share for 2000. Joyce also said he "felt good about our momentum." Joyce said mainframe shipments were perking up (1 percent growth in the second quarter after previous declines), and added the second half looked strong. Joyce even went out on a limb and said the company could hit double-digit revenue growth in the second half. Analysts estimate that IBM will post mid-single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth in the second half. IBM even said its PC division may post a profit by the end of the year. Now that's optimistic.

2001-09-19 - Commentary A well-timed server debut   By Andrew Butler, Gartner Analyst The new rp8400 from Hewlett-Packard, code-named Keystone, looks to be an impressive machine that carries on and improves upon HP's solid tradition of midrange Unix servers. See news story: HP boosts Unix server line It offers a 16-way, rack-optimized platform with multidomain capability at a very competitive price, further moving the "sweet spot" for midrange servers away from eight-way boxes. HP's introduction of the rp8400 at this time will, however, fuel speculation about the future of the vendor's midrange N-Class server, the eight-way rp7400, which has been a mainstay of HP's server line. The N-Class was marketed as eventually being capable of a board-level Itanium upgrade. But the availability of Itanium processors was slower than expected, making those upgrades for the N-Class unlikely before the McKinley launch date next year. At that point, the N-Class line would have been four years old. This forced HP into a corner. Should the company back down on its marketing promises by not offering an Itanium upgrade for the N-Class--which is really the sensible thing to do--or shoehorn a new processor into a near-obsolete platform? HP recently decided to do the former and canceled the planned Itanium upgrade for the N-Class. Now the shiny new rp8400, with attractive pricing and features, is available to help cushion the blow. As HP was in the process of shifting its whole product line to Itanium, the N-Class wasn't really equipped to make the trip. Gartner believes HP will be happy to see the rp8400 cannibalize market share from the N-Class. At the other end of the server spectrum, the new product may cannibalize market share from HP's high-end Superdome server as well. The rp8400 will help convince customers that HP can still build an excellent midrange Unix server, but the machine cannot by itself reverse the recent decline in HP's Unix fortunes. HP is now in the "quiet" period of its proposed merger with Compaq Computer and will continue to compete with Compaq, in addition to usual rivals Sun Microsystems and IBM, for the next six months or more. Until the full implications of the merger of the HP and Compaq server lines become clear, many customers will likely remain cautious and probably confine themselves to tactical purchases. Gartner believes that the rp8400 is likely to survive the merger. Even so, during a period of such uncertainty HP's chief competitors will likely be aggressive in sowing the seeds of fear, uncertainty and doubt. At the moment there's little HP can do about that. But the rp8400 fills a void in the HP product line and should set the new benchmark for 16-way Unix serving. Companies should consider this platform where affordable scaling beyond eight-way is required.

2001-05-11 - Commentary A slow assault on Unix  Intel's 64-bit Itanium chip, expected to be introduced at the end of May, is a major competitive threat to high-end RISC/Unix workstations and servers--but this threat will take some time to develop. Jumping to 64-bit processing is a major See news story: Itanium to arrive at last technical accomplishment for Intel. However, a processor is only part of a full computer system. Other component makers must redesign their peripherals to take advantage of 64-bit processing, and computer manufacturers must design full systems around Itanium, which will require time. This process may be delayed by the promise of a second-generation Itanium chip (McKinley), which is scheduled to be released in about 11 months. We expect some hardware vendors--such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer, and Dell Computer--to introduce initial Itanium systems early to win bragging rights, but the truly commercial systems will be based on McKinley and will be introduced in 2002. The initial systems--particularly 16-way servers from IBM and HP--will expose Unisys's high-end "Wintel" servers as purely tactical offerings. Windows has been 64-bit-enabled for some time and should run on Itanium systems out of the box. However, software vendors must retune their applications for 64-bit processing before they can deliver a real step forward in performance. This is particularly important for the CAD systems that engineers run on high-end Unix workstations. The same need for application retuning has occurred in past shifts to a new processing architecture, such as the move from 16-bit to 32-bit processing. The largest initial market for Itanium servers probably will be small and midsize database servers, because the leading Unix-based database systems are already optimized for 64-bit processing on Unix platforms. We expect the initial Itanium servers to be too expensive to compete for the lower and middle tiers of the three-tier Web server architecture, although they may find a place in security servers. Sixteen-way Itanium servers also may find an early home in the back-end third tier of Web architectures, where their large address space will enable effective management of large amounts of storage and memory and where the software is already optimized for 64-bit computing. Two and three years down the road By 2003, we expect 64-bit versions of key applications to start appearing on the market, and by 2004 Itanium will be competing head to head with Unix/RISC, moving Wintel into the high-end server market for the first time. This will definitely provide major competition for Unix vendors, although exactly how much will depend on price and performance. In the long term, we expect 64-way McKinley servers to deliver huge amounts of performance. But even a 16-way Itanium server this year is not a small platform for the back end. For the rest of 2001 at least, most consumers should generally adopt a "look but don't touch" policy when it comes to Itanium-based servers. The exceptions will occur when a company has applications that started small on Windows NT and have grown rapidly, such as Oracle databases running on NT as the back end of a multitier Web architecture, an arrangement that would benefit from the raw power of the Itanium processor. Consumers should view the pre-McKinley Itanium-based servers mainly as compatibility test beds for the performance of key software and the effect of Itanium servers on their computing environments. They should wait until McKinley to do performance testing--because the second-generation chip will increase performance dramatically--and to bring Itanium into production environments. However, consumers should be aware that any Wintel servers and high-end workstations they buy during the next few months may have a shorter-than-normal life before being replaced with Itanium-based hardware. Also, in a few months as Itanium reaches the marketplace, Intel will reduce the price of its Pentium 4, decreasing the cost and therefore the residual value of units based on that processor. Meta Group analysts Jack Gold, Dale Kutnick, David Cearley, Mark Shainman, Philip Dawson, Steve Kleynhans, Val Sribar and William Zachmann contributed to this report.Visit Metagroup.com for more analysis of key IT and e-business issues.Entire contents, Copyright 2001 Meta Group, Inc.

2000-02-02 - Coalition says Linux ready for Intel's upcoming chips  NEW YORK--A Linux coalition called the Trillian project has publicly released a version of the operating system that works on Intel's next-generation microprocessors. The software now is available to anyone, not just the select few from a handful of companies that currently have worked on the Trillian project, executives at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo said here today. The Trillian effort began two years ago with David Mosberger's work at HP, the company that developed the architecture used in the upcoming 64-bit Itanium chip. Now the effort has expanded to include IBM, SGI, VA Linux Systems, Intel, Red Hat, Caldera Systems, SuSE, TurboLinux, CERN and Cygnus Solutions, a company acquired by Red Hat. In addition, representatives from the four biggest sellers of Linux said they will ship versions of their software as soon as systems built with the Itanium chip ships--currently expected in the second half of the year. These companies joined Trillian in December and now have some of relatively scarce prototype Itanium-based computers. Linux has much to gain from Itanium and the future members of Intel's IA-64 family that could help carry Linux into higher-end servers. However, Linux is young in this high-end market, and Itanium is even younger, so it's not clear how quickly the new systems will take over from the current Linux stronghold on 32-bit Intel chips. Even though very few have access to the few hundred Itanium machines, ordinary people will be able to help in the Trillian effort soon. In two weeks at the Intel Developer's Forum, the programming tools to write software for the Itanium chips will be available, meaning that people will be able to see if their software translates to the IA-64 chip even if they don't have an Itanium computer. Linux, a clone of Unix and competitor to Windows, is different from those better-established operating systems because its original programming instructions are freely available and the software itself is developed by several companies as well as numerous individuals. This strategy is called open-source development. However, marrying open source development to the proprietary constraints of a still-unreleased chip design was awkward, said Ron Curry of Intel. "This is somewhat of a new environment for the Linux development to occur," Curry said. In some ways, "Linux is just catching up to the way other operating system developers have code for new processor products. It's a lot easier to go talk to (Sun) or Microsoft four years before the product and put a non-disclosure agreement in place." Awkward, perhaps, but the strategy has worked, said HP's Mosberger. "I think it is living proof that it is possible to have competing companies work together and produce open source in the way open source was meant to be developed," Mosberger said. The Itanium chip will enable Intel to sell chips for a category of more powerful, more expensive servers that currently are powered by chips from IBM, Compaq, Sun Microsystems and SGI. Linux companies soared on the news, lead by VA Linux and Red Hat. At 1 p.m. PST, the close of regular trading, VA Linux was up $29 to $136.88, a 26.88 percent gain. Red Hat was up $15.50 to $108, a 16.76 percent gain. Itanium will enable faster mathematical calculations than current chips, so many companies expect the Itanium to be popular with scientific and technical users. The European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland, one of the Trillian members, has been working on software modules that will make mathematical calculations run well on Itanium, and Hewlett-Packard has been helping to fund the effort, said Mike Balma, leader of HP's Open Source Solutions Operation. Newer chips from Intel also will boost math performance. The "Foster" chip, due later this year, will be cheaper than Itanium but more powerful than current Pentium chips. Markus Rex, development director of Linux seller SuSE, is one of the lucky few to have an Itanium machine. He described it in one word: "Loud." The prototype machine has lots of fans to keep it cool, and therefore is sufficiently noisy enough that he quickly moved it from his office to the server room. Microsoft also is working on a new version of Windows that will work on Itanium. That version is expected to be ready at the launch of Itanium systems. By the end of June, Intel expects to have thousands of IA-64 prototype machines out, Curry said.

2001-08-31 - Chipmakers angle for Linux support In a sign of how strategic Linux has become, AMD and Intel are angling to lure open-source programmers to their future chip designs. Linux--with a strong developer community and a flexibility that allows the Unix clone to run on numerous chips--has become an asset the chipmakers want on their sides as they prepare future chip designs. Linux has become a tool to secure quick support for a new chip. "Linux gets software into market more quickly than waiting for support from Microsoft," said Mercury Research analyst Dean McCarron. "Linux is a wonderful operating system for rapid deployment. The Microsoft operating systems ultimately get used in very large volume, but when (a chip) is first coming out, those operating systems aren't typically available." Linux has been running on 64-bit chips such as Compaq's Alpha, SGI's MIPS and Sun's UltraSparc for years, but Windows is a relative newcomer, with a first, limited 64-bit version arriving this week. And Microsoft, with conservative customers and huge support costs for new products, moves more deliberately than the comparatively freewheeling Linux community. Because the fast-paced Linux world is filled with developers and companies eager to make names for themselves, backing Linux also can help put pressure on Microsoft. "I think it is the Linux presence that will cause Microsoft to have to take Hammer seriously," Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood said of AMD's upcoming line of high-end processors. "You know that there will be a Linux implementation that supports Hammer. Assuming it provides attractive performance characteristics, and Microsoft wants to dominate the server world the way it dominates the desktop, it's going to have to address the Hammer issue, or it won't be able to complete its domination." The 64-bit question Intel and AMD are working on 64-bit chips--higher-end models that can handle vastly larger amounts of memory and transfer information in bigger chunks than 32-bit products such as Intel's Pentium or AMD's Athlon. Most 64-bit chips are used in servers, the high-powered networked computers where Linux is most common. Both Intel and AMD crave a bigger presence in the lucrative and prestigious server market. Without software support, new chips will fail, and each chip faces its own hurdles. Intel's new Itanium chips speak an entirely different language than the 32-bit chips, so software must be reworked to take advantage of the change. AMD's Hammer line is a 64-bit extension of the language used by the 32-bit chips and will run current software well, but taking advantage of 64-bit features will require software to be overhauled. In May, Intel introduced the first version of Itanium, code-named Merced, but analysts and computer makers have higher expectations for Merced's successor, McKinley. Hammer is scheduled to arrive in the first half of 2002, the same time as McKinley. German Linux seller SuSE, for one, believes both chips hold promise for its long-term plans, said Holger Dyroff, SuSE's director of sales and marketing. "We think that with both chips--AMD's Sledgehammer (the top model in the Hammer line) and Intel's Itanium--we can grow into the traditional Unix market" currently dominated by 64-bit chips from Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and IBM. Intel pioneered close involvement with Linux programmers more than a year before it introduced the first Itanium chip. Now AMD is following the same model with its Hammer chips, working in particular with SuSE and establishing a Web site for the effort. The newest version of Linux, 2.4.9, is available for Hammer. GCCing into the future To improve Linux support for Itanium, Intel last week announced it would sell key software, called compilers, which translate software written by humans into the instructions a chip can understand. Compilers are necessary for any chip, but the performance of software on the Itanium chip is particularly sensitive to the quality of compilers. The Intel compiler Meta Group says IT organizations should acquire experience with Linux as a potential long-term alternative to Microsoft Windows and Unix offerings. see commentary is fine for some, but most Linux developers use GCC, known more for its support of many languages and chips than for its optimization for any particular technology. And GCC for Itanium "has a ways to go," said David Mosberger, Hewlett-Packard senior research scientist and leader of the effort to bring Linux to Itanium. "A lot of people just use GCC. It's very important to help...developers get compilers up to speed," Mosberger said. Happily for Linux fans, it appears that such work is happening. Representatives from Intel, IBM, HP, Red Hat and SGI gathered at a summit meeting to work on improving GCC. AMD and Intel both had prominent booths at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo this week. Among those pitching the Hammer designs: AMD's Kevin McGrath and Conor Malone, in charge of wooing software developers to Hammer. The Linux compiler for Hammer is "pretty much done," Malone said, and will be included in the next update of GCC. "It's not unreasonable to think a Linux port will be out before any kind of Windows," Malone said. Focusing on Itanium Doug Miller, director of competitive strategy for Microsoft's Windows division, declined to say whether Microsoft planned to create a 64-bit version of Windows for Hammer. But he said the current emphasis is on Intel's chips, and supporting new chips isn't undertaken lightly. "Right now our focus is on Itanium," Miller said. "The thought of doing another platform is a scary proposition." McCarron expects a Windows version eventually. "It would not take a huge amount of effort for them to do that," he said. "I would be very surprised if there wasn't at some point Windows support for 64-bit AMD products." The 64-bit chips aren't the only products for which the companies are trying to secure Linux support. Intel is working not only with Microsoft but also with the major Linux companies to make sure their operating systems can support a new chip technology called hyperthreading, which essentially lets a computer with a single CPU act like a dual-processor system, said Intel spokesman Seth Walker. Hyperthreading, built into Pentium 4 and new Xeon chips, is arriving in early 2002, Brookwood said. And AMD this week announced that the major Linux sellers--Red Hat, MandrakeSoft, Caldera International, Turbolinux and SuSE--have certified the new dual-processor server design.
2003-02-18 - Chip paths diverge at Intel    Chips in desktops and notebooks will start to go their separate ways in 2003 with the introduction of two new processor families that Intel will tout this week at its Developer Forum. During the four-day conference in San Jose, Calif., the company will provide further details on Prescott, a successor to the Pentium 4, coming later this year, as well as the Pentium-M, a new type of notebook chip debuting March 12. Additionally, the company will shed light on upcoming Itanium and Xeon chips for servers, various wireless projects, and the "corporate stable platform," a new technique that will allow corporate buyers to buy new PCs with the latest processors without having to go through the expense and hassle of altering the uniform software image that gets burned onto every company PC, said Pat Gelsinger, Intel's chief technology officer. "The strategy in effect is to stabilize the software but advancing the hardware underneath," he said. Also this week, rival Advanced Micro Devices will hold briefings on its Opteron family of chips, while Nvidia, Rambus and others will unveil product plans at the convention or in nearby hotel suites. Prescott and the Pentium-M--formerly known as Banias--will mark an evolutionary breaking point. Right now, Intel desktop and notebook chips come with slightly different capabilities, but derive from the same basic design. By contrast, the Pentium-M will feature a distinct design geared toward reducing power consumption and will be optimized to run in wireless computers. Intel, in fact, will begin to tout how the chip and companion wireless components have been certified to work with networking gear from Cisco Systems, according to sources. By the end of 2003, the Pentium-M will become the predominant notebook chip from Intel, according to Don MacDonald, director of mobile platforms at Intel. Desktop chip Prescott, meanwhile, will sport LaGrande, a security technology that prevents outsiders from sniffing a hard drive, and hyperthreading, an inheritance from the Pentium 4 that lets a single chip behave to some degree like two. Pentium-M, for now, will have neither feature. Some technologies developed for one family will migrate to others, but divergence will be increasingly apparent, Intel executives have said. The Pentium-M will debut at speeds ranging from 900MHz to 1.6GHz, slower than Prescott, which will likely hit 3.5GHz or higher, according to sources. Other expected highlights of the conference include the following: Chipsets: Intel will discuss Springdale chipsets coming in March. These chipsets will raise the bus speed of the Pentium 4 from 400MHz to 800MHz, boosting overall performance, as well as allow PC makers to cheaply adopt Serial ATA, a high-speed method for connecting hard drives. Springdale, and an accompanying 3.2GHz Pentium 4, will also pave acceptance for hyperthreading in the corporate world. IBM and Dell Computer now ship Pentium 4s with hyperthreading off, but will switch with Springdale, Intel representatives have said. Servers: More details will emerge on Madison, a 1.5GHz version of Itanium coming this summer; Deerfield, an energy-efficient Itanium processor for blade servers; and Montecito, a version of Itanium coming in 2005 that will have two processing cores, 18MB of level three cache, and a billion transistors. Manufacturing: Chips using the 90-nanometer process will start to emerge in the second half of the year. These chips will contain smaller transistors and run at higher clock speeds than chips made on the 130-nanometer process. Additionally, they will contain "strained silicon," a layer of silicon germanium for extra performance. Prescott and Dothan, a 90-nanometer version of Banias, will be two of the first chips made on the 90-nanometer process. Researchers will also likely discuss how they have successfully completed masks--templates for laying down circuits--for 65-nanometer manufacturing, which will begin in 2005. Making a mask, which costs millions and involves extensive research and testing, is a crucial step. Wireless and networking: There will be updates on mesh networks, which allow users to hop across different networks wirelessly, and ultrawideband technology. Intel will also likely release chips for the telecommunications and networking equipment market. Cellular: Manitoba, Intel's first microprocessor targeted at cell phones, will be on display. The company, meanwhile, will discuss plans on future Xscale processors and efficient ways for packing more flash memory into portable devices cheaply. New technologies: On the final day of the conference, Gelsinger will outline different experiments Intel is conducting in location-based computing, or software that "knows" where an individual is by data culled from his or her past behavior, as well as in the life sciences area. Like STMicroelectronics, Intel has designed a silicon chip that can be used to test DNA samples from bodily fluids, the same sort of thing that now requires lab equipment. Intel is still tinkering with the potentially lucrative technology behind many of these futuristic projects as well as how to approach them as a business. The company may eventually make some of these devices or merely license the technology, Gelsinger said. "Some of the manufacturability and packaging issues of MEMS (microelectromechanical systems), or machines made on silicon, (another Intel research project), is not well solved yet," he said.

2004-06-04 - Chinese supercomputer headed to top ranks  A Chinese supercomputer, the Dawning 4000A, is expected to rank high on an upcoming list of the fastest machines, underscoring geopolitical effects of a new approach to high-performance computing. Dawning Information Industry, a Chinese company that makes everything from PCs to supercomputers, is building the system for Chinese research institutes and corporations. The machine, with more than 2,000 of Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron processors, likely will rank high on the latest list of the 500 fastest computers, due June 22. "They're expecting it to be in the top 15, based on the numbers they're seeing," said Guy Ludden, marketing manager of AMD's high-performance computing group. When AMD announced the Dawning 4000A in 2003, it predicted a speed surpassing 10 trillion calculations per second, or 10 teraflops. On the most recent Top500 Supercomputer list, only three systems surpassed 10 teraflops, though more are expected to arrive this month. Countries with supercomputing prowess such as the United States have long sought to restrict the export of high-performance calculation technology that could be used for nuclear weapons design or communications decryption. Those export laws have tripped up companies such as Sun Microsystems. But a newer approach, in which numerous low-end Linux systems are connected with a high-speed network into a high-performance computing cluster, means supercomputers can be built from widespread, ordinary technology. The new approach, popular for engineering tasks at companies such as Boeing and DaimlerChrysler, has shaken up the Top500 list. The list is updated twice annually, and more changes to the list are expected with its next iteration, due June 22 at the International Supercomputer Conference, ISC2004. NEC's Earth Simulator has led the supercomputing list since June 2002 with a 35.8-teraflop speed. When the November list arrives, however, the system could be unseated by Cray's Red Storm at Sandia National Laboratories. That computer is expected to clock in at 40 teraflops. "Red Storm should, hopefully, be on the fall list," Ludden said. A likely candidate for the upcoming June list, a California Digital system called Thunder at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has more than 4,000 Itanium 2 processors and has already posted a speed of 19.9 teraflops. At Los Alamos National Laboratory, another cluster system, called Linux Networx's Lightning, is also expected to exceed 10 teraflops. A more traditional design from Cray, to be built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is expected to reach 50 teraflops. And Blue Gene/L, a hybrid between exotic designs and more standard clusters at the Livermore lab, is expected to reach 360 teraflops in 2005. At that speed, IBM says it is confident its machine will be the fastest in the world.
2003-07-25 - China AMD team on Opteron supercomputer    China plans to create the world's third most powerful supercomputer, which will also be among the first such machines to use the Opteron processor from U.S. chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices. According to China's People's Daily, Chinese supercomputer maker Dawning Information Industry will use 2,000 of these chips to make the Dawning 4000A, with help from AMD. The 4000A will be a cluster comprised of computers that run a Chinese-designed Linux operating system and mainboard chips, the report said, and will aim to hit 10 teraflops in computing power. According to the Top500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers, the top spot is held by the NEC Earth Simulator in Japan, with a 36-teraflop rating. This machine uses 5,120 vector processors, special chips that execute computational operations at a high speed with a single instruction. The second and third spots were occupied by two identical HP systems called ASCI Q at Los Alamos National Laboratory that now have been combined into one with a 14-teraflop speed. The system uses 8,192 Alpha processors. When the 4000A is ready for delivery next June--and assuming that the Top500 list remains unchanged--it will knock the third-place Linux Networx system with 2,304 Xeon processors, at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, off its perch. The highest ranking so far for a Chinese company on the chart was 43, achieved by the Legend Group last year, the report observed. For China, the race to make powerful computers is a matter of national pride; the country ranks the activity, along with space exploration and genetic research, as key indicators of national progress. The announcement of the 4000A sheds light on an AMD press release accidentally leaked in late June, which mentioned collaboration with a Chinese firm to build a supercomputer using AMD's new 64-bit Opteron processor. The recently launched Opteron is aimed at corporate server computers and competes with Intel's Itanium 2. AMD has yet to make an official announcement on the Dawning 4000A, and AMD in Singapore could not give more details at press time. However, by the time the Chinese machine is launched, it may well have been outclassed by faster Opteron-based supercomputers. According to information on AMD's Web site, the company is working with U.S. supercomputer maker Cray on a massive 10,000-Opteron unit called Red Storm for the U.S. Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M. When ready next year, its 40-teraflop rating could leave the NEC Earth Simulator in the shade. John Lui of CNETAsia reported from Singapore.
2003-10-09 - Charting Sun's new chip strategy   After years of boasting about the advantages of a single-processor computing architecture, Sun Microsystems is changing with the times. Under pressure from rivals, the company has begun to incorporate lower-end "x86" chips into its product lines. "We see Sun offering certain x86-based products," said David Yen, a 15-year veteran who runs the company's processor group. "In other words, for some of the (chip areas), we will not waste any of our resources to pursue that. Maybe an Intel solution or an AMD solution is good enough." It's probably a good idea. Unix systems built around proprietary chips have traditionally powered most of the servers in high-end data processing computers. But in the second quarter of 2002, IDC reported that more money was being spent on Intel-based servers for the first time. The decision to let x86, or Intel-compatible, processors into the fold wasn't as difficult as it might seem at first blush. Sun has been trying for months to redefine itself as a company that sells integrated collections of hardware and software--systems, as company executives are fond of saying. The job of making all this fall into place falls to Yen, who discussed his views with CNET News.com about changes in chip technology as well as Sun's overhaul of the UltraSparc family following its acquisition of Afara Websystems. Q: So do you think Itanium is doomed? A: It is an architecture that's kind of inspired by the late '70s high-performance computing--in other words a pretty narrow focus, and yet trying to get applied in the '90s for a general-purpose computing environment. Certainly there have been rumors from the beginning that Intel has sunk multiple billions of dollars into this program. On top of that, their image and self-respect--everything is at stake. So I think they will continue carrying Itanium. But...they knew the consequences of their decision. They knew they broke the binary compatibility (preventing programs written for x86 chips to run easily on Itanium chips). They knew they had to re-create an ecosystem. Probably they have such high confidence on their resourcefulness and their "macho-ness" that think they can overcome. Sun actually tried it (breaking binary compatibility) several years back...but after we provided the compilers and ported the operating system, we looked at it on the applications side and eventually threw in the towel. We know how formidable it is to try to create a new software environment. They created such an opportunity for AMD, which came in and did an incremental 32-bit to 64-bit extension on the foundation of the Athlon design in a relatively short time with Opteron. A huge advantage is they allow a customer to continue running their 32-bit applications. How do you think Intel will respond? Intel certainly recognized (the Opteron threat) a year or two ago...If you look at Prescott, if you look at some of the new (chips)--in particular some of those coming up in 2004--Intel's very quietly putting something called a 64-bit extension in. I think Intel will have to address this vulnerability created by Itanium versus Opteron. They need a better defense. So Intel put a 64-bit extension into Prescott? Yeah. With 64-bit memory addressing? With their 64-bit architecture, they will allow programs to have 64-bit addressability. I suspect there also will be 64-bit registers and 64-bit function units. But basically it's an Opteron-type of compatible design. You're getting pushed on one end by IBM and by Dell on another. Are you in danger of finding yourself in a revenue death spiral? Texas Instruments helps with chip manufacturing, but is Sun going to be big enough to invest in processor technology? Isn't the fact that you've let Intel in at the low end an admission of the new economic reality? Frankly speaking, there's not much difference designing a data processor chip versus designing a full system. Frankly speaking, there's not much difference designing a data processor chip versus designing a full system. Nobody criticizes a system company, saying they invest too much money building their own hardware system. And yet people think that investing in R&D to build your own processor is too much to bear. My section is only a small section of Sun's $2 billion (spent annually) in R&D. In fact, more and more system parts are actually being absorbed into the processor chip. You always need a processor. But then with more capacity and more capability, what do you do? You absorb. Either you try to have SMP (symmetrical multiprocessing) on a chip-- Multicore processors? Yep. Or if the processor is good enough, and yet only costs a fraction of the possible die size, then you start absorbing the memory controller, the networking interface, the crypto logic--everything you can think of onto that chip. Probably the only thing you should do without is the DRAM (the computer's main memory). If that's the case, some of the system companies only have two choices. One is to retain their microelectronics capabilities so that they will be forever able to control their own destiny and do their own hardware, whether on the chip or on the board. Or you have to rely on the chip industry to supply you with all the parts and you become a system integrator. Your Niagara processor (scheduled to debut in 2005 or 2006) will be the first of a new family of multicore processors. What's happening with the higher-end S series successors to Niagara? We actually have multiple projects. Three projects? Four? More than two. Will UltraSparc VI be on the UltraSparc V lineage, or something that's going to pick up from the Afara side (where the Niagara technology originated)? The issue is the balance. On the one hand, we strongly believe in the supercomputing vision, and that inspired a lot of good ideas. Still, all today's businesses are based on these more traditional processors...So how do you allocate resources to pursue some of these more incremental developments, versus a new product, a new vision, a new architecture? That is the challenge. We're not religious. We want to keep our options open. I think you will see in the next six to 12 months Sun make significant steps--particularly in the processor area--to allow the processor group to transition from a more incremental development scenario to a more aggressive, next generation of processor scenario. Have you considered using IBM to build your chips? They build for example the PA-RISC line for HP. We actually did have an interaction with IBM, especially last year, because of their strong desire to acquire more customers to help amortize their new 300-millimeter (a larger silicon wafer size) fab investment...(but) there are so many additional considerations. From a product side, they are certainly competing with us. We're not religious. We want to keep our options open. In the last two years, we did (a review), not just with IBM but with several potential fab candidates. Every time, we came to the very objective conclusion that we have one of the best partners. How about the Power architecture? It seems that's closer to Sun's philosophy. How do you see IBM as a competitive threat? I think the Power4 project was a good one. Power5 is an enhancement in the right direction...But IBM is IBM. It is probably going to (be) more conservative. IBM probably can make up some of that conservatism with the fact that they also own the system and maybe the operating system, assuming they aren't dumping AIX--or they can extend Linux to the point where it really is efficient and scalable. IBM is moving "hypervisor" technology onto the chip (giving the chip control over hardware resources so the server is more flexible and can be partitioned better into smaller independent servers). All the new Sparc processors, including Niagara and follow-ons, will include a "hypervisor" layer. That will provide us extra flexibility to somewhat decouple the operating system and the underlying hardware platform, which may translate into a faster release cycle. Would that make it easier to move a task from one processor to another? Or is it an abstraction layer where you can change from one chip design to the next chip design without the software needing to know? It's an extra layer of abstraction. Once it's done, the hardware has bigger flexibility to make certain changes without disturbing the Solaris operating system. The challenge there is you don't want to degrade the performance. You want to make that layer very lean and mean, and yet provide the abstraction and, therefore, flexibility.
2002-09-19 - CEOs called to court in patent case    A federal court has asked the chief executive officers of Intergraph and Intel to appear in court in an effort to resolve the remaining issues in a patent infringement case. The judge presiding over the Intergraph suit filed against Intel has ordered senior executives from the companies to appear at a mediation slated for Sept. 26, an Intel spokesman said. The judge has specifically requested that the CEOs of both companies attend in an effort to settle the matter. "Someone senior will be there," an Intel spokesman said, although it is uncertain if CEO Craig Barrett will attend. Intergraph representatives could not be reached for comment. The case is being heard at the U.S. District Court in Marshall, Texas. Intergraph alleges that the intellectual property underlying Intel's Itanium processor infringes the company's patents. In , the two companies settled other patent disputes in the case, with Intel paying Intergraph $300 million. Two patent claims remain. Although Intergraph and Intel have yet to settle on these remaining issues, they have agreed to a ceiling on damages. Intergraph can collect up to $150 million (on top of the $300 million it has already been awarded) if it wins at trial. If Intel appeals a verdict not in its favor and loses the appeal, it will pay Intergraph an additional $100 million. Intergraph in the late 1980s and early 1990s manufactured a chip known as "Clipper" to power its workstations. In 1993, it scrapped the effort and switched to Intel chips. The company now focuses on services and software. Intergraph originally filed suit in an Alabama federal court in November 1997, alleging Intel violated antitrust laws, infringed on Intergraph patents, and violated state laws.
2005-02-09 - Cell chip Hit or hype  Will the Cell processor be the new Itanium? At the International Solid-State Circuits Conference on Monday, the joint developers of the long-awaited processor--Sony, Toshiba and IBM--unveiled a number of the details about it amid a surge of dramatic speculation. The New York Times said the chip could create "a new digital computing ecosystem that includes Hollywood, the living room and high-performance scientific and engineering markets." Others speculated that the chip could drive everything from cell phones to servers, tying them into a grand computing grid. "We believe a 10x performance over the PC, at the same power envelope, can be achieved," said IBM's Dac Pham, one of the designers of Cell. "It will usher in a new era of media-centered computing." This sort of excitement and speculation about chips is driven by the "Battlestar Galactica" principle. Intel's limping Itanium debuted with a similar level of fanfare. In 1994, the Microprocessor Report, examining the investment Intel planned to put behind the chip, predicted that it would become commonplace in desktops by 2004. It didn't happen. Similarly, feelings ran high about the Emotion Engine, the microprocessor inside the original PlayStation 2 game console. Analysts said it could undercut chips from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices in PCs, and become the nerve center for DVD players and other home electronics. Toshiba even created a company, Artile, to license the Emotion. But the Emotion Engine never migrated outside the PlayStation, and Toshiba snuffed out Artile in 2003. The PlayStation 2, meanwhile, didn't live up to the suggestion that it would serve as a conduit for movies, TV, e-mail and the Internet. This sort of excitement and speculation about chips is driven by what I call the "Battlestar Galactica" principle. It goes as follows: If the domination of the universe isn't contested on a weekly basis, ratings will go down. Analysts, reporters, consumers and even executives need a gladiatorial contest to keep the job interesting. The high-public profile of Sun Microsystems can partly be attributed to its role as the William Shatner of computing--donning a new uniform every three seasons to battle a new nemesis. Put in that perspective, the Cell story starts to look different. Cell will be a victory if it doesn't lead to layoffs. Going by papers presented at ISSCC, Cell looks like a tremendous achievement. However, this is the chip industry: Only a handful of companies--Samsung, Intel, Texas Instruments and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.--consistently produce profits. Most everyone else is seemingly always two steps away from the trailer park. Over the past few years, IBM Microelectronics has often reported quarterly losses. Cell will be a victory if it doesn't lead to layoffs. In all likelihood, Cell will sell in far greater numbers than the just-as-trumpeted Itanium. Sony will put it into the PlayStation 3 video console. Unless gamers lose interest in stock cars, ninja stars and wiping out space aliens between now and 2006, that thing will sell. IBM and Toshiba will put it in products, too. Still, whether the chip will be able to enter different markets is another question that hinges on factors such as: Size: Cell contains 234 million transistors and takes up 221 square millimeters in the 90-nanometer production process. That's about double the size of the 90-nanometer 3.6GHz Pentium 4, with 112 square millimeters and 125 million transistors. Why invite your rival to your top-secret design meetings? Big chips cost more to produce, can hide more bugs and can be tough to cram into portable devices. Cell will get cheaper when it goes to 65-nanometer production, but so will the alternatives. Cost: Remember liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS)? The chip that would bring down the price of big-screen TVs? Intel and Brilliant Technologies failed at it. JVC and Sony succeeded. However, the latter two companies sell their LCOS chips to their own television units. The cost of the chip gets absorbed into the TV set. Sony, Toshiba and IBM don't have to worry about the cost of Cell because they will sell it to themselves. It becomes part of a product that is tagged at a slightly higher price. An expensive Cell, however, will be a tough sell to any other manufacturers. Alliances: Consumer electronics companies won't want to buy a processor from Sony and Toshiba. Similarly, not a lot of server manufacturers will line up to buy a Cell server chip from IBM. Why invite your rival to your top-secret design meetings? Power: Cell will have to be air-cooled, IBM said. In other words, fans will probably be required. Ever talk on a cell phone with a fan? While IBM didn't disclose the exact heat statistics, some at ISSCC said it could run as hot as 130 watts, more than most desktop and notebook chips. If Cell is in this range, kids will really be huddled around the PlayStation 3 at Christmas--for warmth. On the cool engineering side, however, the chip will come with 10 digital heat sensors to warn of problems and another sensor to regulate temperature. Memory: Cell comes with an integrated memory controller for high-performance XDR memory from Rambus--which means that the current design works exclusively with this pricey stuff. Sony used an earlier version of Rambus memory in the PlayStation, but it's been a tough sell outside of consumer electronics. Cell is an outstanding achievement. But we have to wait and see whether it can get a job from someone other than its parents.
2005-03-31 - Can HP's 'Super' server save Itanium   Intel's Itanium could get a boost by early 2006 when Hewlett-Packard releases a top-end server designed for the chip, though skeptics doubt the machine will be enough to turn around the beleaguered processor's fortunes. HP's new top-end Superdome, like current models, has sockets to accommodate as many as 64 Itanium processors. But unlike current models, it will support the new Montecito and Montvale versions of Itanium, which are expected to boost performance substantially. Most activity in the server market is happening elsewhere, however, said Sageza Group analyst Clay Ryder. "Even in the realm of Superdomes, how many of these does the world need in one given year? It's hard to push sales upward on high-end systems when the mediocre midrange of computing will exceed the needs of 99 percent of the market." News.context What's new: HP's upcoming top-end Superdome will support the new Montecito and Montvale versions of Itanium, which are expected to boost performance substantially. Bottom line: The Superdome server could provide a boost to the beleaguered Itanium family. But skeptics say that even if Itanium succeeds in the relatively narrow high-end market, that won't necessarily be enough to keep the processor alive. More stories on Itanium HP and Intel believe the new Itanium chips will dramatically boost performance, though. The chips include dual processing engines, called cores, and technology called multithreading that lets each core handle two instruction sequences at the same time. But a faster chip means a greater appetite for data. "With dual-core and multithreading, you're going to need a new pipe to keep it fed," said Brian Cox, a product line manager for HP's high-end servers. While the Itanium chips handle computing chores, the essential task of data transfer within the server is handled by a chipset code-named Arches. It's the third-generation Superdome chipset after the initial Yosemite model and the current Pinnacles. (The chipsets are named after national parks and monuments; Yosemite is home to the famous Half Dome peak that also was an early code name for Superdome.) The Superdome release timing isn't clear. Intel plans to release the Montecito processor in late 2005, and HP will follow soon after. "When it's ready, it's ready," Cox said of the next Superdome. "We're waiting for full-speed silicon from Intel on the chips." As with Pinnacles--officially called the sx1000--the Arches chipset also will be used in midrange systems with eight or 16 processor sockets, HP said. For smaller machines with one to four sockets, HP will use a chipset code-named Titan, a successor to the zx1 code-named Pluto. The developments show HP's continuing commitment to Itanium, a chip family the company helped Intel develop as a replacement to its own PA-RISC family. Itanium, however, has fallen far short of its conquer-the-server-world expectations. Intel missed a 2004 Itanium goal of doubling 2003 shipments to 200,000, but there has been some progress: According to Gartner, sales of Itanium servers more than tripled to $1.6 billion in 2004. Itanium still has skeptics. "The issue with Itanium and HP is one of volume," Ryder said. "This is the platform they bet the company on. For all the years we heard HP and Intel hyping this thing, what we have achieved today is kind of what we expected to see in 1999." And there's serious competition. IBM's Power5-based p5-595 trounced Itanium in a recent server speed test. And while much of Sun Microsystems' current attention is aimed at its lower-end machines, a partnership with Fujitsu and the high-end Rock processors could boost its fortunes. HP points to some successes, though. There are 500 customers using Itanium systems to run their business software from SAP--a demanding and essential computing task--and 40 of the world's 100 largest companies are customers, said Mark Hudson, vice president of marketing for HP's Enterprise Storage and Servers group. Not alone Also in HP's favor: It isn't alone in the Itanium market. Fujitsu plans to announce its 64-processor Itanium server Tuesday in San Francisco, sources familiar with the plan said. The more Itanium server sellers there are--IBM's coolness notwithstanding--the easier it is to persuade customers and software companies that the products are mainstream. Intel once envisioned Itanium as suitable for the entire server market but now has retreated to the high end. That's not a great place to be, judging by the failures of Compaq Computer's Alpha processor and the fading fortunes of Silicon Graphics' MIPS, said Gabriel Consulting analyst Dan Olds. "A processor cannot survive as only a high-end alternative. There simply isn't enough volume to support development and production," Olds said. "Itanium will become merely a replacement for HP's PA-RISC chip--albeit with less software and industry support." Another complication is the overlap between Intel's Itanium family and its lower-end Xeon family. Xeon can run widely used software written for x86 processors such as Pentium and is gradually becoming more powerful. With a new generation of Xeon processors this week, though, HP reduced the Itanium-Xeon overlap. Previously, HP developed its own chipset for eight-processor Xeon machines, but the company now develops only four-processor Xeon servers. High-end servers, used for essential tasks such as tracking company inventory and orders, are a choice market. The machines typically are used for years, and securing a place at the heart of a customer's network can lead to sales of storage equipment, services and lower-end servers. Machines with dozens of processors and hundreds of gigabytes of memory are rarely used to tackle a single problem, though. More often they're split into independent partitions that handle separate jobs. "Today, most of these are carved up," Cox said. The upgrade option Existing Superdome customers will be able to upgrade to the Arches components without getting rid of the system chassis, Cox said. That could be helpful, given that a full-size Superdome is about the size of two refrigerators. However, as with the upgrade from Yosemite to Pinnacles, customers will have so swap out not just the electronics boards that house the processors, but also the communications back-plane that links those boards together, Cox said. Upgrading to Montvale, a faster successor to Montecito due in 2006, will only require processor boards to be changed, Cox said. After that comes the Tukwila processor in 2007 and its successor, Poulson, but HP can't commit that existing Superdome customers will be able to upgrade to those processors.
2000-08-08 - Caldera joins Linux-on-Itanium race    A fourth major Linux seller has released a version of its operating system for Intel's upcoming Itanium chip. On Friday, Caldera posted an early version of its OpenLinux product designed for the Itanium chip, the first member of a 64-bit chip family from Intel designed to compete with Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc, Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC, SGI's MIPS, IBM's Power, and Compaq Computer's Alpha. Intel is heavily backing Linux to become one of three mainstream operating systems for the delayed chip. Under the new schedule, only a test batch of computers running on Itanium chips will come out this year. Systems for commercial consumption will arrive in the first half of 2001. Caldera's biggest competitors, TurboLinux, Red Hat and SuSE, have already released test versions of Linux for Itanium. All the companies have cautioned that their releases are prototypes, though, and Caldera is no exception. The company's Itanium twist lacks the slick Lizard installer, some password management software or the X Windows graphical systems. Microsoft's 64-bit version of Windows is in a similar state of unreadiness. Microsoft shipped a test version to developers last month. HP, the co-inventor of the IA-64 architecture, also has been backing the Linux-on-Itanium effort. HP Labs' David Mosberger has led the effort to create a version of Linux for IA-64, and HP has released simulator software that allows programmers with ordinary 32-bit Intel machines to see if their 64-bit software will work. Caldera, with its recent acquisition of Santa Cruz Operation's Unix software line, will have a tighter relationship with IA-64 chips than most Linux companies. SCO's UnixWare, along with IBM's AIX, is a key component of the "Monterey-64" version of Unix that will run on Itanium.
2003-04-22 - BP buys massive Itanium cluster    Petrochemical giant BP has purchased a large cluster of Hewlett-Packard Linux servers using Intel's Itanium 2 processors to help search for oil and gas deposits. BP bought 259 HP rx5670 systems, each with four Itanium 2 processors. The systems collectively have more than 8,000GB of memory and can perform 4 trillion calculations per second, according to HP and Intel. The purchase price was not disclosed. The computing cluster will be used for the computationally difficult task of seismic processing, in which computers deduce 3D models of what lies beneath the Earth's surface--petrochemicals, for example. They reconstruct these interior features by analyzing how fast sound waves from a man-made explosion travel through different materials before reaching an array of sensitive detectors. Supercomputing and high-performance technical computing is gaining interest from server sellers. IBM expanded its effort Tuesday to include more products and services personnel. Sun Microsystems is increasing its emphasis as well. Market researcher IDC said $4.7 billion worth of high-performance technical computing systems were sold in 2002, with HP leading the market but IBM encroaching fast. Intel's Xeon and Pentium processors have often been used for computing clusters, collections of computers that divide a job among dozens or hundreds of lower-end computers. But the 64-bit Itanium family has been catching on with the arrival of the faster Itanium 2 model and improved software. Longtime Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices now poses some more competition in this market. On Tuesday, AMD launched its new Opteron processor that, like Intel's Itanium processor, can handle large amounts of memory more effectively than can Xeon and Pentium models. At the Opteron launch on Tuesday, IBM said it will sell Opteron-based computing clusters.
2001-01-06 - Blue Martini continues happy week  Shares of Blue Martini Software surged Thursday after the company said it had inked an engineering, marketing and sales deal with Intel. The software companys stock continued its strong recent run, moving up 1.84 to 15.15. Intel slipped 0.31 to 32.25. Blue Martinis stock has rebounded of late after being downgraded by Goldman Sachs earlier this month. The company surged 50 percent on Tuesday after it was cited as one of Readerman's Stock Picks in Barron's. Under today's agreement, Blue Martini (Nasdaq: BLUE) will integrate its business-to-business customer integration software for the Intel Corp.s (Nasdaq: INTC) Pentium Xeon and upcoming Itanium chips. In addition to technological cooperation, the companies will jointly promote and market the integrated platform.
2004-11-09 - Blue Gene Linux top supercomputing list    After two and a half years at the top of a list of the world's fastest supercomputers, NEC's Earth Simulator has finally been dethroned: IBM's Blue Gene/L officially is the new king of the hill. The Blue Gene/L succession, while expected, reflects IBM's sustained push in recent years to expand its expertise from business computers into high-performance technical computing. On the newest incarnation of the Top500 list, updated twice a year, IBM has 216 systems, which account for 49.4 percent of list members' collective performance. The ascendance also highlights the rise of Linux, the open-source operating system that Blue Gene/L runs and that IBM helped to champion. The new No. 2 system, Silicon Graphics' Columbia, also uses Linux. Blue Gene/L performed 70.7 trillion calculations per second, or teraflops, nearly twice the 35.9 teraflops of Earth Simulator. And as expected, Columbia was clocked at 51.9 teraflops. IBM's new MareNostrum, at 20.5 teraflops, arrived in fourth place. The Top500 list is compiled by Hans Meuer of the University of Mannheim in Germany, Erich Strohmaier and Horst Simon of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Jack Dongarra of the University of Tennessee. It was released Monday at the SC2004 supercomputing conference in Pittsburgh. Computers are scored by the Linpack benchmark, a convenient measurement but even list organizers recognize it is an incomplete measurement of real-world ability. Top-end supercomputers use thousands of processors, draw power measured in megawatts and occupy entire floors of buildings. But less and less often are they based on exotic or specialized computing technology. A total of 236 of the 500 systems use the same Intel Xeon processors that show up in the majority of off-the-shelf servers. That's up from 226 in the June list. Systems using Intel Itanium processors, another mainstream alternative and the chip used in Columbia, increased from 61 to 87 over the same period. Thirty systems use Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron--another common server chip--compared to 32 in June. IBM's Power family of processors are used in 62 systems, down from 75 in June. Supercomputers assembled from these more ordinary components are connected into massive clusters that pass messages and share each others' memory over high-speed networks. Clusters now account for 296 of the 500 systems on the list. IBM and HP dominate the computer manufacturers on the list. IBM slipped from 224 systems in June to 216 systems, while HP grew from 140 to 173. In the entire supercomputing market, Big Blue is getting bigger and nearing HP's top rank. From 2002 to 2003, IBM's share of the market grew from 28.2 percent to 30.2 percent with sales of $1.62 billion, according to IDC. HP, with $1.79 billion in revenue for 2003, shrank slightly from 33.6 percent to 33.5 percent. A few years ago, a "terascale" computer--one that could perform more than a trillion calculations per second--was a remarkable achievement. Indeed, in 1993, the total performance of all 500 machines was 1.12 teraflops. Now, 398 of the systems on the list have crossed the teraflop threshold, and the total performance has reached 1.13 petaflops, or quadrillion calculations per second. The slowest machine on the list was 851 gigaflops, or 0.851 teraflops. Japan long has had a place on the list, but now other Asian countries are rising. Thirty of the top machines were in Japan and 57 in other Asian countries, including 17 in China.
2000-09-04 - Bishop takes the heat as SGI mounts recovery effort    "You're welcome to pull the arrows out of my back." This is how SGI chief executive Bob Bishop jokes about attacks he took from investors and Wall Street for streamlining the company during the past year. Once known as Silicon Graphics, SGI morphed during the year from a company selling supercomputers, large servers, multimedia software and embedded chips used in consumer devices into one catering to just a few markets: technical and scientific computing and digital content creation. Along the way, Bishop shed four divisions, including the well-known Cray Computer operation, and advanced SGI's aggressive push into Linux. But the changes meant a continuous string of one-time charges and uncertainty about SGI's future. The company's stock price plummeted, and Bishop had the misfortune of delivering quarter after quarter of losses. Bishop took the hot seat Aug. 23, 1999. With his first year at SGI's helm behind him, new products to market and the start of a new fiscal year, Bishop is optimistic, feisty and even psychic. He told CNET News.com's Joe Wilcox that he expects a return to profitability in fiscal 2001. CNET News.com: You took it on the chin from Wall Street over the streamlining. Bishop: I decided to take all the hits. I knew when I came to this job I'd have to take the hits, and I took the hits. All of those steps had consequences: a number of one-shot charges in the books as we do this. The financial community had to look closely at what was going on, because it affected our tax position, affected our revenue position, head count, cost of goods, gross margins, every number. I spent a year trying to explain this. I'm actually happy that in our fiscal 2000, which ended June 30, we really got through it all. I'm just delighted we're off to such a fresh start in fiscal 2001, and we have the entire product portfolio to the market. Those steps you took involved cutting loose four divisions. What can you tell me about letting Cray go? I divested four pieces to get simplicity, clarity and full alignment. That's why I did it. We started by divesting Cray, so we're out of the vector (computing) business. We could not marry...a vector and parallel (computing) architecture. There's a religious difference, and we rightly concluded this marriage doesn't work, so we divested the vector piece and kept 800 Cray people and the lion's share of the technology. We chose the pieces to integrate with the parallel architecture. We're quite happy with what we did. And now the 800 people from Cray that stayed with us are highly motivated SGI people. There's no religious difference anymore. You also cut loose your MIPS chip business and some share value with it. Why? We're 100 percent committed to the MIPS-Irix product line. We had built an embedded chip business, embedded into consumer products. It was highly successful; there were approximately 50 million chips per year being shipped into consumer products. For example, Sony PlayStation...and...Nintendo 64--they all run on MIPS. Laser printers, automobiles, and all different products. But it did not fulfill our mission, our sweet spot, focused on the technical computing user from a system point of view. So we divested that. Keep in mind the designers for the high-end MIPS are still in our company. And we have a road map to take MIPS from 400 MHz today out through 1 GHz in the near future. Where are you now after the divestitures? The consequences on the remaining part of the company--about 6,800 employees--is a highly focused, streamlined operation focused on a single mission. And the sweet spot of that single mission is the technical communities. You are now focusing on technical and scientific computing and creative content, such as film production. But haven't you backed yourself into a niche market? Our revenue is only about $2.5 billion, but we estimate that market to be $25 billion. We only have 10 percent of that market and lots of room to grow. You've had a string of unprofitable quarters. Do you expect a turnaround during fiscal 2001? We've given guidance to Wall Street at our last call on July 20 that we would be profitable for the full fiscal year 2001 and that we would be growing the revenues somewhere between 15 and 20 percent. That's the guidance we gave Wall Street, and we're on target to do that. So you are 100 percent confident the rough times are over? We did the turn. Emotionally, the company's turned. And it's getting runs on the board. Getting runs on the board is pretty important to Wall Street. You can't change their game. That's their game. We're back. We're back quite strong. The products are great, and the motivation in the company's quite high right now. What's one of SGI's biggest failings? We've sown the seeds of innovation but failed to harvest them. Someone else has come along with stronger marketing capability or putting in lower-cost systems and found a way to harvest our work. I'm anxious to learn how to harvest more of what we sow. We are truly respected as the central innovator in this space, but we truly have not harvested volume, nor profits, from this effort. In July, you unveiled the Origin 3000 server and pinned much of the company's future on the product line. How is it doing? We had $100 million in advance orders and feel strong about what we have to offer. These new products are mind-boggling. These new servers have got attention. Now we've got to deliver these new products in volume, and we are dealing with a number of supply constraints in the industry, which are affecting everybody at this moment. Component shortages have hit everyone hard. How are you dealing with the problem? It's amazing how this problem is permeating the industry. We're clawing our way through it. It's a day-by-day struggle with our vendors, but we've got most of our componentry pinned down. We don't have as much upside as we want. Because we are at a point of takeoff and our booking stream is quite strong, we would like to be able to deliver more rapidly. I understand you expect Linux to account for half of SGI's revenue within five years. How does your Linux strategy interact with your proprietary technology? We offer a full line of Linux products, but only on Intel (processors). We don't offer the crossover. We're not putting Linux on MIPS. When Intel has its Itanium processor on the market, we will soon have a full range of IA-64 Linux products. The architecture is already done. The subsystems are already done. It draws upon what we've done on the MIPS-Irix side, so we don't have to redevelop this. So we're ready to go, and we think Intel will have the chip ready by the end of the year. Then our systems will follow probably in the March time frame next year. Linux is gaining momentum, but don't you think your revenue plans are aggressive? No one can truly predict the potential for Linux, but our scope of it is that it's, firstly, tightly linked to the Internet world. I think today it already occupies probably 25 percent of the servers in the Internet space. We're very focused on broadband Internet. Our servers we're looking to deploy in a broadband Internet space, where scalability and throughput become imperative. We're not talking about alphanumeric data, but visual content, interactive content, immersed content and continuous changing content. That's the world of broadband Internet. So you're talking about leveraging your technology used in creative content areas, such as film editing and digital film creation? Yes. And not just old-generation movies, the archive movies. We're talking about new-generation movies that have an interactive content component, where the viewer is immersed and has some dialog with the characters and plot. We haven't yet seen the Internet next-generation, new genre content. But if you had to compare it to anything, it would be the video game environment extended over the Internet with multiple players. That kind of content is very sophisticated, involving high-speed access to big databases. We're ready to deliver that with our new architecture. What kind of business opportunities do you foresee in this market? We think media will be sold and transacted, and instead of e-commerce we really should be talking about media commerce. That transition is under way because of the emergence of broadband Internet. We're gearing ourselves for broadband Internet. We see our new architecture fitting into that space, and Linux will be the gateway to broadband Internet. Do you plan to do more with marketing? Say, promoting your technology's use to make successful movies? We have come to a kind of rebirth, the relaunching of the company. We have committed some pretty significant funds to global promotion. For example, it's on our platform that "The Perfect Storm" special effects were developed. It's on our platform that the whole "Space Cowboys" simulations and special effects were developed. I can go on discussing this, whether you're talking "Toy Story" or "Jurassic Park." It's our stuff, and we have not taken advantage of this as we should have. For example, "The Perfect Storm" is a global phenomenon. It's a cult. And the animation and special effects are just phenomenal. We should be riding along, and our promotion should match what we've done for those customers. If you had one thing you would like to communicate to your customers, competitors and Wall Street, what would that be? We're back.
2003-04-02 - Big-bang project sparks cosmic response    Scientists in Switzerland are building a machine to test the big-bang theory of how the universe began. But first they have to construct a computer network that can handle the volumes of data the device will produce. The new, more powerful particle accelerator, known as the Large Hadron Collider, is being built at CERN, the same Swiss laboratory where Tim Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web. With such a tool, scientists say that they will either be able to produce the same particles thought to have existed when the universe was formed, or they will have proved that such particles just don't exist. But before they can test their theory, the scientists will need a computer network capable of processing and storing the massive amounts of data that will begin spewing from the collider once it starts smashing particles together in 2007. As a result, researchers at CERN created Openlab, a grid computing network designed to test the type of equipment that is likely to be standard by the middle to end of this decade when the project really gets under way. In grid computing, large numbers of desktop PCs and modestly sized servers are linked across a network in a way that allows them to function as a single, virtual supercomputer. "The hope is that we, together with partners, solve whatever bugs there are," said Francois Grey, development manager for the Openlab effort. Grey notes that the particle accelerator is likely to be up and running for a decade, meaning they not only need to predict what will be the latest and greatest technology in 2007, but also which architectures will persevere throughout the life of the project. The institute's first partners were Hewlett-Packard and Intel, which are delivering Itanium 2-based systems, as well as Enterasys Networks, which is providing 10-gigabit-per-second networking gear. On Wednesday, IBM plans to announce that it is joining the effort, providing six xSeries servers, 20 terabytes of storage as well as IBM's new Storage Tank storage management software. The computing network is designed to link thousands of scientists who will use the accelerator to try to prove the existence of particles known as Higgs bosons by recreating the conditions thought to have existed shortly after the big bang occurred. Higgs refers to Peter Higgs, the physicist who first theorized the existence of such particles, while bosons refer to the class of particles named for another physicist, S.N. Bose. In any case, Grey said scientists are pretty sure the collider will produce the conditions they need to create the particles, if they exist at all. "We are talking about, over the span of the project, billions of dollars" of investment, Grey said. "You wouldn't make this investment on a hunch." A universe of data The project involves a lot of data, which should provide IBM with fertile ground in which to test Storage Tank, said Jai Menon, an IBM Research Fellow who helped develop the software. "Where they are really leading edge or bleeding edge is the size of the data the are creating," Menon said. "They are talking about maybe generating 5 petabytes (5 million gigabytes) of data a year once they are up and running." But even with its large budget, CERN can't build its computing effort from scratch. Indeed, the agency is looking to tap existing computing and storage resources to supply much of the network's capacity. That is what makes the project interesting to Big Blue, says Tom Hawk, general manager of IBM's grid computing business. CERN's need to find a cost-effective way to manage a massive computing project while using existing computing resources is the same issue that business customers face, Hawk said, adding "not that we aren't really excited about particle physics." For HP and Intel, the project is a chance to promote the Itanium server chip as the next generation of mainstream server technology. Although many large companies are still testing Itanium-based servers, HP and CERN are betting that they will be far more widespread by the time the particle accelerator is ready. "Itanium will be mainstream, almost commodity," promised Michel Benard, a Geneva-based manager for HP's university relations program. Being included in the project is something of a coup, since there are plenty of companies touting their technology as the next big thing, said Charles King, research director of market researcher The Sageza Group in Mountain View, Calif. "There certainly have been a lot of pretenders to the throne," King said. "The CERN project provides a really interesting crucible of sorts...just being involved in the project is going to be validating to a certain extent." Plus, King said, IBM and the other participants could not ask for a better testing ground. "It's one thing to do it in your own test lab," he said. "It's another thing to be used by a third party in a pretty hard-core environment where (the technology) is being pushed to its limits." Even though CERN is just receiving the first of the giant pieces that will form the accelerator, the computing network needs to be built by 2005, Grey said. Although the accelerator will not yet be running, the scientists involved in the project will have to begin checking all of the simulation software they will use to measure and replicate the results produced by the accelerator itself.

2006-01-23 - Big Blue's big-iron x86 backer Susan Whitney has endured major changes in the half decade she's spent at the helm of IBM's Intel-based server business. But one thing has remained constant in her tenure: Big Blue's commitment to big-iron x86 servers. Intel's Xeon chip--the leading x86 model for servers, despite growing competition from Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron--is used chiefly in small dual-processor machines. But IBM believes that Xeon also is good for the massive multiprocessor systems residing at the heart of business computing operations. IBM sells machines with as many as 32 dual-core Xeon processors. That approach starkly contrasts with the two companies ahead of IBM in the x86 server market, No. 1 Hewlett-Packard and No. 2 Dell, who both withdrew eight-processor servers and now sell machines with four at maximum. Dell thinks the high end of the server market will move to clusters of smaller systems. HP believes that large server tasks are best handled by servers using Intel's Itanium chip, which has reliability features and data transfer speeds that Xeon lacks. The only player with a philosophy similar to IBM's is Sun Microsystems, which got x86 religion rather late in the game. But Sun's x86 servers still are expected to top out at eight processors, and Sun uses Opteron chips, a decision IBM disfavors. Its high-end x86 systems link chips together with the x3 chipset, which works only with Xeon. Whitney talked with CNET News.com's Stephen Shankland about her big-iron strategy, IBM's coolness toward AMD and other issues. Q: What happened in 2005 with IBM's xSeries servers, and what does 2006 hold? Whitney: When I think about last year, what I'm most excited about is clearly our blade server growth. In the third quarter, we remained in the leadership position. It is extremely efficient from a power and cooling perspective, and that remains one of the big issues that we talk about when I sit across from customers. I'm also excited about the ecosystem we're building. We have 350 partners working to bring IBM content to our BladeCenter. We've opened the specs, and an additional 300 industry participants have downloaded the specs to create content for BladeCenter. Also, with our x3 architecture, we can go from two-way to a 32-way system with the Intel-based Xeon architecture. That opens up a ton of opportunities. Q: The vast majority of the x86 servers are smaller machines. Why is IBM pushing x86 big iron? Whitney: I see many customers, usually global customers. The high-end x86 servers have three main uses: SQL Server 2005, SAP (finance software) and customers slicing and dicing (to replace many small servers with one large one). What I hear is they were waiting for SQL Server 2005 64-bit. Now that they have it, they're looking for server choices. A lot of customers are looking at their SAP implementations and deciding where they are going to go. Also, there is interest in emerging markets like banks in Russia. They didn't have any prior infrastructure. You get robust capabilities at very attractive prices. Q: But how much of yours x86 server revenue is in the high end? Whitney: We never break that out or reveal revenue by segment. The IDC data clearly show the vast majority is in the two-way space. I think that probably will continue. What I do see is a growth in the marketplace for the high-end scale-up x86 servers. I think that's because of the advent of the 64-bit capability--and there's still more to come, whether in processors, applications and the operating system. Q: As x86 machines get more powerful, don't they overlap more with your Unix servers? Whitney: What I see happening is much of low end of the Unix marketplace clearly moving to Lintel (Linux running on Intel chips). With the high end, the value proposition is different. There you have a single vendor providing the hardware, processor, server architecture, microcode and operating system. When you get that from a single vendor, you get a level of synergy and robustness that is unique. The x86 value proposition is different. The architectures come from different companies, the operating systems come from different communities or companies. When you don't have the x3 architecture, to get performance levels, you have to look for other alternatives. Q: How will 2006 differ from 2005? And what's staying the same? Whitney: I do see some continuation. When I'm talking to customers, power and cooling continues to be a major issue. Here our BladeCenters are the densest in the industry. What we and customers have done is stuck meters and probes in BladeCenter versus competitors' blade servers. Our blades, whether at rest, medium or maximum utilization, are 20 to 30 percent more efficient. That's with probes on iron, not just modeling. Second, consolidation and virtualization (work) is still a journey and represents a significant opportunity. All customers are looking for greater return on investment. When I meet a customer and go through a scenario with physical consolidation, virtualization, automation and grid, I ask customers, "Where are you in that spectrum?" Even today, Fortune 10 or 100 customers say, "I'm only a third of the way through." Some of that is because it's technical work. For large customers it's usually a governance issue as well; Intel-based servers are spread through the organization and different lines of business. Who owns it? Is corporate going to own it? Or is it, "It's my line of business and I want to keep it"? Third, still continuing is the customers' desire to reduce their operating expenses. That's where the management tools?whether lights-out data center or being able to manage all my retail outlets remotely from a single site, whether I want to have automatic provisioning of blades based on business policies and work loads?are very contemporary issues. So it's power and cooling, getting ROI--not having my server 15 percent-utilized but closer to 60 or 70 or 80 percent--and having a small team of people manage my servers. What's different? We're going to see more 64-bit processors, more dual-core processors in the marketplace. I think this message of power and cooling has clearly gotten to the processor vendors. We're going to see processors more optimized for power and cooling. I think Intel has been vocal on things like Sossaman. I think we're at the peak now in terms of processor power requirements. Q: Are we going to see big drops in processor power consumption, or just small amounts like 10 percent? Whitney: I have expectations it'll be more than incremental. Q: Opteron has some low-power benefits over Xeon. Do you foresee a time when you use Opteron in your mainstream business servers and not just your high-performance technical computing machines? Whitney: There's lots of stuff in a server. The processor is responsible for about a third of the power requirements. The rest are generated by fans and other motors and mechanical devices. You can have an optimized processor, but the other thing is to optimize the rest of that pie--the other 50 to 60 to 70 percent. That's where, because of our packaging and cooling, IBM has made the investment. For Opteron, we've been very consistent. We see AMD processors as very beneficial for specific types of applications--those that require high memory bandwidth and analytical applications. When we introduced the eServer 326, we said it was for HPC (the technical high-performance computing market), because that's what we saw. As I keep my eyes and ears to the marketplace, I see that HPC is becoming much more commercial. The analytical applications are becoming more prevalent in commercial business--whether it be drug design or risk mitigation or crash simulations. Q: But what about for mainstream servers--for example running Microsoft Exchange or databases? Whitney: I have not had customers come to me asking for that. Q: HP and Sun think Opterons are good for mainstream servers. Whitney: Other vendors don't have our x3 architecture. When you don't have the x3 architecture, to get performance levels, you have to look for other alternatives. Q: What's behind the use of Sun's Solaris operating system on BladeCenter, and how actively will IBM support that? Whitney: We are motivated by what the market wants. Many of our early adopters for BladeCenter were in financial services and telecommunications, and the customers said, "I'm migrating low-end Unix applications to Lintel." But then they'd say, "There's this the portfolio where we don't have capability, the programs are not there, we lost the documentation, the programs are not used often enough, that it's not cost justified for me to migrate it to Lintel. Can you offer a Solaris alternative?" We listened to market, and we're partnering with Sun. Q: You've been leading xSeries for five years. Are you looking for a new challenge? Whitney: I think this is the most exhilarating, fast-paced segment of the marketplace. There's a tremendous sense of satisfaction and a lot of work to be done. It's unique in terms of relations with suppliers, the partnerships you derive in the marketplace, the high-volume velocity from the supply-chain perspective. I truly find it highly energizing. As long as I'm having fun and IBM thinks I'm doing OK, I'm planning on staying.
2003-05-21 - Big Blue unites clusters blade servers IBM is combining two popular concepts in computing--Linux clusters and blade servers--into a standard system for businesses and research institutions. The Armonk, N.Y.-based computing giant plans to announce on Wednesday the IBM eServer Cluster 1350--its first prepackaged Linux-based blade cluster. The Cluster 1350 will consist of combinations of the IBM BladeCenter systems, eServer x335 and eServer x345 systems. IBM said that by testing and integrating the clusters at IBM's factories, such systems will be easier to install and manage. Technical computing customers, such as aerospace firms, are target buyers. "Customers in all segments including the very high-end are no longer interested in building their own systems," IBM Vice President David Turek said in a statement. IBM said the systems will be available June 6. Clusters and blades are in some ways a natural fit. Clusters often consist of several hundred servers. Blades, thin computers that fit into a rack, generally take up less volume than do traditional rack-mounted servers. A cluster inserted into a blade system, therefore, will take up far less room than a traditional cluster. RLX Technologies and SGI already sell such systems. Sageza Group analyst Charles King said IBM is tapping into an increasingly popular area of supercomputing. More and more of the top machines are built using Linux-based clusters, King said. Clustering is particularly popular in the life sciences industry, other analysts have said, because of the application base. "The introduction of this product speaks to the growing popularity," King said. "It's not just research labs that are doing this anymore." One reason is the falling cost of such systems, King said. "Something that might have cost $10 million or $20 million a few years ago is a fraction of that now." King said IBM is trying to outrace Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard in order to capitalize on the commercial market for high-performance computing clusters. "They think they can make a buck out of it," said King, who also expects Dell to reach for a share of the market: "It's a space I would expect to see them get into more agressively in the future." In April, IBM created a new unit, known as Deep Computing, to try to consolidate the sales efforts for such clusters. Meanwhile, HP said earlier this week that it is equipping a unit of DaimlerChrysler with a cluster that uses 200 Itanium 2 processors.
2006-01-04 - Beyond Opteron In his previous business incarnations, Phil Hester spent more than two decades at IBM, then founded a server manufacturer called Newisys. But as the (relatively) new chief technology officer at Advanced Micro Devices, that impressive resume will likely be put to the test. Appointed in September, Hester is taking on full force the future of AMD's processor designs. He replaced Fred Weber, a man who many credit with the development of AMD's Opteron chip, a key piece in the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based chipmaker's turnaround. CNET News.com recently spoke with Hester about AMD's plan to offer quad-core processors by 2007; migrate to DDR2 (a computer memory technology that, as of 2005, is becoming the mainstream standard for personal computer memory); and his vision of the next generation of Opteron and Athlon processors, including building the company's ecosystem by licensing its technology. Q: Is it true that AMD is looking at licensing parts of its architecture? Hester: The idea has been around for a while but it relates to understanding what our direct customers and the end customers want to do. The idea is to selectively license the coherent HyperTransport technology (a chip-to-chip interconnect supported by AMD and primarily used on a computer system board in distances up to 24 inches). Isn't this the technology that you have been promoting for years as a better alternative to Intel's front-side bus systems or its upcoming Common System Interconnect? Hester: Exactly. And you're going to license that to other people? Hester: Right. So the example I'd give you is in the high-performance tactical computing area, where people like Cray and others would like to do vector floating-point units. Being able to do that requires a co-processor, or attached processor elements that would attach into a standard system. We don't have any finalized plans yet, but if you look at the workloads in the data center, you're starting to see applications where, if you could accelerate XML and Java, a number of the vertical applications would perform significantly better. So instead of trying to build a machine that's just aimed at workloads, you can think about the attached processor or co-processor that works in conjunction with our AMD64 architecture to accelerate those workloads. They've canceled a heck of a lot more projects than we've canceled. What I hear is (Intel) is showing stuff that they're not going to ship for six to nine months and then comparing it to our stuff that's shipping today. Can you paint a picture of how it would look on the motherboard? Hester: The simplest way to think about it is to build an eight-way symmetric multiprocessor system based on AMD64 processors such as Opteron. Think about the ability to replace one of those with a specialized engine. This chip is really aimed at running a specific workload like vector floating-point or XML or Java. Is that technique possible today without letting that partner have knowledge of how AMD uses HyperTransport? Hester: No, you would have to have detailed knowledge in the form of a license for the coherent HyperTransport. How is this going to be a good competitive advantage for AMD's strategy? Hester: This is the concept of a friendly ecosystem that today, if you want to go build a specialized system, you really have to build all of it. Instead of building all the hardware infrastructure and the software infrastructure to support it, the idea here is that it's a lot less development expense and, in my opinion, a lot easier to leverage the standard software infrastructure that's there. Is this a radical shift in AMD's strategy? Hester: Yes and no. The nice thing about this is the AMD64 design is a reliable, high-volume cross-platform. The ecosystem is in place to support that already because it's fully compatible over the Linux and Microsoft software out there. It's also nondisruptive as you kind of move upstream. That is not the case with Itanium, for example. I think AMD now is at the point that the base hardware level is very competitive, and the question for us now is, "Okay, you have a great platform; now what do you do?" And so my bias is, once you got a base platform, you want to effectively then build on that very quickly at all levels. There'll be elements of that or hardware-enabling technologies like a license to coherent HyperTransport. There'll be work we'll do with Microsoft and the software Linux community to deal with things like ease-of-use or reliability features and recovery, and virtualization partitioning. So to me, it's the next level of focus in the industry, beyond just the raw silicon level. Let's talk about AMD's raw silicon level. Opteron and Athlon chip architectures are based on your K8 designs, previously called Hammer. Is there a K9--or Hammer 2--in the works? Hester: There's kind of two separate discussions related to that question. One is the software-visible instruction set architecture, the ISA. The second thing is the internal architecture of how you actually implement that in silicon, and so those two things are separable. Let me give you some examples. If you look at what we're doing around virtualization and security on Pacifica (which will let computers run multiple operating systems) and Presidio (a security technology that ensures separate processes can't interfere with each other), those were instruction set architecture (ISA) extensions. Obviously, hardware changes are needed under the covers to implement that, but there are those who have done so largely around the microarchitecture code that exists today. So, AMD's kind of manufacturing in strategy is roughly every quarter we've got a higher performance transistor and so you kind of keep the same underlined microarchitecture and incrementally improve new manufacturing technology. So, the structure of the microarchitecture largely stays the same. Then there is a brand new core design that has to be fully backwards compatible with the old instruction set architecture. Then you can also choose to introduce new instruction set extensions at the time of that new core. So, what you typically see is a core that lives--depending on the market segment--two to four years, and so then you want to time the introduction of a new core with major changes that you need at the system level. At that point, you could look at things like next-generation memory technology. There'll be cases where you'd want to introduce a new generation core along with the new memory technology. There will be other cases where, for example--and that's the case right now that lot of people told us--they want to keep the same base design that we've got, but go to DDR2 (Double Data Rate RAM) as opposed to Intel's FB-DIMMs (Fully-Buffered Dual Inline Memory Module). So it's really kind of listening to the ecosystem about what they want to see from us in a road map. We have a menu of things that we can do both incrementally and with new cores that are cause for discussions. So right now, our belief is that through the 2007 time frame, using new implementations of the existing core with extensions and memory technology is the right answer. Then, roughly in 2007, we'll see the introduction of a brand new core design kind of under the covers. Does that include a plan to offer quad-core processors by 2007? Hester: Yes. It seems that Intel has got a lot of different products coming right out of the gate in 2006, whereas--and this is the perception by some analysts--AMD will still be sitting on the same technology early next year. Hester: I give Intel great credit for creating a myth. (laughs) They've canceled a heck of a lot more projects than we've canceled. What I hear is the other guy is showing stuff that they're not going to ship for six to nine months and then comparing it to our stuff that's shipping today. What we showed in the analyst meeting was a road map that says, "Look guys, we have a track record of delivering improved performance every quarter." And so, if they're showing stuff that's six to nine months away, that's two to three of our steps away. And so, if they're having to show six-to-nine-months stuff against ours and saying it's kind of competitive to what we've got today, then by the time we get there, the shipping gap should be the same as the shipping gap today. So Intel, show me what it is that you're specifically going to deliver to the market that changes this. Another point that analysts point to is that Intel has an advantage in bringing 65-nanometer process technology to the semiconductor market faster. Hester: There are two pieces to that statement. The first part focuses on when Intel will ship its first 65-nanometer technology. The second piece of that statement questions when Intel's promise really yields in shipments and volume. AMD's philosophy is fundamentally different than Intel's. AMD tends to not buy the newest technology at the earliest possible date it's available. We tend to buy the technology a little bit later. The processes we put in place are focused around what we call automated precision manufacturing. What it allows us to do is tune the manufacturing process much tighter than when a general layer of silicon line is run. So if you look at the yield ramps in terms of the time that it takes from when you start producing the technology until it hits essentially sustainable manufacturing yields, that time for AMD is much faster than for someone else. So the question to me is not necessarily when you introduce the technology. I mean if you want to ship when you have very limited volumes, that's one discussion. The other discussion is when that technology is broadly shipping in the industry. From that perspective, I think we're in the position we need to be; we're fine. Besides, the last time I looked, people don't buy nanometers, they buy end-user performance. The man you're replacing as chief technology officer, Fred Weber, is called by many people the father of Opteron. What kinds of conversations did you two have before he left, and what advice did he give you? Hester: Fred and I have known each other for some time, so this was not a surprise that he was going to go do some other stuff in the venture capital world. But his thought was that I should continue to build on what he established. Did he put his arm around you and say something like, "All right kid, I worked hard on this. Don't screw it up?" Hester: Fred has done a great job. I won't screw it up. (laughs) What can you put in your new chips--Opteron or Athlon or even Turion--that's going to change the mind of Dell CEO Kevin Rollins? Hester: I have no idea. I think Kevin's decision on AMD is a business decision, not a technical decision. That's my personal opinion. Suppose Dell adopts AMD chips in volume amounts. Do you have a personal opinion about being able to supply this new wave of customers? There was some concern before Fab 36 in Dresden opened that you weren't going to be able to make enough. Hester: I think that concern is gone. We've talked to analysts about both our fab capacity and our flexible capacity to stay on top of the volumes that we expect.
2005-09-12 - Bechtolsheim's machine dreams  Over a long and distinguished career, Andy Bechtolsheim has earned a reputation as a top-notch engineer. Now that reputation will be put to the test. The task: Invent Sun Microsystems' next "hot box" out of the comparatively ordinary components of the x86 server market. That's no mean feat. The server market for machines built with x86 processors, such as Intel's Xeon or, in Sun's case, Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron, is enjoying rapid growth, but it's hard to make one x86 system stand out above the crowd. What's more, Sun is entering a market full of rivals that have years of design and sales experience already under their belt. The 49-year-old Sun co-founder nonetheless is confident Opteron will help Sun gain that edge. "If the world had not changed with Opteron, then Intel would still be building 32-bit (x86) chips, and it would have been too late for Sun to enter this market," Bechtolsheim said. In 1995, Bechtolsheim left Sun to start Granite Systems, which developed 1-gigabit-per-second Ethernet networking equipment. In 1996 Cisco Systems acquired the company for $220 million. Seven years later, Bechtolsheim founded Kealia to build special-purpose servers for handling video. Last year Sun bought the start-up with the idea of migrating the Kealia technology to mainstream servers. Sun hasn't been afraid to raise expectations for the Galaxy line of Opteron servers that now are on sale. "He's the most prolific and exciting and talented workstation and single-board computer designer on the planet," Chief Executive Scott McNealy said of Bechtolsheim when he announced the Kealia acquisition. "With this guy...designing Opteron servers, there ain't going to be nobody who has the class and breadth of computers we have." Bechtolsheim spoke with CNET News.com about the difficulties Sun has encountered during its embrace of x86 servers, as well as the future of the Galaxy line. Q: How is Sun different now than it was when you left in 1995? Bechtolsheim: Well, the funny thing is that one of the suggestions I had when I was leaving was maybe Sun should consider building an Intel-type product line just to make sure that we had that part of the market covered. But Sparc was doing really well back then, and nobody had any interest in that. Now I've ended up doing what I proposed the company should be doing 10 years ago. The point is that the company got a little too religious the last many years, prior to me coming back. It's a lot less religious these days. We obviously made a deal with Microsoft where we want to work with them to make life easier for customers to bridge the Solaris and the Microsoft operating environments. We're actually working with Microsoft on their services for management. And we now support the full range of operating systems, every version of Linux. What did you do at Sun in your first career there? What led you out of the company, and then what led you back? Bechtolsheim: Well, personally, I'm always driven by opportunities. We started Sun around the workstation opportunity (from) the work I did at Stanford--that's where the name came from, the Stanford University Network. Then Sun evolved into a server company, which was another great opportunity with the whole Sparc (processor) direction. In 1995, I saw an opportunity around changing the networking speed from 100 megabits to a gigabit. That got me very excited, so I left Sun to pursue that. I ended up being acquired by Cisco for a lot of money. I stayed there for the next seven years. The Cisco Catalyst 4000 and 4500 series was the product line that my group delivered to the market. It became the world's highest-volume modular chassis switch--I think they shipped over 50 million Ethernet ports. We have nothing against Intel. I got a little restless there a few years back, and I looked at some opportunities around media servers. This was when the Opteron architecture got announced by AMD and it was obvious to me that this architecture would make a significant difference in the market. Now you can't really start a start-up these days to be a server company. It's a little too late. The last two server companies to enter the market were Sun and Dell. It's really hard to enter this business on a grand scale. And so, as a start-up, I was looking at a video market as a vertical market segment opportunity. When Sun announced that it was going to do Opteron servers, we connected and said we had all this Opteron stuff under development, and would love to do more of that at Sun. We very quickly came up with the deal that brought me back to Sun. Combining the team I brought with me with the existing people at Sun was really the first time Sun made an internal design commitment to industry standard (x86) architecture. Since my return in April last year, we've been very busy working--not just on the systems we're announcing next week, but on a whole bunch of systems that are not yet ready for announcement. All are based around the Opteron architecture. Our original goal was to deliver a complete family of Opteron capability to the market. The first two members we're announcing are the 1U and 2U boxes (rack-mountable systems 1.75 inches and 3.5 inches thick), which is obviously the highest volume part of the market. In many ways the other systems are more interesting, but we can't talk about them today. Yeah, I am very curious about, in particular, the eight-processor server. Bechtolsheim: The company's public that it's working on systems up to eight-way. Obviously we are working on blade servers. But I just can't give you any more specific details on these systems. So what led you back to Sun is that you wanted to do something like a server start-up, but not just for the vertical markets? Bechtolsheim: AMD with Opteron is showing a lot of leadership doing the right things for the market and for customers. Building a new business at Sun around that was quite an interesting opportunity and really appealing to me personally. If the world had not changed with Opteron, then Intel would still be building 32-bit (x86) chips. It would have been too late for Sun to enter this market. You can't add any value to a market that doesn't change very much. People used to think with the Wintel duopoly--Windows and Intel--everything was quite stable and nothing would ever change. But now you've got AMD Opteron delivering the best server chip and you've got OpenSolaris and all the Linux stuff, so there's more competition in the industry-standard server space now than there has been in years. That makes life more interesting because it also means there's more innovation. How much of the Kealia work carried on directly to the Galaxy designs? Bechtolsheim: The more specific servers that were more media-targeted are actually not being announced next week. I know that they will soon come out. From a time-to-market standpoint, we focused on the 1U and 2U systems, which are the highest volume in the rack-mount server market. They will drive the revenue, quite frankly. From an economic or business impact, they will have the highest impact on Sun. When Sun started getting into the x86 market, McNealy said these designs are undistinguished---not exactly a dime a dozen, but he said, you just rolled over to Taiwan and put out some bids. Did you run into any resistance that these things, in fact, require a lot of engineering? Bechtolsheim: Well, quite frankly, one of the misunderstandings of the company at that time was that you could just fly to Taiwan and pick up these boxes. IBM, HP and Dell have been getting (their systems) made in Taiwan or China. But they all specify these things very tightly internally. You cannot buy the Dell box in Taiwan, you can only buy the Dell box from Dell. We had to change the mental model. Success in this market isn't free. We can't just rebadge or relabel third-party systems and deliver value to customers. Whose x86 market share are you eyeing? Bechtolsheim: As of last quarter, we actually are now the sixth largest x86 server in the world. We are hoping to move up to No. 4 here in the next calendar year. We are about to pass some people that you wouldn't consider mainstream, but that still are large vendors in their certain geographies. So next year, there are going to be four tier-one x86 server companies. How do you differentiate yourself in the world of x86 servers? What lets your hardware design stand out above those from IBM or Dell or Hewlett-Packard? Bechtolsheim: We worked with AMD to bring a higher performance version of the dual-core chip to market. So, this is actually a higher-power version, a 120-watt chip that they especially made for us. I guess they announced that they are going to also sell it to other people, but we're the only company that's going to actually ship this chip for a while into the market. This gives us one speed grade higher than what's available from anybody else. Now I've ended up doing what I proposed the company should be doing 10 years ago. Everybody wants lower power, but people also want higher performance. The cost of software in most cases is higher than the cost of the hardware, so you actually want the fastest throughput server to minimize the software investment and also the number of machines you have to manage. One disadvantage of dual-core so far was that the clock rate, quite frankly, was lower than the single core. When you put two cores on a chip, the power does go up if you want to keep the old clock rate. So with this higher power chip that we have in both the Galaxy boxes, and that we'll support in all our future boxes, we can bridge the performance gap between dual-core and single-core to the point where we now have truly the world's highest throughput 1U and 2U enterprise boxes. So you have a marginally faster processor... Bechtolsheim: Then we have power efficiency. Power efficiency is becoming probably the second most important criteria for most enterprises. They're running out of power and cooling in the data centers, and there's no justification to waste power on less efficient CPUs. This is not a stab against Intel here--they talked about power extensively at the Intel Developer Forum a few weeks ago--but they don't have a power-equivalent solution for probably another year. If power is a criteria for the customer, they really ought to consider Opteron, not Xeon. Now another thing we did is bundled in a complete ILO (integrated lights-out) management processor; we have a full keyboard-video-mouse and storage (KVMS) emulation, meaning you can do any management action over the Web without having to buy third-party solutions. That's almost a prerequisite in the enterprise world because people can't afford to have a system administrator in every remote branch office. You can completely reboot the server or put in the latest Microsoft security bug-fix. Galaxies are full enterprise-class chassis. You can hot-swap fans and you don't have to bring the system down, and the same with power. We have RAID (storage controller) on the motherboard. We used the 2-1/2 inch SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) drives, which are less power hungry and smaller than the older 3-1/2 inch disks. These are really next-generation chassis that we plan to keep for a long time, upgrading them to whatever the latest CPU clock rates are. There wasn't a chassis in the market that had the power, the cooling and the redundancy features that we needed to compete. I see those features as interesting, but not something that's an unbeatable lead over the competition. Bechtolsheim: No, the truth is these features exist in the Intel market today. What's interesting to us is that most of our competitors have not made that kind of commitment to AMD Opteron. Obviously Dell doesn't sell Opteron at all. IBM has one low-end Opteron system for technical computing, but they don't have enterprise-class Opteron systems. HP has made the broadest commitment, but they don't have a 1U enterprise Opteron server either, and 1U is the highest (volume) one in the market. What would it take to get you to bring Intel processors into your systems? Bechtolsheim: We have nothing against Intel. What we told Intel is if they have a better chip, we'll use it. It's just we haven't seen a better chip yet. They have to get absolute performance, cost/performance and power/performance. The real advance of Opteron was putting the memory controller on the CPU. That cut the latency to memory by half or more over Intel. You cannot hide the memory latency for real applications. They do have cache misses. They do go to memory. Right now, when Intel stops and needs something from memory, you sit there for hundreds and hundreds of clock cycles waiting for that memory access. It's not a good way of spending your CPU time. In in AMD's case it's just half the latency. I can't speculate in public here when Intel will have a memory controller on the chip, but... 2007. Bechtolsheim: Exactly. Now the other part is the HyperTransport interconnect that gives AMD a much more scalable story. We're not launching this product next week, but obviously one key attraction of Opteron was that it scales up to eight (processor) sockets, and Intel does not have that either. They are talking about more scalable things later on, but not in the near future. Does it require a whole new chipset to do an eight-socket server, or is that something you can just rely on HyperTransport to do? Bechtolsheim: HyperTransport interconnects the CPUs. There's no other chip investments we had to make to bring these systems to market. So the natural ability of Opteron goes up to 8-way, correct. Whereas in the Intel case, IBM spent $100 million in an effort to do a chipset to make the Xeon MP more scalable. Do you think Itanium is going to catch on widely? Bechtolsheim: They shipped about 5,500 systems last quarter. If you look at the IDC numbers, if you get beyond the Intel hype and look at the actual number of systems shipped, they're so small that we can't figure out why anybody is bothering with this. It's just amazing how few of the systems are shipping. What's happening is they're losing the software support. A few years ago, this was projected to be the next $20 billion market, and all the software vendors said, "If that's the case, then we will support it," but now nobody is making any money, so the software vendors are investing where they can make money. The industry is consolidating on (64-bit x86 servers).
2003-02-18 - BEA shoots out JRockit for Itanium 2   BEA Systems Tuesday will announce the availability of JRockit 8.0, a Java Virtual Machine suited for Intel's Itanium 2 microprocessor. The JRockit virtual machine allows applications written in Java to run on Intel's 64-bit processor without extensive modification, according to BEA executives. To take advantage of the processing muscle in Intel's line of Itanium chips, companies need to rewrite or update existing 32-bit applications for the Itanium. JRockit 8.0 is available for download from BEA or Intel this week. A version of JRockit for Red Hat Advanced Server will also be available this week and ready for Windows Server 2003 soon after its release in April. BEA will also include the JRockit Java Virtual Machine in WebLogic 8.1, which is due in April.
2003-02-13 - BEA releases WebLogic for Itanium  BEA Systems has released a version of its WebLogic software that runs on Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX version of Unix for Itanium processors, the companies said Wednesday. WebLogic Version 7 is available for version 1.6 of HP-UX 11i, the companies said. BEA's software, used to run tasks such as sophisticated e-commerce programs, is one of a host of packages that HP is trying to coax to its new server line. HP, which co-developed Intel's Itanium line, is moving all its server lines and operating systems to the new processor.
2001-07-23 - BEA partners with Intel on e-biz software  BEA Systems on Monday announced a partnership with Intel in a bid to increase its lead in the market for e-business software. The two companies will jointly fine-tune BEA's e-business software to run on servers that use Intel's new Itanium processor. The effort will focus on optimizing BEA software for both Linux and Windows on Itanium, an Intel representative said. Analysts say the collaboration is important for both companies. For BEA, having Intel support, market and sell its products gives the company a leg up on its competition in the lucrative market for application-server software, technology that handles e-business and other Web site transactions. In the $2.2 billion market in 2000, BEA ranked first with 18 percent of the market, followed by IBM with 15 percent and Sun Microsystems with 8 percent, according to a recent study by market researcher IDC. For Intel, the deal with BEA is a vote of confidence as it tries to crack the profitable high-end server market with its faster Itanium processors. Intel has done well in the less-profitable low-end server market, while rivals Sun, Hewlett-Packard and IBM have dominated the high-end market. Analysts say Intel's success in the high-end market depends on the number of software makers that write software that runs on its processors. BEA plans to release software that runs on Intel's Itanium chip this fall. So far, six server makers--Compaq Computer, Dell Computer, HP, NCR, Unisys and Groupe Bull--have said they will support BEA's application server running on Itanium. "This is the most important deal we've ever done," BEA Chief Executive Bill Coleman said in an interview. Although the Itanium-based server market is negligible now, "it could be the vast majority of the market in the next couple of years," Coleman added. Meta Group analyst Nick Gall said BEA's partnership with Intel is a smart move because it gives the company a new avenue for selling its software. BEA has sold a lot of its software running on Sun's servers, but Sun is also a BEA competitor in the application-server market. "Their good partnership is going to shift if Sun is serious about competing in the application-server market," Gall said. "Therefore, (BEA) has to look at other additional partners."
2005-03-01 - Barrett No end in sight for Moore's Law    SAN FRANCISCO--Moore's Law will boost chip abilities for many years to come, Intel CEO Craig Barrett predicted on Tuesday. The momentum will be kept up first through conventional manufacturing processes, then for many years after that by other technology, he said in a keynote speech at the Intel Developer Forum here. Barrett predicted that traditional chipmaking technology will permit features as small as 5 nanometers--about the width of 50 hydrogen atoms--to be used on processors. "We can see how to do this down into the 5-nanometer range," Barrett said. "Beyond that, lots of leakage currents and things like that get in the way. But every time we seem to get into a roadblock, the bright engineers...seem to circumvent that problem." The future of Intel and the computing industry in general depends in large measure on the ability to pack more circuitry components, called transistors, ever more tightly onto a slice of silicon. To do that, the size of chip features must be shrunk. Intel today is preparing to introduce processors with features measuring 65 nanometers, or billionths of a meter. Company engineers have forecast the feasibility of 5-nanometer manufacturing processes before. But the public declaration of the chipmaker's top executive carries more weight. "He was willing to extend the planning horizon to 5 nanometers," Peter Glaskowsky, an analyst at Envisioneering Association, said. The rest of the computing industry will be able to factor that into their plans, he added. "That means everybody gets to stay on the treadmill." Barrett showed photographs of transistor prototypes built with features measuring 65, 45, 32 and 22 nanometers. Glaskowsky said current expectations are for new processes with features of 15, 10, 7 and 5 nanometers. However, it is expected that the two-year pace of each new manufacturing process will slow, he said. Conventional chip manufacturing processes use a technology called complimentary metal oxide semiconductors, or CMOS. It's not clear what technology will replace that to create even tinier transistors, but Barrett mentioned three options: quantum dot, polymer layer and nanotube technology. "I don't think the world has decided what is the replacement yet," Barrett said. "Meanwhile, it's full blast ahead with the standard Moore's Law." Moore's Law is the 1965 projection by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the number of transistors on a chip will double about once every two years. "I've told Gordon I plan to help him celebrate the 50th anniversary of Moore's Law in 2015, and hopefully the 60th anniversary in 2025," Barrett said. Barrett plans to leave Intel's chief executive post in May, and will be replaced by President Paul Otellini. The company is in the midst of a reorganization and an effort to prevent a repeat of 2004, which was plagued by troubles. Intel chips are widely used in personal computers, but the company has had a hard time expanding into the cell phone market, Barrett acknowledged. He said progress will begin this year. "We haven't given up, and we are kind of doubling down in that space," he said. "We have done well in the PDA (personal digital assistant) space, but we have done less well in the cellular space, and we expect to see a number of design wins later this year." Another sore point for Intel has been the Itanium processor family, once aimed at the entire market for powerful networked computers called servers, but now designed just for high-end systems. The adoption of Itanium has been slower than Intel had hoped, but the company still has long-term plans for the chip. Intel will keep Itanium separate from the more widely used x86 chips such as Pentium and Xeon, Barrett said. "I don't see a great need to merge the two architectures," Barrett said. Itanium will compete increasingly with Power chips from IBM and Sparc chips from Sun Microsystems and Fujitsu, Barrett added. Hewlett-Packard, which codeveloped Itanium, is the chip's biggest supporter. Intel also is pushing into wireless communication technology. Barrett reiterated his company's support for WiMax, which can blanket a region as large as San Francisco with high-speed wireless networking abilities. "I think WiMax is going to be a disruptive technology that's going to change the way we think of mobile connectivity," including mobile phones, Barrett said. "Hopefully, it will get us out of the half-assed broadband capability we have today in the U.S." WiMax technology currently awaits adoption by network service providers. "Hopefully, toward the end of 2005 or 2006 you're going to see massive commercial rollouts of this capability," Barrett said.
2003-04-24 - Ballmer Right product right time   SAN FRANCISCO--Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on Thursday launched Windows Server 2003, a new version of the company's server operating system, which he described as "the right product" to help companies stretch their information technology (IT) budgets. The Redmond, Wash.-based company is positioning the new operating system as capable of pushing aside Unix servers and mainframes in the enterprise. That's been the software maker's long-term goal since the first release of a version of Windows for server systems nearly a decade ago. "This is an interesting time," Ballmer said, referring to the tough economic conditions and questions about whether now is the right time to launch Windows Server 2003. "I think this is absolutely the right time." Ballmer said he wanted to put the product's launch "in context with what's been going on in our industry." Technology budgets rose at the end of the 1990s because of Year 2000 technology bug worries and the dot-com boom. As spending decreased and the economy bottomed out, many technology managers had to put new projects on hold. Those trends "put our customers in the IT industry in a real tight jam. The challenge isn't just a challenge of cost reduction...(It's) to do more with less," said Ballmer. Ballmer said that Windows Server 2003 would "improve efficiency by 30 percent from where we've been, and (would deliver) even larger numbers" compared to other operating systems. That 30 percent cost reduction would come through server consolidation, improved management features and tighter security features. But analysts didn't share Ballmer's enthusiasm. Many companies are very reluctant to commit money to upgrade servers that may be working just fine as is. "In the (current) server environment, people do not upgrade," said Guernsey Research analyst Chris LeTocq. "You thought IT was conservative as a structure in the past? Right now, they're even more conservative." Ballmer unveils Windows Server 2003Steve Ballmer, CEO, Microsoft LeTocq speculated that, as with past Windows Server releases, most companies would wait until the first service pack--or collection of bug fixes--before upgrading to the new version. LeTocq expected Microsoft to release the first service pack in six months or so. Microsoft plans to spend as much as $250 million promoting Windows Server 2003 in print, television, Web and outdoor advertisements. During the software launch event, Microsoft introduced marketing taglines "Do more with less" and "Because we can." "The theme of the release is doing more with less," Ballmer said. But LeTocq noted that many technology managers see a greater possibility to meet that goal using Linux, the open-source operating system that has rapidly gained a sizable share of the server operating system market. Several of Microsoft's competitors, including IBM, have invested heavily in promoting Linux. "Linux is becoming a known quantity, and IT guys can see what's going on," LeTocq said. Worth the wait? Microsoft's CEO described the new product as the company's "highest-quality Windows Server product ever." For customers, Windows Server 2003 has been a long time coming. From conception to final code release, Windows Server 2003 has seen four different names and four release dates. In October 2000, Microsoft said the product would ship in the second half of 2001. But in April 2001, Microsoft pushed back delivery of the product, to early 2002. In March 2002, the software giant again delayed delivery until the second half of the year. And in November, the software titan delayed delivery for a third time, setting the April launch date. "We had (more than) 5,000 people working on Windows Server 2003 for a number of years," Ballmer said. About 100 customers participated in the development process, about 10,000 servers were running the software ahead of the launch, and there are a million beta copies in the market," Ballmer said. Microsoft also spent $200 million overhauling the security technology in Windows Server 2003. "We've gotten the message from our customers loud and clear" that security should be the top priority, Ballmer said. Ballmer spent much of his nearly 90-minute keynote address focusing on Windows Server 2003's enterprise capabilities. It marks a "breakthrough," he said, in terms of security, reliability and manageability, and what it means to software developers." The Kentucky Board of Education and JetBlue Airways were among the customers showcasing Windows Server 2003. Honeywell ACS described how it uses Windows SharePoint Services for collaboration. Microsoft is positioning the collaboration feature as a means of doing away with typical file-sharing services. Within Microsoft there are over 12,000 team servers. "Nobody does a file-share anymore," Ballmer said. LeTocq agreed that SharePoint is one of Windows Server 2003's "bright spots. As an end user, you can enable it in five minutes," he said. Ballmer also discussed the importance of Windows Server 2003 for running enterprise business software from Siebel Systems. He claimed that, in testing, the highest Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) benchmark results came with 30,000 concurrent Siebel users on a single Unisys Itanium 2 server running Windows Server 2003 64-bit edition. Ballmer joked about the ribbing Microsoft has taken in the past over Windows Server's capabilities compared to those of Unix systems and mainframes. Referring to previous efforts at making server operating systems, he said there are "no more toy operating systems" at Microsoft.
2002-08-20 - At Intel the chip with two brains  There's more than one way to build a multichip microprocessor, according to Intel. Learn more about chip changes in the works. Like researchers at other companies, scientists at the chipmaking giant are taking part in a dominant trend in microprocessor design: putting two chip cores, or "brains," into the same piece of silicon--an approach that, over the next decade, promises to improve performance and reduce power consumption. But Intel says its people are pushing the basic concept into new directions that will increase such benefits even further. In "core hopping," for example, a stream of calculations will jump from one microprocessor core to another. Localized heat generated by transistors during intense number-crunching can create "hot spots" that place a ceiling on performance, said Wilf Pinfold, technical director of microprocessor research at Intel labs. By rotating application processing, key transistors will stay cooler, heat will be dispersed over a greater geographic area and overall performance will climb. Other areas of research involve specialization, in which small chips-within-a-chip perform specific jobs such as encryption or compression, improving the way processing priorities are set. The changes are important in that, without a microprocessor overhaul, the industry's ability to continually make computing faster, cheaper and more powerful will begin to slow. "What we are really doing is moving beyond simply using the (manufacturing) process improvements and known architectural techniques," Pinfold said. "We're heading into a newer area of architectural design. We've run out of ideas and are now forging ahead with completely new ideas." Other companies are working on the dual-core theme as well. IBM last year released the Power 4, the first dual-core chip for servers, and it's planning to expand the concept with the Cell and Power 5 chips. Sun Microsystems is also working on a dual-core UltraSparc, according to sources. Meanwhile, vacant space on the memory controller inside Advanced Micro Devices' Hammer chip indicates the chip could be transformed into a dual-core processor, said Kevin Krewell, an analyst at Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. Intel's research direction, though, sheds light on the diverse evolutionary path for multicore chips, and highlights the importance of controlling power consumption in chips, which will contain 1 billion transistors by 2005. "What do you do with a 1 billion transistor budget? That is the bleeding edge of research," Krewell said. "When it comes to power, that is the No. 1 concern. People in servers don't want to go back to water cooling yet." An approach like core hopping, which Krewell likened to a game of "hot potato," could help alleviate the problem. The creative leap that lies ahead for microprocessor design could be termed Moore's Sunburn. Microprocessor performance has steadily increased over the past 30 years through the action of Moore's Law, which dictates that the number of transistors on a given chip doubles every two years. Increasing transistor budgets, though, are such that in the next decade or so microprocessors could begin exuding as much heat, for their size, as a nuclear reactor. To defuse the conflict, engineers are concentrating more on efficiency than on simply pumping up performance. In other words, they're trying to figuring out ways to better exploit the computing power of a chip and the growing transistor budget, rather than gunning the clock speed, juicing the voltage or throwing even more transistors into a device to make it more powerful. "You can very efficiently use the expensive resources on a processor," Pinfold said. "There has been a progressive change in our thinking. In the early '90s we were still in the mode of 'performance is everything.' Now we start by defining a power envelope." Two basic approaches In general, there are two basic approaches to building multicore processors. Symmetric multiprocessing chips, such as IBM's Power 4 and presumably chips with core hopping, essentially squeeze two equal processors into a single piece of silicon, so that the chip provides the same computing power as a dual-processor server. The approach saves on computing real estate and can increase efficiency because the chip cores can share cache memory or buses. In asymmetric multiprocessing, the two internal chip cores differ from each other and perform specific functions, offloading work from the central processor. Additionally, you could get "little co-processors that do various tasks now handled by software," said Krewell, jobs such as TCP/IP processing or encryption. Similarly, chip designers could build high-intensity regions into the chip. Intense, high-priority number-crunching calculations could be directed toward certain transistors being supplied with greater amounts of power, Pinfold said. Less significant tasks, meanwhile, could be shunted off to other regions. The ultimate design and techniques used will depend on the whether the chip will go into mobile devices, servers or desktops. Research is being conducted in the company's labs in the United States, but also in Israel and Barcelona, Spain, owing to the diverse nature of the work. "The microprocessor of the future will be much more appropriate to its use," Pinfold said. "We will go to where we can find the best architects." The processor changes will take place in tandem with increased thread-level parallelism. Under thread-level parallelism, software instructions get separated into individual streams. Once broken down, the streams of an application can be processed in parallel, rather than sequentially, thereby saving time. Cache misses--when a processor doesn't have the required data in its nearby cache of memory--can hinder computer performance because the processor has to spend cycles digging the data out of main memory. Helper threads could anticipate potential cache misses and retrieve the data before the required calculation, Pinfold said. Current benchmarks show substantial performance benefits through application threading. Hyperthreading, which takes advantage of threaded applications, was introduced to Intel's Xeon line earlier this year and will soon come to the Pentium line, sources have said. The increased emphasis on application threading comes at a crucial time. For the past decade or so, designers have squeezed performance out of instruction-level parallelism, which involves juggling the processor's instructions for greater efficiency. But the ceiling is in sight. "We've pretty much mined that vein as far as performance is concerned," Pinfold said. Although all of the ideas show promise, it's difficult to predict how they will be embodied in commercial products. Some of these chips will need extraordinary amounts of cache to work properly, which will force designers to balance the performance-power equation, said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64. Some processors, such as the Itanium chip, already take advantage of application threading, so they don't need to adapt multicore ideas right away. Still, the mathematics make multicore chips inevitable in many markets. "Multicore is a very efficient way to use up transistors and increase performance," Brookwood said.

2004-08-03 - Army supercomputing drafts Intel AMD   In one race to sell 64-bit x86 chips to high-performance computing customers, Intel and rival Advanced Micro Devices both won. The U.S. Army Research Laboratory has elected to buy an IBM supercomputer with 2,304 AMD Opteron processors, the companies plan to announce Tuesday at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo. The news comes a few months after Linux Networx announced that the same lab is buying a machine with 2,132 of Intel's new "Nocona" model Xeon processors. The Nocona chips, introduced in numerous servers Monday, are Intel's first server chips to include the 64-bit extensions that AMD pioneered with its Opteron chips. The 64-bit abilities make it easier to handle more than 4GB of memory. The Army will use the systems at its Major Shared Resource Center, one of four sites used for Department of Defense supercomputing needs such as basic science, weapons design and chemical-reactions research. The IBM system, made of dual-processor machines running SuSE Linux from Novell, are connected with high-speed networking gear from Myricom into a supercomputing cluster. It's expected to have computational capacity of 10 trillion calculations per second, or 10 teraflops, a level reached by only a few computers today. Meanwhile, Silicon Graphics Inc., which is emphasizing Intel's other 64-bit chip family, Itanium, announced another cluster customer. The University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute purchased a system with eight of SGI's Altix 350 computers, each with eight Itanium 2 processors and the Linux operating system. The cluster is connected with an InfiniBand switch from Voltaire.
2005-02-09 - Are sharks circling HP While the departure of Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina is unlikely to immediately alter the computer hardware market, it will be used as ammunition by Dell and others in an attempt to win HP customers, analysts say. Although HP plans to continue selling its main products and will keep its PC business in-house at least for now, analysts say competitors ranging from Dell and IBM to specialists such as Sun Microsystems and lesser PC players such as Gateway will attempt to wrestle away its corporate accounts, as well as large government and education customers. HP's changes "could present the opportunity for its competitors to have a good year," said Chad McDonald, senior manager for product planning at Gateway. Bob Wayman, HP's CFO and interim CEO, said the company doesn't intend to alter its fundamental structure, suggesting that radical measures such as spinning off HP's PC business--a measure that, like IBM's plan to sell its PC business to Lenovo Group, would change the face of the PC market--won't come in the short term, while it searches for a new chief executive. HP weathered the storm of uncertainty relatively well during its acquisition of Compaq Computer in May 2002. It maintained relationships it inherited with large companies such as Walt Disney. But it has been under tremendous pressure from the likes of Dell, whose shipments outgrew HP's during the fourth quarter--normally HP's strongest time of year--ranking Dell as the top PC maker. Stirring up the pot "It'd be easy for Dell to characterize HP as being in disarray, whether or not it's actually true," said Roger Kay, an analyst at IDC. "Any time there's a disturbance in a company, competitors can point to instability. They can stir up the pot, and they do." For its part, "Dell continues to stir up the pot with IBM's customers--it'll use anything it can to pry away customers from competitors," Kay said. IBM's plans to sell its PC business to Lenovo has been under scrutiny from the U.S. government. Between IBM's shifts and HP's leadership changes, analysts say some customers might perceive an increasingly tumultuous PC market and turn to Dell, which has been steadily growing. Others could benefit as well. Gateway, which acquired eMachines last year and subsequently reorganized by trimming its work force and reforming its product lines, will also seek an edge. The company, which plans to make a push in selling business notebooks during 2005, continues to be strong in government and education, its executives say. While HP will face new battles on the PC front, Sun Microsystems and IBM could move in on it with big iron as well. HP and Compaq argued that one technology in particular would carry the combined company to greater heights: Intel's Itanium processor for high-end server computers. Both companies believed that Intel's Itanium would sweep the market for servers and become as widely used as x86 chips such as the Pentium--and that the new HP would lead the market. But that Itanium ubiquity failed to materialize because of delays, unspectacular initial performance and difficulties adapting software to the processor. And now HP's three server competitors have headed in the opposite direction. IBM now aggressively promotes its own Power processor family, Sun Microsystems is reinvigorating its Sparc line and embracing x86, and Dell continues its gains with the much more widely used Xeon processors from Intel. While HP has consolidated many of its server lines on Itanium, it's had troubles, too. In December, it scrapped a plan to bring key elements of Compaq's version of Unix to the surviving HP-UX. And the company sells servers with Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron processor, which undermined one Itanium advantage by bringing 64-bit memory addressing to the x86 realm. Still, analysts expressed some optimism for Hewlett-Packard on Tuesday. HP "might be at the point where the company looks like it's going to take a new direction, and maybe it'll get its act together," said Chris Foster, an analyst at Technology Business Research. "For some of the customers that have hung around, that did business with the old HP, maybe there's some relief" that the company might return to its roots in engineering. For customers, "I would definitely think there's optimism at this point," Foster said. "I don't think there's anyone terribly upset today." Management changes are also unlikely to have a big impact on HP's consumer businesses. "At this point, I don't think anything is going to translate down to the sales floor," said Steve Baker, an analyst at The NPD Group. "I don't think there's any uncertainty that there isn't going to be a line of PCs coming from (HP)." For its part, HP did share some of its plans for the future. Wayman said during a conference call for press and analysts that the company intends to expand in those areas where it is strong, notably in imaging and printing. At the same time, it will seek to improve the profitability of its other businesses, including its server and storage business, and its professional-services consulting arm. "In our PC business, we have made great progress in a number of arenas. Profitability has gone from a substantial loss position to a reasonable level of profitability," Wayman said. Meanwhile, "in our enterprise storage and server business, this is where we had significant disappointment last year, particularly in the third quarter. We fully acknowledged and described the execution problems. We have those particular problems behind us, but we now have to develop a steady and consistent track record." CNET News.com's Stephen Shankland contributed to this report.
1999-10-06 - Analysts expect deep loss from AMD AMD has grand long-term plans for extending its chip architecture, but more immediate obstacles have left the company with gloomy financial predictions. This afternoon, the Intel rival is expected to report a loss of 97 cents per share for the most recent quarter, according to financial analysts surveyed by First Call. That loss would be considerably greater than the 1 cent per share profit from the same quarter a year ago, but not as deep as the $1.10 loss posted last quarter. But AMD has the potential for greatness, analysts say. Yesterday, AMD unveiled plans to take on Intel's upcoming 64-bit Itanium chip by extending the current "x86" chip architecture instead of following Intel's plan of starting afresh. Though analysts are cautious about AMD's ability to pull off such a grand plan, several at this week's Microprocessor Forum noted that AMD could clean up if Intel's Itanium plan stumbles. The Itanium, formerly code-named Merced, is due in mid-2000 and is the first in Intel's family of high-end "IA-64" chips. AMD's current high-performance Athlon chip, which has beat out current Pentiums from Intel, could fill current demand, while its new "x86-64" chips in 2001 could step in if Itanium flops. Another change that could help AMD is a possible deal with Motorola in which AMD could use its new Dresden, Germany, chip factory to build Motorola G4 chips. That deal would follow one AMD announced more than a year ago under which Motorola builds AMD's Athlon chips, formerly called K7s. Using AMD facilities also would help out Motorola, which has been unable to meet Apple's demand for new G4 chips. Making Motorola chips makes sense: Through a technology-swapping deal, the two companies expect to have identical chipmaking technology. Merrill Lynch analyst Joe Osha said that regardless of what happens with Motorola, AMD needs to find a use for the capacity of the Dresden facility. AMD is scaling back its K6 production, but the replacement Athlon chips aren't being made in the same quantities. "The question is: How are they going to meet their capital utilization needs with K6 ramping down?" Osha said. Osha expects that AMD's chip shipments will stay level at about 5 million for the most recent quarter. BancBoston Robertson Stephens analyst Dan Niles predicted that this quarter, AMD will report sales of about 200,000 Athlon chips. Next quarter, he and Osha both estimate that number will rise to about one million. However, Osha believes that only tens of thousands of those will run at the most recently announced 700-MHz speed, Osha estimated. The Athlon is an important part of AMD's financial plans, since it's aimed at high-end computers and therefore has higher profit margins than the lower-end K6 chips. Athlons running at 750 MHz are expected in the first quarter of 2000, Niles said, and AMD chips with faster copper technology should arrive by the end of 2000. Intel isn't standing still, though. It's expected to counter with its new "Coppermine" Pentium III chips on October 25, chips that will use Intel's new 0.18-micron manufacturing technology and come with more higher-speed memory. Intel lost market share in the low end of the market to AMD and other competitors in 1998, said Microdesign Resources analyst Keith Diefendorff. But Intel was unwilling to lose market share. It slashed prices on its low-end Celeron chips and reversed the market share decline.
2006-02-14 - Analyst firm offers rosy view of Itanium   The Itanium processor has had a rocky debut in the more than 11 years since Intel and Hewlett-Packard first announced the chip alliance, but a major analyst firm says things are looking up. Itanium market awareness is high, not only among the HP server customers who would be expected to know of the processor but also among others, according to a February report from IDC based on a survey of 501 computer system managers at U.S. companies with at least 200 employees. "Given the colorful history of product development and the slower-than-expected ramp of Itanium server sales, we had frankly expected that awareness of the platform would be spotty and that customer consideration and intent of purchase would be very low. In fact, we found just the opposite," IDC said. "The current market perceptions of Itanium-based servers are quite positive." The favorable assessment is a spot of good news for a chip family that has been plagued by troubles, including the 2005 delay of its newest model, code-named Montecito. The chip family was expected to sweep the computing landscape, but instead Itanium's difficulties have illustrated what can go wrong when introducing a brand-new design. As Itanium expectations were pared back over the years, in part because of the success of x86 chips such as Intel's Xeon, estimates for customer spending on servers using the high-end chip fell accordingly. Despite the woes, IDC sees a relatively rosy future of growth. Customer spending of about $2.4 billion on Itanium servers in 2005 should increase to $6.6 billion in 2009, according to the report. Over the next five years, nine Itanium allies are sinking $10 billion into work to develop Itanium products and lure software companies to support the chip. The positive perception of the chip for server tasks is a good foundation for the work, IDC said. Today, HP holds the lion's share of the Itanium server market--nearly 70 percent--but that should even out with the Itanium Solutions Alliance work, IDC predicted. However, there's still work to be done in Itanium awareness. HP is using Itanium to gradually replace its in-house chip, PA-RISC, the last model of which HP introduced in 2005. But about 13 percent of HP-UX customers still aren't aware of Itanium, IDC found, and 29 percent weren't aware that PA-RISC was being phased out. Among other results of the survey: About 24 percent of the survey respondents have installed an Itanium system--30 percent among HP customers and 13 percent among non-HP customers. Attracting a broad customer base, in particular customers outside HP, is critical to ensuring broad support by software companies. About a third of respondents expect to purchase an Itanium server in the next 12 to 18 months. Among PA-RISC server customers, 65 percent plan to move their systems to Itanium systems, most likely within two to three years. Among the PA-RISC customers not planning to adopt Itanium, systems with Intel's Xeon processor are the most likely alternative, expected to be used in 38 percent of cases. Sun Microsystems' Sparc and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron are tied in next place with 25 percent each. IBM's Power processor family is the expected alternative in 11 percent of cases.
2008-07-18 - AMD's Ruiz steps off the roller coaster    Hector Ruiz accomplished many important things during his tenure as the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, but no executive can escape the bottom line. AMD's CEO Hector Ruiz is stepping down from his CEO spot; he'll remain the chairman of the company. AMD In just more than six years with Ruiz as the leader of AMD, the chip company has lost a staggering $6.3 billion according to generally accepted accounting principles. He announced plans to step down Thursday as part of what the company is calling a planned succession to new CEO Dirk Meyer, even though Ruiz was under the impression as recently as December 2007 that he would be around this entire year. "A lot has changed at AMD since then," an AMD representative wrote in response to e-mailed questions about Ruiz's expectations last year. One thing that hasn't changed since then is the company's continued pattern of losses. But AMD has laid off thousands of workers and revamped its executive circle, which has strengthened the team around Meyer to the point where the board of directors feels the timing is now right for the succession, according to the representative. Despite all the setbacks, it's still possible to argue that Ruiz leaves AMD a better place than it was before he took over. Sure, investors might have preferred to lose a little bit less than $6 billion in six years, but AMD is a brand that corporate executives know just as well as hard-core gamers, AMD's main audience prior to 2002. All four major server vendors (Hewlett-Packard, Dell, IBM, and Sun Microsystems) have a relationship with AMD. Just about every major PC vendor in the world has a product based on AMD's chips, with the notable exception of Apple. Corporate purchasing departments don't shake their heads in confusion at seeing AMD's name on a purchase order, and consumers are quite used to seeing AMD-based systems on the store shelves at Best Buy and other stores alongside Intel systems. In short, Ruiz made AMD relevant to a much wider segment of the computer buying population than it was before he became the company's CEO, and for sticking to his guns with AMD's bet-the-farm strategy for its Opteron chip. For that, he deserves credit. But the events that led to his demise are equally easy to chronicle. Ruiz with Dell's Michael Dell in 2006, just after the companies signed their historic agreement to partner on servers. Ina Fried/CNET News AMD succumbed to the classic innovator's dilemma: once it was clear Opteron was a hit, especially in dual-core format, AMD failed to come up with a worthy successor. It insisted on an integrated quad-core design for its third-generation Opteron processor, claiming that its customers were eager for such a design. But the project suffered from countless delays, and AMD allowed Intel to have the quad-core segment of the server market all to itself for more than a year, destroying the hard-earned pricing value that AMD had attached to Opteron for several years. Once it was also clear that Intel had regained its footing after botching the Itanium strategy and the switch to dual-core processors, AMD panicked and spent $5.4 billion it didn't have on ATI Technologies in order to find its next big thing in graphics technology. Ruiz was right, in a sense: graphics technology is going to be an ever-increasing part of a PC's arsenal and will probably one day end up getting integrated into the main processor like so many other discrete components from the past. Intel and Nvidia know this, and are spending tons of time and money improving the performance of their graphics products and finding new ways to unlock that performance. But with Thursday's results, AMD has now written off $2.5 billion of goodwill related to that ATI purchase, basically admitting that it can't attach that $2.5 billion to anything of value related to the acquisition. That's an awful lot of money, and it has to come from somewhere, forcing AMD to raise capital from outside investors to keep the lights on. Ruiz introduces AMD's Barcelona processor in September 2007. Already very late, Barcelona wouldn't ship for another six months due to a separate problem. Tom Krazit/CNET News Ruiz's greatest legacy to the processor industry might still be off in the future. His decision to file an antitrust lawsuit against Intel in 2005--and work a short rant about illegal monopolies into just about every speech since--has the larger chip company on the run around the world as governments take a closer look at Intel's business practices during the past decade. Any trial resulting from that case in the U.S. still appears to be years away, however. Leaders are judged on many things after their moment in the sun passes. Ruiz brought some stability to AMD--at least in the public eye--after decades of swashbucklin' quote-makin' Jerry Sanders. His personal story, rising from a poor town on the Texas/Mexico border to lead a Fortune 500 company, is inspirational both on its merits alone and on Ruiz's stubborn reluctance to play up his ability to overcome adversity as if he was filming a segment for Dateline. But his tenure was chaotic, a roller coaster ride up and down the stock market charts that saw AMD arrive on the world stage and fall just as quickly off to the side. Running the No. 2 company in an expensive, fast-moving industry dominated by an American institution is not an easy job, and Dirk Meyer will have his hands full during the next several years. Ruiz will remain at AMD as chairman, but he's leaving a day-to-day role at the company at a time when it is trying to get back to basics, to focus on execution and discipline rather than trying to take down giants. So perhaps it's fitting to remember the words of football legend Bill Parcells when assessing Ruiz's legacy: "You are what your record says you are."
2002-11-20 - AMD's Opteron to power skinny server   Boston-based Angstrom Microsystems said it will sell a 1.75-inch-thick server with dual 64-bit Opteron processors when the Advanced Micro Devices chip is released in the first half of 2003. Some customers will be able to use beta, or test, versions of the server with prototype processors in order to develop Opteron software, Angstrom said. The Titan64 server will run both Linux and Windows operating systems, Angstrom said. One advantage of 64-bit processors, such as Opteron and Intel's Itanium, is the larger amounts of memory support they provide, and the Titan64 will accommodate as much as 16GB of RAM. The server uses a motherboard from Newisys.
2003-04-08 - AMD's Opteron aspirations  Dirk Meyer helped rescue Advanced Micro Devices from a tight spot once before. Now the company is hoping he can do the trick again. Meyer, who is senior vice president of AMD's Computation Products Group, joined the company in 1996 to become director of engineering for the K-7. The K-7 ultimately became the Athlon, the microprocessor that pulled the company out of a financial tailspin and earned industrywide respect for AMD's design capabilities. AMD again finds itself facing a familiar scenario. The company is a couple of weeks away from introducing a new chip for servers--this time it's the Opteron, a product that analysts and computer executives believe could establish the microprocessor maker as a major player in services. But at the same time, AMD is swimming in red ink, and the company's comeback depends on the success of the new microprocessor. Meyer, who was the co-architect of the Alpha 21064 and 21264 microprocessors at Digital and worked at Intel, spoke with CNET News.com about lessons learned from the past, the upcoming chip and AMD's ongoing competition with Intel. Q: Opteron comes out in a few weeks. What's left? A: We have a launch event on April 22. That's about it. There are essentially no issues on the manufacturing front. There seems to be two general technological thrusts behind Opteron. The chip can run 32- and 64-bit software, but it also reduces memory latency. It seems like a lot of the bang for the buck, at least initially, will come in reduced latency. If you look at the product features of Opteron and compare it with what's in the market today, there are generally three new features. One is the 64-bit extension to x86. No. 2 is the integration of the memory controller onto the microprocessor silicon, which of course is a good thing for memory latency, and hence a very good thing for performance. Memory latency is a barrier to better system performance. The third element is the creation of Hypertransport, which in particular is relevant in servers. Hypertransport essentially allows you to build systems that scale very well. As you add processors to the system, you also pick up memory capacity and memory bandwidth. What people want to know is, Can AMD make the chip? and Can AMD deliver the performance as measured by 32-bit applications? How will the chip roll out? Will smaller manufacturers and white-box guys sell Opteron servers first? Yeah. The launch event is going to be a big event and when you see the level of participation at the event you will be impressed, but it is just another step along a road toward Opterons everywhere. What are some of the factors that could tip acceptance for Opteron? Will it be good benchmark tests? Will it take a few major Fortune 500 types to toggle over? If you stand back, what we are really talking about is the creation or formulation of an Opteron ecosystem and there are a whole bunch of players and agents that are going to need to be part of it. Ultimately, Fortune 500 customers are going to be one contingent. Software developers with 64-bit apps are going to be another. The good news is that the economic value equation is real obvious. What people want to know is if AMD can make the chip and if AMD can deliver the performance as measured by 32-bit applications, because that is what is available today. When the answer is yes to that, the next question is, What about the 64-bit ecosystem? How far down the road is that? The real analogy is a snowball rolling down a hill. I can't point to any great event that makes a snowball go from a snowflake to an avalanche, but as time goes by the snowball gets bigger and bigger and rolls faster and faster. Is the release of 64-bit software going to be more of a 2004 event or a late 2003 sort of thing? As you know, we've been working with the Linux community for years now. We've got 64-bit kernels running. We've got a 64-bit development environment going. That will essentially be available at launch. What I can't speak to yet is what Red Hat's plans are versus what a SuSE is doing. In general, speaking of Linux, over the course of 2003, you're going to see an increased level of support, and certainly by the end of 2003, all the pieces will be there. How about Microsoft? As you know, last April we signed this collaboration agreement. And as every day goes by, I can tell you--and this sounds corny--but I can tell you that I have been happy with Microsoft on this front. Is Intel working on a 32/64-bit chip? Every time the topic comes up, they stand behind Itanium. To me, it is not a matter of if, but when. I just think the direction is so clear, and what the customers want is so clear, that given the existence of competition in the marketplace, Intel will ultimately have no choice but to respond. If we didn't exist, I think Intel would be in a position to drive Itanium down everyone's throat. But we do exist, and we are going to offer an alternative and even a virtual monopolist like Intel is going to respond at some point. Itanium in some ways could be called a historical anomaly. The idea was conceived when Intel was barely in the server arena. You guys weren't looking at the server area. Then Itanium got delayed and delayed. Then Xeon came along. I was back at Digital when Intel came out with their Itanium plans. It was back in the early '90s. Since then a couple of things have changed. One is that they've got more meaningful competition in the marketplace in the form of us. No.2, the economics that drive the server business have changed in the last ten years. Intel has been incredibly successful in driving PC economics into the server space and driving x86 into the server space and, in essence, created by themselves a demand for x86-64 in the server market. We are going to offer an alternative, and even a virtual monopolist like Intel is going to respond at some point. Speaking of Digital Equipment, it was an interesting company. A lot of ideas for chip design--multithreading, integrating the memory controller--seem to have come out of there. What was going on? Can you trace the heritage of Opteron back to the company? I don't want to trace specific products from AMD back to Digital, but Digital just had an unbelievably talented engineering team in all sorts of areas. Just look around the industry and look at the people that came from Digital and what they've done. For example, Intel StrongArm was created by a bunch of guys I worked with on Alpha. It was an incredible environment. Didn't Hypertransport originally emerge out of Alpha? I think what you are thinking of is that the first Athlon incorporated the EV6 front side bus. Hypertransport was largely an AMD invention. I thought it came from an Alpha group. Alpha Processors was a wholly owned subsidiary of Samsung. API was cast with creating chipsets and hardware in an attempt to make the Alpha market bigger than Digital. As a result of them building chipsets using the EV6 bus and us being on the EV6 bus at the time, we had reasons to visit API. We were pretty far down the road on Hypertransport, but we were culturally quite compatible. Some of those engineers contributed materially to the Hypertransport spec. Samsung ultimately closed down API and we hired all of the engineers. Our Boston design center is made up of API folks. But how do you prevent what happened to Digital from happening to AMD? They had a lot of talent and great ideas, but they could never get past 4 percent to 5 percent market share. Digital was in a terrible trap. They grew up in the context of the old vertically integrated computer companies with an economic model set up around selling expensive minicomputers with high margins to a captive customer base. As we all know, the computer industry got transformed from being an industry made up of vertically integrated companies to a horizontally integrated industry. Digital could never break out of that trap. And despite the fact that Alpha was a wonderful technology, they were never successful at making Alpha any bigger than Digital's market. This led to the demise of the business model. Interestingly, if you look at Sun, they were much more successful at getting Sparc big enough to base a business on. But I think that many people now question Sun's business model. On another subject, the desktop version of the chip, Athlon 64, won't come out now until September. Why the delay? It was a bunch of things. We wanted to focus our energies on Opteron because that is an opportunity for us to bust into a new market. The Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. other dimension is that the capability of Barton (a new version of the Athlon chip that came out in February) exceeded, a little bit, our expectations. We're able to sell Barton at the top of the desktop marketplace. Given that we can participate at all of the price points with Barton, there is not a burning need in the short term to come out with Athlon 64. So it made good business sense to focus our resources on Opteron. Conceptually, Athlon 64 will come out at the top of the market and waterfall down, kind of at the rate our processors normally fall down. You can go back and look at our road maps and draw Athlon 64 along the same chart. But it will now come out the same time as Prescott, Intel's next major chip. For years, though, Hector (Ruiz, CEO of AMD) and Jerry Sanders (AMD's founder) have talked about AMD's die-size advantage and how a smaller chip leads to lower costs. Prescott will be a 90-nanometer chip. Athlon 64 comes out on 130 nanometers. As a result, does the die-size advantage disappear? It is probably kind of misleading to compare a 130 to a 90. I guess what I will say is this: At like technologies, 130 to 130, and 90 to 90, we have a die-size advantage. I expect that to be true going forward. It has also typically been the case that Intel introduces a new technology--be it 180 or 130 or 90--a little bit ahead of us. But we follow very quickly and ultimately transition our factory much more quickly. We transitioned from 180 to 130 over the course of two quarters. It is a difficult question to answer in the middle of a technology transition. So there might be a little more parity in terms of size between the two chips at the beginning, but we're also talking about small volumes? Right. Hector also recently talked about how AMD engineers and developers are moving to upstate New York to work at IBM on developing future microprocessor technology? How much of the engineering staff is up at IBM right now? Our Semiconductor Development Center in Sunnyvale (Calif.) used to house both memory that is flash, and logic technology development. SDC is transitioning this quarter to be devoted to flash. Meanwhile, our logic technology development is going to be done jointly with IBM, and we will have a number of AMD engineers working in East Fishkill (N.Y.). Ultimately, that technology will be deployed in our factories. So it will be the logic development guys, not the processor designers, who are going to New York? It is purely manufacturing process development.
2002-04-25 - AMD's Hammer chips get Microsoft nod   AMD confirmed Wednesday that it will collaborate with Microsoft to tune Windows to run on its upcoming family of Hammer chips. As reported earlier, Microsoft's decision is a strong endorsement for AMD. Although its chips are widely used in the consumer market, the company remains a marginal player in the corporate world. With Linux developers and now Microsoft formally committing to gear their operating systems for the company's chips, AMD can begin to convince server manufacturers and IT managers to move away from a diet based strictly on Intel and RISC (reduced instruction set computing) technology. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based processor maker also unveiled the official names for Hammer chips. The desktop versions of the chip, currently code-named Clawhammer and slated for release at the end of the year, will be sold under the Athlon name. The multiprocessor versions of the chip for servers, code name Sledgehammer and due in the first half of 2003, will be sold under the name Opteron. The name derives from the Latin "optimus," which suggests best, vital, potent and mighty, according to AMD. Hammer chips differ from existing chips in that they can read 32-bit code, the basis for nearly all software for PCs today, and 64-bit code, used by high-end servers. Among their other advantages, 64-bit computers can manage more than 4GB of memory, the physical limit for 32-bit machines. The chip's ambidextrous nature brings a number of advantages, according to AMD. Among the advantages, AMD can use the same basic chip design to span a wide variety of computers, according to Dirk Meyer, group vice president of AMD's computational products group. In addition, the same chip core can be used in everything from notebooks to multiprocessor servers, allowing for the same software to work on all these machines. Many, like Microsoft, will tune their software to fully take advantage of the so-called 64-bit mode, but it's not necessary. Without taking a performance hit, 32-bit applications will run on computers running Hammer as a 32-bit chip as well as those running Hammer in 64-bit mode. "Hammer will allow us to play across a wide variety of applications," Meyer said. By contrast, Intel has two chip architectures: the 32-bit Pentium family for everything from notebooks to small servers, and the 64-bit Itanium for large servers based around a completely different architecture. Software for the Pentium family runs, but not well, on Itanium, according to analysts; and Itanium software doesn't run on Pentiums. To cure this discrepancy, sources say, Intel is working on a chip called Yamhill that will perform in a similar manner as Hammer. While Hammer's flexibility is an advantage, AMD still faces an uphill battle in getting mass acceptance in the corporate market. Both Microsoft and AMD were vague on the details of the versions of Windows optimized for Hammer. Pricing and tentative release schedules were not revealed. It is also unclear whether Microsoft will include the Hammer extensions into all versions of Windows or a specialized one. The companies, though, were emphatic that Microsoft engineers would be performing the lion's share of the work. Although Microsoft's endorsement is significant, AMD will still have to convince hardware manufacturers, software developers and corporate customers to invest time and energy into using Hammer as a 64-bit chip. "Even if they get the support of Microsoft, will they be able to line up suppliers of enterprise servers to carry Hammer?" asked Brookwood. "IBM, HP, Compaq (Computer), Unisys, Fujitsu, Sun (Microsystems)--it's a short list." Hammer will likely find much quicker acceptance in the desktop arena, but many won't use it as a 64-bit chip for a year or more, according to analysts and AMD executives. Most desktop applications are written for 32-bit chips, and there is little demand for desktops with 4GB of memory. "It is going to be a workstation and server story for a while," IDC analyst Roger Kay said.
2001-11-09 - AMD's future Notebooks servers Hammer  AMD spent most of 2001 increasing its market share in desktops; next year it will concentrate on notebooks and servers--and gear up for the 2003 push on Hammer, its next-generation chip. "2002 will largely be defined by our success in the mobile and server space, and holding ground in the desktop space," CEO Jerry Sanders said at the company's annual analyst meeting Thursday, where AMD also revealed its product plans for the coming year. "Instead of a (Microsoft-Intel) duopoly, we are going to have a holy trinity," he said. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based chipmaker's strategy will focus on lowering manufacturing costs and touting its chips through the mass of second-tier manufacturers and dealers, the so-called white-box segment of the market that is showing growing resilience, especially overseas. "The white box market seems to be doing relatively better than some of the OEMs (original equipment manufacturers)," said Sanders, adding that in servers, the company is targeting "all white-box guys." Intel also touted the importance of white-box sales, especially internationally, in its analysts' conference call in October. As for costs, AMD said it would reduce overhead by trimming back operations. Expenses associated with moving to 300-millimeter wafers, for instance, will be cut because the company won't move to the standard until 2005, and then will do so by sharing the cost of a new fabrication facility with a partner. In addition, the company said it would aim to undercut Intel by producing chips that are significantly smaller. AMD will kick off 2002 with the release of "Thoroughbred," a version of the Athlon XP chip made on the more advanced 130-nanometer manufacturing process. The chip will cover 80 square millimeters in area, or 65 percent of the space of the "Northwood" Pentium 4 coming from Intel in early January. That chip measures 116 square millimeters, according to AMD estimates. Both companies will shrink their chips again in 2003 by adopting the 90-nanometer manufacturing process, but AMD will still maintain an advantage, company executives claim. (The nanometer measurements refer to the average size of features on the chip.) "We believe we have a 10 percent to 20 percent advantage on cost," said Hector Ruiz, president of AMD. Ambitious plans Along with keeping its chips small, AMD has other ambitious plans. In the fourth quarter, it will come out with a 1.3GHz Athlon and a 1.2GHz Duron for notebooks. The first quarter will mark the appearance of the first Athlon and Duron notebook chips adopting the so-called model-number brand scheme, which downplays megahertz. In the first quarter, an 1800 Athlon for notebooks will come out, which will likely run at 1.5GHz, as will a 1500 Duron, which will probably run at 1.3GHz. In the second quarter, a 1900 Athlon for notebooks will emerge. All of these chips will be based on the processor cores of Thoroughbred, or Appaloosa, a discount version of Thoroughbred. These new chips will also consume less heat than current AMD notebooks chips. Combined with new packaging, the new chips will allow AMD to break out of the "desktop replacement" segment of the notebook market and get into the increasingly popular "thin and light" notebooks, said Dirk Meyer, group vice president of the computing products group. In desktops, a 2200 Athlon that will likely run at close to 1.8GHz will hit the market, to be followed by a 2400 and a 2600 in the second and third quarters, respectively. Toward the end of the year, a new version of Athlon, code-named Barton, will appear. Barton is essentially the same as the Thoroughbred Athlons but contains IBM's SOI (silicon-on-insulator) technology, which better insulates transistors and is used to increase performance or lower the power consumption of a processor. The plans for server chips will mostly follow the desktop plans in terms of speed, but will add capabilities for multiprocessing. A multiprocessing Athlon for servers will come out in the first half; a Duron version will appear in the second half. The first Hammer chips will then appear commercially in the third quarter of 2002. The Hammer family contains a different architecture than the Athlon family and can read both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. The desktop/notebook version of Hammer, called Clawhammer, is in the final stages of design, Meyer said, and will appear in engineering samples in the first half of 2002. It will cover 64 square millimeters on the 90-nanometer process. The first version will carry the model number 3400. "Our eighth-generation Hammer product will, through architectural enhancements, materially outperform our seventh-generation Athlon," Meyer said. Figuring out the chip speed by subtracting 300 or 400 from the model number, however, won't hold with the Hammer family. "The gap between the frequency and the model number will increase a little bit," Meyer said. Sledgehammer for servers will come in the first half of 2003, representing another delay. Originally due in the first half of 2002, the chip was pushed to the second half of 2002. Sledgehammer will differ from Clawhammer in that it will contain more cache and be aimed at servers. Trash talking No AMD conference would be complete without some Intel trash talk, and Sanders happily obliged. The cross-freeway rival is in trouble, he claimed, because of the problems inherent in the designs of the Pentium 4 and Itanium, the 64-bit server chip. The Pentium 4 is expensive to make and underperforms Athlon, he said. "I think Intel is trapped. When they designed the Pentium 4, they didn't expect to have a real competitor in the marketplace with a meaningful alternative," Sanders said. "They always underestimate us, and being underestimated is a good thing." Itanium, meanwhile, will suffer because of the difficulty of producing software applications for the chip. Itanium uses a different architecture than other Intel chips. Hammer, meanwhile, is compatible with existing 32-bit applications. "My biggest fear is that Intel will come out with a 32-bit processor with 64-bit extensions because it is the right thing to do," Sanders said. "The Itanium it turns out is a niche product...We are going to have a role in the industry because we better fulfill Microsoft's needs." Life won't be easy next year, Sanders and other executives noted. AMD likely won't return to profitability until the second quarter. Flash-memory prices will also continue to decline because of overcapacity in the industry. Flash revenue may not increase at AMD until the third quarter. The effort to get into servers will also eventually require endorsement from a major manufacturer, Sanders added. "At the end of the day, we need to get a Compaq, Dell or HP," he said. "IBM is going to be tough."
2004-08-31 - AMD to demonstrate dual-core chips Aiming to deflate archrival Intel, Advanced Micro Devices this week will show off its dual-core chips, which will start to trickle out toward the middle of next year. AMD on Tuesday will show off a Hewlett-Packard ProLiant server with four dual-core Opteron chips at a facility in Austin, Texas, bringing the functional number of chips in four-processor servers to eight. "When you load Microsoft (Server 2003), it shows up as eight processors," said Marty Seyer, vice president and general manager of the microprocessor business unit at AMD. The chip "taped out"--semiconductor shop talk meaning that the design was completed--in June, and AMD recently produced the samples that will be displayed in Austin, Seyer added. The news comes a week before the Intel Developer Forum, where Intel is expected to discuss dual-core Itanium, Xeon and Pentium chips for servers and desktops, and demonstrate at least one of these chips at the event. Right now, it is difficult to determine which company is ahead in coming out with dual-core chips, which increase performance while conserving energy. Intel has said it will come out with a dual-core Itanium toward the middle of next year and desktop parts in the second half, roughly the same schedule AMD proposes. Both companies have also had to delay projects recently, so today's deadlines are likely fluid. Intel revealed its proposed delivery dates for dual-core desktop chips in May, but AMD countered that it had been preparing to go dual-core for some time. (IBM already sells dual-core chips.) Partisans and companies on both sides of the issue will likely debate the issue furiously during the next year. Still, demonstrating dual-core chips at this early stage underscores the improved engineering and design capabilities of AMD. Although AMD has largely lagged Intel in their 31-year-plus rivalry, the smaller company has bested Intel with a number of design innovations in the past two years. Opteron was the first chip based on the x86 architecture--which is behind most of the desktop and server chips on the market today--to run 32-bit and 64-bit software. Intel disdained the idea but then abruptly announced its own 32/64-bit chips earlier this year. With Opteron, AMD also ushered in a high-speed link between chips, called HyperTransport, which has been adopted by many other manufacturers. HyperTransport, now called Direct Connect, connects the different chips to a server to each other and to peripheral devices such as graphics cards. The technology will also be used to connect the two processors sandwiched together on the same processor, Seyer said.
2005-02-23 - AMD to demo a dual-core desktop chip   Advanced Micro Devices is expected to show off a dual-core processor for desktops at its headquarters Wednesday, but is keeping tight lipped about the details. The chip, code-named Toledo, will feature two separate Athlon 64 processing cores on the same piece of silicon. It will start appearing in PCs in the second half of 2005, said Theresa DeOnis, desktop brand manager for AMD. Putting two cores on a chip will allow a computer to perform two tasks at once, she said, or run specially tweaked applications faster. Windows XP Professional will be the operating system of choice for many dual-core desktops, as it is already threaded to run two processors. "We don't have a lot of multithreaded applications on the market yet, but it (Toledo) will perform well in multitasking environments," she said. The chip will come in the same package and fit in the same PCs as current single-core Athlons, DeOnis said. Nonetheless, she declined to provide the clock speed or other details. AMD and rival Intel will both start coming out with dual-core chips this year. Each company can claim to be ahead of the other in different ways. Intel's first dual-core chip for desktops, code-named Smithfield, will come out in the second quarter, ahead of Toledo. AMD, however, will come out with a dual-core version of its Opteron chip for servers in the middle of the year. Intel won't have a dual-core Xeon until 2006, although it will release a dual-core Itanium in the second quarter. IBM has been selling a dual-core chip for servers, the Power4, for a few years. Dual-core chips are an easier fit for the server market, as many servers come with two processors already. However, the number of server chips shipped in a year pale in comparison to the number of desktop chips. Server customers are also notoriously conservative, so adoption won't take place immediately, analysts have said. In the market for high-end and game-oriented PCs, Intel will come out with a dual-core chip this year that will also sport HyperThreading, which effectively will allow the chip to mimic, to a certain degree, a four-processor system. AMD won't likely make a similar move until 2006, DeOnis said, but that's because most games aren't multithreaded and therefore can't effectively take advantage of two cores. Intel's first dual-core chip for notebooks, code-named Yonah, comes out late this year. AMD won't have a notebook chip until after Toledo. Toledo can be used in notebooks, DeOnis said, but it has a 110-watt thermal envelope, relatively high for a notebook chip.
2003-01-22 - AMD talks up Opteron chip  NEW YORK--Advanced Micro Devices is looking to drum up support for its forthcoming 64-bit Opteron server chip. Special coverage LinuxWorld 2003 Linux advocates gatherto promote the OS. Though the new processor won't make its debut until April, AMD is talking it up in front of the crowds at this week's LinuxWorld trade show here. During a keynote speech Wednesday, AMD CEO Hector Ruiz announced a host of new developments, including a new manufacturing partner, an evaluation program for customers to test Opteron servers, and new software for the chip. "We're here to support you, the open-source community," Ruiz told the audience. Working with Newisys and Sanmina-SCI, AMD will offer as many as 500 Opteron servers to potential partners and customers for testing and software development purposes. The company is hoping that good results from those servers will encourage early adoption among large corporations. Newisys is an important partner for Opteron, as the start-up is designing a server that primarily will be licensed to other manufacturers. The Opteron chip also got a vote of support at the show from manufacturer Eunix and from IBM's software group. Milpitas, Calif.-based Eunix said it will launch Acceleron, a line of heavy-duty Opteron servers to be shipped simultaneously with the Opteron chip. Pricing was not announced. Boston-based Angstrom Microsystems is also building an Opteron server. Meanwhile, IBM has released a test version of its newest DB2 database for Linux. At the trade show, AMD demonstrated the database program running in a version of SuSE's Linux operating system. The chipmaker also announced a new library of mathematical functions for use in developing engineering, scientific and financial software applications. Elsewhere, developers are already working on a wide range of software for Opteron, including several Linux applications and operating systems and a version of Microsoft's Windows. All of the announcements by AMD are part its strategy to champion the Opteron chip and help establish the company's role in offering 64-bit addressing in the business market. Using a technology AMD calls x86-64, the company added new instructions to the current x86 processor architecture that extended the chip to 64 bits of data. The move to 64 bits enhances performance for servers by allowing them to support much larger amounts of memory than current AMD Athlon chips, which manage only 32 bits of data. Thanks to the extra memory, a server can decrease access times for data by minimizing its need to seek out that data on a hard drive. AMD says its approach is better than rival technologies--which require new software--because x86-64 maintains compatibility with current 32-bit software, allowing companies to run their existing wares on the servers as well. Intel, for one, makes separate chips--its Xeon and Itanium--for 32-bit and 64-bit servers. Stepping up to 64-bit software requires a move to the new hardware. Some of AMD's earliest Opteron customer wins have been in supercomputers. Ruiz trumpeted AMD's successes there, including a machine Cray is building for Sandia National Laboratories. The computer, called Red Storm, will incorporate more than 10,000 Opteron chips.
2002-06-28 - AMD swings Hammer at server makers AMD increased its share of the PC processor market in part by lowering the costs for computer makers, and in 2003 it will try the same thing with servers. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based chip manufacturer is touting the benefits of its Hammer chips for servers, which will be marketed under the names Opteron and Athlon. One of the expected advantages comes down to a comparatively low cost of designing, and subsequently managing, servers built around the chip. Unlike servers based on Intel processors, which require different chipsets for systems with one, two, four or eight processors, Athlon and Opteron servers would use chipsets that would be roughly identical regardless of the number of processors--dramatically cutting the amount of backroom engineering and design work. In other words, a four-processor Opteron server wouldn't be a rarified machine with its own distinct architecture and chipsets; it would be a one-way box replicated four times. "You won't have to have multiple chipsets and multiple designs," said Ed Ellett, vice president of marketing for AMD, who added that the company is having "good conversations" with server makers about using the chips. "The reality is that no one is going to cut over to AMD 100 percent, but the value proposition is high." The identical chipsets will also make the chips cheap for corporations to adopt in that IT managers will have to be educated to manage only one basic computer, Ellett added. It's a "fairly elegant" design, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. The server market remains one of the prime growth areas for companies like Intel, Microsoft, Dell Computer and, now, AMD. Although PC-based servers--or servers that use chips based on designs originally from Intel--have been around for years, the traditional RISC/Unix server manufacturers like Sun Microsystems continue to snatch the bulk of the revenue and dominate the upper echelons of the market. PC-based servers may have accounted for 88.4 percent of the servers sold in the first quarter, but that adds up to only 40 percent of the revenue, according to statistics compiled from IDC reports. Two weeks from now, Intel will try to move further up the ladder with Itanium 2, a new processor that will be incorporated into servers containing four to 64 chips. Similarly, AMD will seek to attack Intel underneath with the Hammer family. Opteron, for two- to eight-processor servers, and Hammer-based Athlons, for one- and two-chip servers and workstations, will ship to manufacturers in the first quarter of 2003 and appear commercially in the first half of that year--one year after originally planned. The key ingredient behind Hammer computers lies largely in how the chips communicate with one another. In traditional servers, the processors funnel instructions through a common chipset, which connects to main memory, hard drives and peripheral devices. Because chipsets serve as the main artery between the processor and the rest of the world, thousands of engineering hours are consumed in developing and debugging them. Delays on the most complex chipsets are fairly common. The differing performance requirements between server classes also mean that chipsets for one-, two-, four- and eight-processor servers are different from one another. By contrast, traffic inside Opteron servers gets dispersed. Memory is located next to each processor, and the processors are connected to each other through HyperTransport links, a high-speed, chip-to-chip interconnection protocol invented by AMD. To obtain data, processors issue commands that travel around a high-speed ring road connecting suburbs of memory, rather than going on the trek across the bridge to a massive memory bank. The processors must still share a common gateway for communicating with input-output devices, but the traffic across the common channels is greatly reduced because of the HyperTransport web connecting the processors and memory. A conceptually similar interconnect architecture is used inside IBM's Regatta server. In addition, the memory controller, usually a separate chip, is integrated into the chips of the Hammer family, speeding data transmission even more. Ironing out the kinks Like Intel, AMD will work with server makers, software developers and potential customers to smooth out kinks in the adoption curve as part of its "Rolling Thunder" campaign to build support for Hammer. The company will create and freely license reference designs for building two-processor Athlon servers and will work with the major Taiwanese manufacturers to deliver boards to market. Regional server manufacturers believe the chips will be a hit with customers. "A lot of people are anxious for the Hammer technology," said Roland Baker, president of Net Express, which makes servers and workstations for universities, chip designers and the number-crunching departments in corporations. A number of the company's customers have recently switched from buying AMD-based servers to Intel-based servers because Intel has dropped prices and increased speeds on its Xeon chips. However, the pendulum will likely swing back if Hammer lives up to the promises. "People will have no hesitation about going back to AMD," Baker said. "The price is less, and they want to support the underdog. This is not us promoting it. That is what the customers are telling us." AMD also will collaborate with the major manufacturers to work on their own designs. So far, none have publicly announced that they will produce an AMD-based server for the North American market. Some last year said they had little interest in it. But Ellett said that all of them are testing the chips in their labs. "We have all of the top-tier server manufacturers interested in our products," Ellett said. Landing those deals, though, will be difficult. Most of the major server makers have already invested millions of dollars in creating servers based on their own chips, as well as servers that use Intel's Xeon and Itanium chips. Some European and Japanese manufacturers have used AMD chips for servers but in limited capacities. "The only real issue in my mind is whether AMD will be able to convince HP or IBM or someone else of that ilk to sell them," said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64. "They've got to score some success in the enterprise space or at least the small-business space." The company has won backing from Microsoft for the Hammer chips. Despite the challenges, Brookwood complimented the company on its homework. "They've put a lot of effort into the platform aspect of Hammer as well as the instruction-set architecture," he said. Major manufacturers, moreover, will likely use the Hammer version of Athlon first, for one- and two-processor servers, and not Opteron, for four- and eight-ways. Still, it will take only one of the major manufacturers to find success in switching to begin generating more widespread interest, McCarron said. Besides, the regional specialists and system integrators, along with the "white box" manufacturers in the developing markets, are growing at the expense of the major brands. "The white-box guys aren't doing any independent R&D," McCarron said.
2006-07-19 - AMD seeks to gain in rivalry with Intel    Early last summer, Phil Hester ducked into a Starbucks in Austin, Tex., to meet with Hector Ruiz, the chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices. He was less interested in a latte than in hearing Ruiz's pitch: Did he want to join AMD and help lead its battle against Intel, its giant rival in the chip business? Hester, a well-known figure in the microprocessor industry, had chosen a place where he was not likely to be recognized. After spending the 1980s and 1990s at IBM, he understood the competitive situation AMD faced. When he was offered the job of running the company's technology development, he barely hesitated. "The attraction of AMD was I thought it was a really good company that had a really good shot at becoming a great company," Hester said. In the 10 months since Hester became AMD's chief technology officer, it has chalked up some victories and gained market share at Intel's expense. Now investors want to know whether he can help the company extend its technological success in the face of a renewed assault from Intel. "AMD has really been strengthening its R&D over the past five years," said Nathan Brookwood, a principal analyst at the consulting and market research firm Insight64. "They've brought in people who've been fighting these kinds of battles for years." Brookwood said of Hester: "He's really been through it all. He knows the issues; he knows what customers want." Hester joined AMD at the same time that the company announced that the executive widely credited with the success of the company's Opteron chip, Fred Weber, was leaving to run a start-up. Hester, who had spent the previous five years running a high-performance computing company that was one of the first customers for the Opteron, was taking on a weighty responsibility. Tribute to Opteron Inside AMD's Silicon Valley headquarters, the Opteron chip has the revered status of an Olympic champion. After all, it was the Opteron that propelled the company to overtake Intel, the longtime market leader, in the business of selling chips for computer servers, one of the fastest-growing segments of the microprocessor industry. Opteron won a huge early lead in the server market in part because it could run high-performance 64-bit programs at the same time as 32-bit programs, making it an instant hit with technology managers eager to protect their software investments. Since its release in 2003, the processor has been updated to run cooler and to conserve power. With the arrival of Hester, who works mostly out of the company's Austin offices, AMD's efforts to bolster its technology ranks are largely complete. Hester reports to Dirk R. Meyer, a longtime AMD executive who was appointed president in January, and works closely with Hector Ruiz, the chairman and chief executive. After nine quarters of giving up ground to AMD in the overall microprocessor market, Intel has been striking back, starting with deep price-cutting earlier this year that has eaten into demand for AMD's chips. AMD recently warned Wall Street that its second-quarter sales, which it will report Thursday, will be 9 percent below its first-quarter total, missing analysts' forecasts. The company said sales of notebook and desktop processors had dipped in the quarter, and analysts pointed to Intel's drastic price cuts as the cause. On Tuesday, Intel introduced a major new version of Itanium, its chip for high-end computers that, since its release five years ago, has been largely a disappointment. The new version promises faster performance and less energy use. And next week, Intel officially rolls out a new desktop computer chip named Core 2 Duo, earlier dubbed Conroe, that is based on the company's new Core architecture. Intel has already announced a Core Xeon chip for servers called Woodcrest, and next month it is expected to announce a Core chip for notebook computers. New efficiency, performance standards With Woodcrest, Intel says it will reduce power consumption by 35 percent while improving computing performance by more than 80 percent, closing its performance gap with AMD considerably. Reports from technology consultants who have worked with early versions of Conroe indicate that it does in fact give Intel a big lead in performance, particularly the version used in machines aimed at serious video game fans. "This new architecture is very critical to Intel retaining its lead," said Dean McCarron, an analyst at Mercury Research. "There's no question it dramatically changes the competitive position of Intel's products." Richard Whittington, an analyst with Caris & Co., said in a report last week that the new technology had the potential to help Intel win back some major ground in its biggest market, chips for desktop computers. Hester and other AMD executives say that the technology in its laboratories gives them plenty of reason for optimism, and that in some product categories Intel is just catching up to advances AMD pioneered. Just next month, for example, AMD is expected to introduce improvements to Opteron, and both companies are designing chips to run cooler and consume less energy. Being the underdog creates a culture of cooperation. --Phil Hester, chief technology officer, AMD Much like Intel, AMD is working to increase the number of processors on each chip from two to four, and the company says it will introduce new designs for servers and desktop systems that will be released in mid-2007, followed later in the year by a new design for notebooks. Many analysts are also expecting the company to counter Intel's pricing moves with price cuts of its own. At AMD's annual conference for analysts last month, Hester also disclosed an unusual plan to let other manufacturers build chips that work closely with its own chips, indicating an openness and flexibility that has not been seen before in the company's strategy. With that effort, referred to as Torrenza, AMD is licensing some of its chip specifications to other technology developers so they can add specialized functions, like advanced graphics and math processing. "We want to open up our technology and unleash a completely new wave of innovation," Ruiz told analysts at the conference. Market-share ambitions Advanced Micro has picked up about five percentage points of market share over the past year, nearly all of that from Intel, according to Mercury Research. Today, AMD's overall share is about 21 percent, to Intel's 74 percent, and at the analyst meeting Ruiz said the goal was to have a 30 percent share by 2008. Hester said AMD's road map for new products had not changed much since his arrival. Mostly he has focused on improving the way employees manage projects and pushing them to develop multiple designs at one time. He said he also emphasized cooperation inside development teams, rather than having teams compete for attention. The competitive situation has helped with this. "Being the underdog creates a culture of cooperation," Hester said. Hester, who is 51, spent more than two decades in various positions at IBM's Austin offices, and in his last job there he ran the personal computing business. He is widely credited with paving the way for the PowerPC, a popular chip architecture. In 2000, Hester left IBM, and he and a partner founded Newisys (pronounced new-EYE-sis), one of the first server companies to sell an Opteron-based product. They sold the company three years later for an undisclosed amount. Despite a travel schedule that has allowed him to accumulate seven million frequent-flier miles over the course of his career, Hester, who was born and raised in Corpus Christi, Tex., has never ventured far from home for long. He said he turned down several new assignments at IBM to avoid having to move out of Texas. These days he sometimes leaves the office by 4:30 to get home in time to go jet-skiing on a nearby lake with his 14-year-old son. Hester pointed to one measure of AMD's recent success: the number of computer companies that have committed to building products based on its processors. In May, AMD had a major coup when Dell, which had been strictly an Intel customer, announced that it would begin to use AMD's Opteron chip in some of its servers. While Dell insists the commitment is very limited, Hester is confident the Dell relationship will broaden. "To me the best indication of whether you're doing the right thing are the design wins you have in the market," Hester said, referring to Dell's choice of AMD's chips.
2000-08-15 - AMD seeks Linux developers for 64-bit chip software    Advanced Micro Devices is putting money and energy into recruiting Linux developers to write software for Hammer, the company's 64-bit processor that will first appear in late 2001. Under an initiative announced today at LinuxWorld in San Jose, Calif., AMD said that is has created a Web site for Linux developers and will ship participants a "technology simulator" of the chip next month so that the companies can begin to move their operating systems and applications to Hammer. AMD will also fund other Linux-Hammer related initiatives, sources have said. The move parallels the approach taken by AMD rival Intel, which invested in VA Linux Systems and helped other companies bring Linux to its upcoming 64-bit Itanium chip. The company essentially is trying to make it as easy and as inexpensive as possible for companies to write software for the processor. Executives from Red Hat Software, SuSE and other Linux companies saluted the move. Hammer, which was earlier code-named Sledgehammer, is AMD's most ambitious project to date. The chip will run software designed for 32-bit processors, such as Intel's Pentium III and AMD's Athlon, as well as software for 64-bit chips, a class of processors that includes Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc, Compaq Computer's Alpha and Intel's upcoming Itanium. Samples of Hammer will emerge in late 2001, with commercial availability likely following in 2002, Bob Mitton, division marketing manager at Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD, said last week. Moving to 64-bit chips--as long as there's an operating system and other software that can take advantage of them--enables the use of much larger databases and other advantages. For this shift, though, the companies have chosen different paths. Intel has chosen to develop a completely new language, called IA-64, for communicating with Itanium and subsequent 64-bit chips. Sledgehammer, though, uses an architecture AMD calls x86-64, an extension of Intel's 32-bit architecture. However, to run on these new chips, Linux and its accompanying programming tools must know how to speak the chips' native tongues. AMD began releasing details on how to communicate with Sledgehammer earlier this week. SuSE said one of its programmers, Jan Hubicka, has produced the first versions of programming tools necessary to develop Linux and other software for Sledgehammer. Other companies involved in AMD's x86-64 effort include CodeSourcery, which has experience in programming tools, scientific and technical computing firm Portland Group, and others. SuSE, a German company that is one of the four major sellers of the Unix-like operating system, plans to hold an initial public offering, chief technology officer Dirk Hohndel has said. With its primary use on servers today, Linux could provide a new way for AMD to attack the business market. To date, AMD's chips have been used almost exclusively in consumer computers. With the upcoming Mustang chip and Sledgehammer, however, the company will try to enter the market for corporate desktops and servers. AMD is already gaining peripheral penetration into the corporate market. Net Express, a small server and workstation specialist in the San Francisco Bay Area, has sold single-processor Athlon servers running Linux to a number of established companies, said Roland Baker, Net Express CEO. Penguin Computing CEO Sam Ockman, however, added that AMD will need to popularize chipsets for making multiprocessor servers before commercial acceptance of their chips takes off. Penguin is actually dropping Athlon from one of its server lines. AMD's first multiprocessor server chipset comes out later this year. "For our market, what we need a server to be is rack-mount friendly and capable of multiprocessing," Ockman said. Still, other small companies and even motherboard makers have said that they are seeing a shift in resistance to AMD in corporations. The 32- and 64-bit designations refer to the amount of data that a processor can handle in a single instruction: The larger the number, the more information the chip can digest in one gulp. With 64-bit chips, server makers also can incorporate much more memory into their machines, the key feature for speeding up access to large databases. Sledgehammer will use the same basic instruction set as the Athlon but will contain features that allow the chip to run 64-bit programs. As a result, software makers need only retrofit their existing programs, not write completely new ones. "This is the conservative step approach. It is not a major disruption," Bob Mitton, division marketing manager at AMD, said earlier this month. "If it's not broke, why fix it?"
2003-04-21 - AMD rolls dice on Opteron chip Advanced Micro Devices will come out with a new chip on Tuesday--and once again, everything is on the line. Read more about Opteron The Opteron processor, first revealed in 1999, represents the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company's best opportunity ever to sell chips to corporate customers and into the lucrative server market. The chip sports two major features for enhancing performance--HyperTransport, for linking chips, and an integrated memory controller for speeding up the data flow between memory and the processor. Benchmarks from AMD suggest that the chip will increasingly outperform Intel's equivalent Xeon chip. More importantly, the Opteron can run 32-bit Windows-Linux software, which is found on desktops and small servers around the world, and 64-bit software, which is used on high-end servers. The 64-bit software that will run on the chip will be almost identical to the kinds of applications and operating systems corporate customers use now, making it easy and cheap to adopt. A desktop version of the chip, called Athlon 64, which can be used on anything from laptops to scientific workstations, comes out belatedly in September. Intel chips aren't as ambidextrous. Instead, the company sells Pentiums and Xeons for, respectively, PCs and midsize servers, and it sells Itanium 2 for the 64-bit market. Pentiums and Xeons run the same software, but Itanium 2 requires entirely different code, which can be costly to develop and test. Itanium's software isolation in part has retarded sales, analysts and executives have said, adding to the appeal of AMD's one-chip solution. "Intel will ultimately have no choice but to respond," said Dirk Meyer, a senior vice president at AMD. "If we didn't exist, I think Intel would be in a position to drive Itanium down everyone's throat. But we do exist, and we are going to offer an alternative, and even a virtual monopolist like Intel is going to respond at some point." Smaller manufacturers like RackSaver will release Opteron servers this week, and analysts believe that big companies like IBM could follow suit. If that happens, AMD will be able to compete against Intel in everything--not just the consumer and small-business segment, which accounts for only around 30 percent of the total market. Microsoft, IBM and Linux companies currently are writing software for the chip. Then again, this is AMD--a company that seems perpetually stuck in a Sisyphean nightmare. In the past 16 years, AMD has had eight profitable years and eight in the red. Total net earnings since the end of 1986, including acquisitions and sell-offs, comes to around $350 million, about the same as Intel earns in six weeks. Bringing Opteron to market hasn't been easy. Both the server and desktop versions of the chip were originally due in late 2001, but they kept getting pushed back, in part because of technical problems. The chip will debut at 1.8GHz, slightly lower than expectations. Although the company has made its share of mistakes, its biggest problem is Intel, which has more engineers, fabrication facilities, money and connections. "We only have one competitor, and that one is pretty awesome," AMD CEO Hector Ruiz said in an interview late last year. Intel is "huge, and they have a lot of smart people." Nonetheless, AMD executives and most analysts assert that the historical pattern is ready to be broken. The company has shed its reputation for haphazard manufacturing and boasts one of the premier semiconductor design teams in the world. "For the last 10 years they get themselves to the brink of death and then come back. They are great at the last-minute comeback," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. "But Opteron is a reliable, corporate-server play. If it gets traction, then everything (AMD makes) is acceptable." Opteron under the hood The underlying theme of the Opteron is memory and its problems. Memory, which stores data required by the processors, remains one of the chief bottlenecks in computer performance. Memory runs at a far slower rate than the processor, a mismatch that leaves the processor spinning in idle as it waits for data. The physical distance between memory and the processor also creates a lag. All three of the touted features of the Opteron work to resolve this problem. Integrating the memory controller effectively shrinks the first part of the pipeline between the memory and the processor, thereby speeding up performance. HyperTransport shrinks the latter part of the pipeline. In current multiprocessor servers, the processors and memory trade data over a central system bus, similar to a bridge or freeway that connects the suburbs to a central business district. Designing a chipset for an eight-processor server is often fraught with difficulties and delays because of the complexities in designing an efficient bus. In HyperTransport servers, the central bus is eliminated. Instead, processors and memory are spread out and united by a high-speed ring road, similar to the decentralized live-work areas that have become common in high-population areas. Additionally, Opteron comes with 16 registers, or data holding bays, instead of eight like existing chips using the so-called X86 architecture, which is the basis for current Intel and AMD chips. "The X86 architecture is fine, but if it has any one limitation it is in the limited number of registers," AMD's Meyer said. "Going from eight to 16 may not sound like much in comparison to RISC architectures (like IBM's Power 4 chip) with tens of registers, but you get essentially 80 percent of the benefit going from eight to 16." The reasoning behind Opteron's 64-bit characteristic revolves around memory. Current computers with 32-bit chips can only manage 4GB of memory, while a 64-bit computer can handle vastly more. Databases and other applications perform better with more memory because it allows the processor to access more data rapidly without having to dig it out of the disk drive. Intel's Itanium provides the same ability, but it's far less convenient and much more expensive, AMD executives say. With Opteron, computer makers and software developers only have to tweak their products modestly to get them to take advantage of the 64-bit characteristics, according to Fred Weber, AMD's chief technical officer. IBM ported its DB2 database over in the course of just a few days with a couple of engineers, he noted. For corporate customers, this means an easy adoption curve. Opteron also will be far less expensive than Itanium, which starts at $1,338. Adding the 64-bit ability only increased the size of the chip by a small percentage, Weber said. Initial prices for the Opteron range from $283 to $794. That means cheaper hardware. Large hardware makers are intrigued. Newisys, which is licensing an Opteron-based server design to other manufacturers, says that virtually every major manufacturer is testing the chip. "The large hardware manufacturers are watching each other to see who bites. If one of them does, the others will be (pressured) to do it as well," said Mike Feibus, principal analyst at TechKnowledge. "I don't see any resistance at the (information technology) level. It is all with the computer makers." Problems ahead Intel, of course, isn't taking the challenge lying down. The company will upgrade its Xeon processor line in the near future and has been working to popularize its Itanium 2 chip. Richard Wirt, an Intel fellow and one of the company's senior chip designers, said he meets with researchers and developers and Oracle on a weekly basis to optimize performance. Overall, Intel has spent millions on rounding out the corners on Itanium 2. And although performance of the first Itaniums was disappointing, recent benchmarks have put Itanium 2 toward the top of the heap. A new version, code-named Madison, will further boost output. Invite Michael Kanellos into your in-box Senior department editor Michael Kanellos scrutinizes the hardware industry in a weekly column that ranges from chips to servers and other critical business systems. Enterprise Hardware every Wednesday. "Across the board you are looking at about 50 percent improvements in performance," said John Miller, product marketing manager for business-critical systems at Hewlett-Packard, which will adopt Madison across its high-end server line. Sales have picked up as well. Oil giant BP, Swiss laboratory CERN and a number of research institutions have adopted Itanium. Dell Computer, an early critic of the chip, has said it will sell Itanium 2 servers. Additionally, AMD has a sordid history to live down. Although it's shown it can create award-winning chips, making them in volume profitably has proved elusive. Compaq Computer shocked the PC world in 1995 by announcing its intent to adopt AMD's K5, a decision it reversed after performance problems emerged. With the K6 and K6-II, AMD gained market share and simultaneously lost billions. In mid-1999, the Athlon won rave reviews and contracts with Hewlett-Packard, Sony, IBM and Gateway. Two-and-a-half years later, the company has about 13.8 percent of the processor market, or around the same amount it did before the Athlon arrived. Although the self-imposed problems have faded, Mercury Research's McCarron and others point out that big computer companies are conservative to a fault and rarely like to take risks. Even if AMD can manufacture flawlessly however, the company will face another obstacle: indifference. While 64-bit performance sounds great on paper, actual demand in the broad market could be far off. In the server market, more than 80 percent of the servers sold are 32-bit machines. Most Opteron servers sold, therefore, will be basic 32-bit machines. In desktops, 64 bits may not be in the picture for years. Memory can, at most, account for 8 percent to 10 percent of the cost of building a PC, according to memory and PC executives. Although memory prices are dropping fast, 4GB of memory is more expensive now than many desktops. High-end PCs with 4GB of memory will still be rare in 2005, according to Dataquest analyst Andrew Norwood. These computers won't even be mainstream by 2007, according to Sherry Garber, an analyst at Semico. By that time, AMD will be selling new chips, and the current Athlon 64 and Opteron designs will be a distant memory. Intel executives have said they probably won't bring 64 bits to the desktop until near the end of the decade. Besides, the company has technology that can let 32-bit computers exceed the 4GB limit, although not to the same degree as 64-bit chips. In the end, what AMD will likely need is a computer maker to carry the 64-bit flag. "What is absolutely critical is to get those top-tier manufacturers," said Gordon Haff, a senior analyst at Illuminata.
1999-10-07 - AMD reports a loss but beats expectations  AMD, a company with grand plans but short-term difficulties, today soundly beat analysts' earnings expectations by 25 cents. The chipmaker and Intel rival reported a net loss of 72 cents per share for the third quarter. It was expected to lose 97 cents per share for the quarter, according to financial analysts surveyed by First Call. The loss is considerably greater than the 1-cent-per-share profit from the same quarter a year ago but not as severe as the $1.10 loss posted last quarter. In the most recent quarter, AMD had revenues of $662 million, down 3 percent from the $686 million from the like quarter a year before. The company's net loss was $106 million. The company attributed its stronger-than-expected results to strong sales of its high-end--and higher profit margin--Athlon processor, as well 28 percent growth in its flash memory products from the quarter. In order to break even in the current quarter, AMD will have to achieve revenues of about $850 million, the company said, a hope that isn't likely, even with an expected surge in holiday sales. "This is a very tough goal," said AMD chief executive Jerry Sanders in a conference call today. "In the face of uncertainty [from Taiwan earthquake effects], it remains just that--a goal." In the last quarter, AMD earned $295 million from PC processor sales, Sanders said. In addition, AMD said it would sell its communications and networking chip business, which has been profitable for many quarters. Sanders declined to state how much the company expected to receive for the division, but he said AMD would keep access to the division's intellectual property so it could be used in chips to power devices such as TV set-top boxes and cell phones. AMD, while suffering from production issues and fierce competition from Intel, has potential for a rosier future, analysts have said. Yesterday, AMD unveiled plans to take on Intel's upcoming 64-bit Itanium chip by extending the current "x86" chip architecture instead of following Intel's plan of starting afresh with new architecture. Though analysts are cautious about AMD's ability to pull off such a grand plan, several at this week's Microprocessor Forum noted that AMD could clean up if Intel's Itanium plan stumbles. The Itanium, formerly code-named Merced, is due in mid-2000 and is the first in Intel's family of high-end "IA-64" chips. AMD's current high-performance Athlon chip, which has beat out current Pentiums from Intel, could fill current demand, while its new "x86-64" chips in 2001 could step in if Itanium flops. The Athlon chip is key to AMD's recovery plan. The high-end chip comes with a healthier average selling price and profit margin than the low-end K6-2 and K6-III chips that the firm has been better known for in the past. The company built 350,000 Athlon chips and shipped 200,000 in the last quarter as well as about 4.3 million of the K6-2 and K6-III chips, Sanders said. The reason more of the Athlons didn't make it into products was limitation on the number of "motherboards," the circuit boards that house CPUs and other computer innards. Where the overall average selling price for AMD was $65, the Athlons sold for an average of just under $300, AMD said. Compaq and IBM sell Athlon-based computers, but Sanders said more PC makers should be announced in coming months. In the current quarter, AMD would have been able to ship as many as a million Athlons, but the company is constrained by the Taiwan earthquake's effects on motherboards and other components, Sanders said. While AMD is confident it could make a million Athlons this quarter, earthquake uncertainties mean that the company likely only will ship 800,000. That means AMD likely won't meet the projections of Merrill Lynch analyst Joe Osha and BancBoston Robertson Stephens analyst Dan Niles, both of whom had expected a million Athlons to ship in the current quarter. Part of the reason AMD beat expectations was through cutting costs. Capital investments for chip factories were delayed until 2000, AMD said. AMD showed prototypes of its Athlon chip running at 800 MHz this week that used new copper interconnect technology and built on a process that can etch details as small as 0.18 micron. "We're on track for 1 GHz by the end of next year," Sanders said. Athlons running at 750 MHz also will debut in the first quarter of 2000, he said. In fact, this will be the last month AMD makes Athlon chips on the 0.25 micron process, Sanders said. Revenue from those chips should start arriving in the second quarter of 2000, he said. Motorola deal Another change that could help AMD is a possible deal with Motorola in which AMD could use its new Dresden, Germany, chip factory to build Motorola G4 chips. That deal would follow one AMD announced more than a year ago under which Motorola builds AMD's Athlon chips, formerly called K7s. Using AMD facilities also would help out Motorola, which has been unable to meet Apple's demand for new G4 chips. Making Motorola chips makes sense: Through a technology-swapping deal, the two companies expect to have identical chipmaking technology. AMD plans to announce an arrangement to help cover many of the costs of the new Dresden facility, Sanders said. "We're highly confident that we'll have an arrangement that will enable to not have to absorb all the costs," he said, though he declined to state whether AMD would build another company's chips there or whether another company would take a stake in the plant. AMD will use part of the Dresden facility's capacity to build flash memory, Sanders said. Flash memory sales brought in $195 million in revenue in the last quarter, the company said.
2000-08-10 - AMD releasing details on 64-bit Sledgehammer   Some of the mystery surrounding Sledgehammer, the 64-bit processor coming from Advanced Micro Devices, will be lifted today when the company posts a technical manual geared at recruiting software developers to the project. The document, called the Architecture Programmers' Overview, explains the technical principles underlying Sledgehammer, the successor to the Athlon processor. Sledgehammer is slated to appear in samples by late 2001. Commercial shipments will likely start in 2002, according to AMD. "The higher-level architecture is done," said Bob Mitton, division marketing manager at AMD. "We want to start to roll it out and get everyone to look at it." Sledgehammer is one of the company's most ambitious projects to date. The chip will run software designed for 32-bit processors, such as Intel's Pentium III and AMD's Athlon, as well as software for 64-bit chips, a class of processors that includes Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc, Compaq Computer's Alpha and Intel's upcoming Itanium. The 32- and 64-bit designation refers to the amount of data that a processor can handle in a single instruction: The larger the number, the more data that can be processed at one time. With 64-bit chips, server makers also can incorporate much more memory in their machines. Itanium and Sledgehammer differ in the type of 64-bit programs they will run. For Itanium and its successors, Intel and Hewlett-Packard developed an entirely new instruction set, or processing protocols, for the chip. Software is being developed to recognize Itanium's instruction set. By contrast, Sledgehammer will use the same basic instruction set as the Athlon but will contain features that allow the chip to run 64-bit programs. As a result, software makers only need to retrofit their programs, not write completely new ones. "This is the conservative step approach. It is not a major disruption," Mitton said. "If it's not broke, why fix it?" Similarly, Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD will only need to concentrate on one chip family. The underlying core of Sledgehammer chips in desktops, notebooks and servers will essentially be identical, Mitton said. It will be up to computer manufacturers to decide whether to have a given processor run as a 32-bit or 64-bit chip when they assemble their machines. The core of Intel's 64- and 32-bit chips will be different for years. The question, of course, is whether the chip will prove to be effective in both types of machines. Making a chip ambidextrous almost always creates a performance hit. With Itanium and its successors, Intel is aiming to provide optimal performance with 64-bit chips. These processors will run standard 32-bit applications, but with no performance enhancements. The big issue for Sledgehammer is how well it will run 64-bit applications. The chip will likely perform fine in desktops, but adoption by server companies may be slow if Sledgehammer can't approximate Itanium's performance. "With compatibility, the positive is that you are bringing everyone along. The negative is that you are carrying baggage," said Mike Feibus, principal analyst at Mercury Research. AMD also faces the challenge of keeping costs down. In some ways, though, AMD can't lose, said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. If it works, AMD will gain entry into the market for high-end servers without having to spend huge amounts in research and development. If it doesn't work, the company will have a fast desktop processor. AMD will also potentially enjoy an advantage in convenience. Migrating to a new instruction set is painful, difficult and expensive for everybody, including the chipmaker and software developer. "As long as you maintain binary compatibility, it becomes a no-brainer because there are no software compatibility issues," Brookwood said. AMD, in fact, won't be the first company with an ambidextrous chip. In 1985, Intel was working on a 32-bit chip called the 432 to replace the 16-bit 286. The 432 contained an entirely new instruction set. "It was going to be a really nifty machine. All the serious architects were working on it," Brookwood said. Intel, however, killed the project and instead released the 386, a 32-bit version of the 286 that also read 16-bit code. One of the chief engineers on the project was Pat Gelsinger, who has since become Intel's chief technical officer. "The second string became heroes," Brookwood said.
2002-10-16 - AMD releases Opteron benchmarks    SAN JOSE, Calif.--Advanced Micro Devices released prospective performance benchmarks for its upcoming server chip Opteron, and it appears the chip could land near the head of its class. At the Microprocessor Forum here this week, AMD's chief technology officer, Fred Weber, said that during tests in the company's labs, a server running a 2GHz Opteron achieved an "estimated" SPECint 2000 score of 1,202 and an estimated SPECfp 2000 score of 1,170, higher than most competing chips on the market today. The score on the SPECint benchmark, which measures how rapidly the chip processes integer calculations, is particularly interesting because server customers look at the figure when considering purchases. Most SPECint scores today are below 1,000, noted Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64. SPECfp is used to judge mathematical abilities more relevant to workstations or supercomputers. Also at the industry confab, Intel discussed how it might construct a chip containing multiple Itanium cores (a core is the computing engine on a processor). Although the AMD benchmarks were produced in lab conditions, and Weber declined to elaborate on the technical details behind the server and chip used in the tests, the scores indicate that the chip is more or less hitting the early performance claims made by AMD. The benchmark figures could help the company in its push to get its chips into the mainstream server market. Sources who requested anonymity, however, said the figures have to be taken with a large grain of salt. Outside of AMD's labs, not many have had an opportunity to play with the Opteron or other members of the Hammer family. Other than the test scores, Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD kept a tight lid on details surrounding Opteron and other members of the Hammer line. Opteron will appear in the first half of 2003, said Mark Bode, division marketing manager of the desktop products group at the company. Bode said the desktop version of Hammer will hit shelves in March or April and the notebook version, like Opteron, will publicly debut sometime in the first half. Although Weber discussed a 2GHz Opteron, the company has not committed to releasing the chip at that speed. Analysts have said the first chip could run at speeds between 2GHz and 2.4GHz. AMD earlier said the chip would be marketed with a 3400+ performance number. The Hammer family will be able to run both 32-bit software, the kind found on desktops today, and 64-bit software, found on high-end servers. Although 64-bit software won't be common for years in the desktop world, where the vast majority of AMD's chips are sold, the ambidextrous nature of the processor means AMD will be ready when desktops finally make the jump. "Will it be in 2005, or 2006 or 2007? It is not clear, but it is in that time frame," Weber said. By contrast, Intel has separate chip families for the 32-bit world and the 64-bit world, a situation AMD's Weber called "a house of cards" during a panel speech. Intel declined to respond to the comment, but stated that it is committed to its chip families. Split Itanium personality In its presentation, Intel discussed how it might construct a multicore Itanium chip. The company has already said it will come out with multicore chips, but hasn't said how they might be built. Multicore chips are becoming a reality because by 2007 chips will have a billion transistors, and you have to do something with all those wires, said John Crawford, a Fellow in Intel's Enterprise Group. Using 1 billion transistors, Intel could put four separate Itanium cores onto a chip, Crawford said. These cores would then share a common cache, similar to IBM's Power4 on sale today. A mega-chip of this sort could benefit computer designers in a number of ways. A four-processor server would be far easier to construct because it would require far fewer chips. Applications could also jump from one core to another to avoid building up "hot spots," Crawford added. Intel has discussed such core-hopping technology in the past. "We are spreading out hot spots across the die into four areas," Crawford said. He didn't say Intel would actually make an Itanium with four brains, but he said that it was "eminently doable." Other Intel executives have said multicore chips are inevitable. The billion transistor budget could also be use to build encryption functions right into a chip and to create better processing for .Net and Java, Crawford added.
2001-01-31 - AMD offers Linux simulator for 64-bit chips    NEW YORK--Advanced Micro Devices has released a Linux version of a simulator application to help programmers write software for its upcoming 64-bit chips. AMD hopes Linux will increase the popularity of its upcoming Sledgehammer chip, prototypes of which are expected late this year, with final versions coming in the first half of 2002. AMD demonstrated the software Wednesday at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo trade show here. Sledgehammer is a 64-bit chip, which means it can accommodate vastly larger amounts of memory. It will compete with established server chips from Sun Microsystems, Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard and IBM. And chipmaking heavyweight Intel is aggressively helping Linux programmers embrace its 64-bit chip, the much-delayed Itanium. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD, like numerous other companies, sees Linux as a useful way to get ahead of the competition. Linux is readily adaptable to numerous chip designs and has an army of willing programmers advancing it into just about any new frontier. The simulation software from AMD, called VirtuHammer, will help programmers simulate the upcoming chips on existing computers. Intel, assisted by Itanium co-inventor HP, took similar measures with Itanium. VirtuHammer was developed by Virtutech, a Swedish company that develops simulation software. AMD was working with competitor Transmeta on a Sledgehammer emulator, according to developers and sources close to the deal. Under the deal, Transmeta was to receive a license to manufacture chips containing Sledgehammer technology, while AMD would send developers Transmeta-based computers running a simulator. Subsequently, AMD switched to the Swedish emulator. Itanium speaks what amounts to a different language than current x86 Intel chips. AMD's Hammer family speaks a close relative called x86-64. AMD's staunch ally in the effort is SuSE, a German Linux seller. SuSE programmer Jan Hubicka released programming tools for the new AMD chip family at the last Linux trade show in August. SuSE competes chiefly with Linux companies Red Hat, Caldera Systems and Turbolinux, as well as Linux foe Microsoft. Computing giants including IBM, Compaq, HP, Oracle and Dell Computer are showing their support for Linux at the trade show.
2006-03-29 - AMD lures high-ranking Itanium designer    Advanced Micro Devices has hired Samuel Naffziger, a high-ranking designer of Intel's Itanium processors, and eight of his Fort Collins, Colo.-based colleagues working on the high-end processor. Naffziger, one of about 50 at Intel who held the rank of fellow, was director of Itanium circuits and technology. He joined the chipmaker in 2005 when Intel hired Itanium designers from Hewlett-Packard, where Naffziger led the Itanium design team for eight years. Sam Naffziger At AMD, he is a senior fellow and will work on design development, spokesman Phil Hughes said, declining to share further details about what he or the eight other Itanium engineers will do. Because of a 2003 acquisition, AMD has a design center in Longmont, Colo., not far from Fort Collins. While not the only high-ranking designer behind the Itanium line--Intel argues it still has a deep bench--Naffziger played a leading role. He introduced two major Itanium models to the world at the International Solid State Circuits Conference, the "McKinley" version in 2002 and "Montecito" in 2005. Naffziger's departure was reported by Real World Technologies. Intel has had troubles with Itanium--most recently a delay pushing Montecito from 2005 to the second quarter of 2006, which Pat Gelsinger, Intel's top server executive, acknowledged this month was an "embarrassment." But Intel, HP and other Itanium allies still envision a bright future and are spending billions of dollars to restore Itanium's fortunes. Some of that funding is going to an expansion of Itanium engineering staff, Gelsinger said. AMD took a different approach. Instead of creating a new, incompatible processor family, it beefed up its existing x86 processor line with features such as 64-bit memory addressing. Intel had for a time reserved that only for Itanium, but eventually added those features to its successful Xeon x86 server chip family.
2000-06-14 - AMD Intel expand Linux support Chip rivals AMD and Intel bolstered their support for Linux this week in separate deals for developers. As previously reported, Intel and Hewlett-Packard released programming tools for developing Linux applications for Intel's Itanium processor. The two companies are distributing a free developer's toolkit for testing and running Linux applications. HP developed the toolkit's core component, the IA-64 emulator, which allows the development and testing of Linux applications for Itanium on existing Intel processors. "Broad availability of Linux applications is an important component of HP's Itanium processor-based server and workstation environment," Mike Balma, director of marketing for HP's Open Source and Linux operation, said in a statement. "HP's simulator gives ISVs and open-source developers the opportunity to accelerate their ports to IA-64 and bring applications to market more quickly." Not to be left out, AMD announced a strategic relationship with Lineo for providing embedded systems developers with Linux software for Internet appliances. The two companies will collaborate on providing Lineo's Embedix Linux on AMD's entire processor line, including K6 and Athlon. "By including Embedix Linux in the AMD development kits, we are able to eliminate many of the hardware and software integration issues experienced by developers when designing embedded solutions," Lineo CEO Bryan Sparks said in a statement. Also this week, IBM upped its support for Linux on larger servers and portables as well as software and services. Gartner analyst George Weiss warned Linux still has a long way to go in proving its viability against mature commercial operating systems. "There are factors users have to be particularly concerned about: the relative immaturity of Linux and its penetration into the enterprise with regard to its scalability and availability and many other factors," he said. Unlike competing commercial operating systems, such as Microsoft's Windows 2000 or Solaris from Sun Microsystems, Linux is an open-source effort where many programmers continually contribute to its development.
1999-10-05 - AMD Intel crank up high-end chip fight latest developments Is it a chip war or a Greek melodrama? In this corner, AMD will pit its SledgeHammer against Intel's Itanium, while in the other corner, Athlon takes on the Pentium III. "It's been more aggravated by the situation in Taiwan." - Ashok Kumar, an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. regarding the supply of Athlon-based PCs. AMD takes "SledgeHammer" to Intel The new chip marks AMD's attempt to get into the lucrative market for server and workstation processors, a segment it has long coveted, to compete with rival Intel. Intel names Merced chip Itanium update Itanium will be the official name of Intel's Merced processor, and the company will provide more details on the microarchitecture of the chip at the Microprocessor Forum. AMD speeds up Athlon chip The new chip means that AMD will continue to enjoy a speed and performance advantage over Intel's top chips, analysts say.
2002-04-30 - AMD gains on Intel sets Hammer speeds  Advanced Micro Devices gained a bit of ground on Intel in the first quarter, bolstered in part by growth in the markets for notebook and server chips, according to a research study. The company also announced speeds of its upcoming Hammer chip at a conference in San Francisco. In the first quarter, Intel accounted for 80.8 percent of the worldwide shipment of processors for PCs, a drop of 0.4 percent sequentially. The figures include shipments of chips for Microsoft's Xbox game console. AMD accounted for 18.2 percent of shipments, an increase of 0.2 percent sequentially. The remaining 1 percent of shipments came from other processor makers such as Via Technologies. The figures, from Mercury Research analyst Dean McCarron, do not include PowerPC shipments to Apple Computer. Meanwhile, AMD's chairman, Jerry Sanders, told an audience at Merrill Lynch's Hardware Heaven conference in San Francisco that Hammer, the company's forthcoming chip for desktops and servers, will debut at 2GHz or higher. Hammer will ship to PC makers in the fourth quarter and will be released to the public in the first quarter of 2003, Sanders added. The market share figures, to some degree, reflect the increased success AMD is having in penetrating the notebook and server market. Approximately 10 percent of AMD's processors in the first quarter went into notebooks, according to AMD. The company also claims it accounted for 6 percent of all server chips sold in the United States. While McCarron couldn't confirm those figures, he stated that the company is gaining in these markets. Less than a year ago, AMD had no presence in the server market, he noted. Concurrently, Intel benefited from sales of chips for the Xbox, a contract both companies sought. Without Xbox, Intel's market share in terms of shipments dropped 0.8 percent to 79.8 percent while AMD's market share rose 0.7 percent to 19.2 percent, according to Mercury. Although AMD is currently unprofitable, Sanders said it will continue to gain on Intel. Along with eking out more ground in servers and notebooks, the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company will make a push into China and other emerging markets where Intel remains dominant. "We see Asia-Pacific--which has been carrying our competitor--as an opportunity," Sanders said. "We do expect to grow our revenue and gain market share in 2002." Hammer will also begin to have an influence late in the year. The chip is capable of running 32-bit programs--the kind used on most desktops today--as well as 64-bit applications for servers. Last week, Microsoft said it planned to incorporate extensions into Windows so that it would run as a 64-bit operating system on Hammer. Effectively, this will allow Hammer to compete against Itanium, Intel's 64-bit chip. "For the first time, we have a product to compete against Itanium," said Sanders. "Without Microsoft's support, AMD would obviously not be able to go to the enterprise space." The flamboyant company founder went on to proclaim that Itanium would fail and that Intel would have to come out with a similar 32/64-bit chip to placate Dell Computer. Hammer is compatible with current applications; Itanium uses a separate architecture that requires a completely different set of software. Incompatibility will hinder acceptance, according to Sanders and some analysts. Itanium will also cost more to make, Sanders alleged. "The Intel Itanium will be a failure because it doesn't obey the immutable laws of our industry," Sanders said. "There are only two outcomes: 1) Dell will adopt Hammer, or 2) Intel will come out with an x86-64 (processor)." An Intel representative, while declining to comment on any 32/64-bit chip developments, said that Itanium enjoys broad support in the industry and will provide a new level of performance in the server market. "The industry needs a real 64-bit solution that provides all of the scalability and reliability that server manufacturers need. Intel delivers that," the representative said. The Hammer-Itanium argument will likely be one of the big debates of the year in the processor market. To date, Itanium has not sold well because of weak performance and a lack of software, according to PC executives and analysts. A new version of the chip, code-named McKinley, will hit the market midyear at 1GHz, along with more software. While even Intel expects the adoption of McKinley to be gradual, it doesn't necessarily portend a shift to Hammer. IBM, Hewlett-Packard (which co-created the Itanium architecture) and others have already heavily invested in building Itanium servers. These companies also have yet to adopt AMD chips for the mainstream corporate desktop market, let alone the more conservative server market. The wild card, potentially, is Dell. Dell executives have been openly skeptical about the demand for Itanium. Dell also retired an Itanium-based workstation from its product line. At the Merrill Lynch conference on Tuesday, CEO Michael Dell said the company is looking at Hammer and is interested in it. He even engaged in jovial banter with Sanders. However, Dell has regularly tested AMD's chips and never adopted them for a product. "We're very interested and we're looking and there's not much more to say about it in public," Dell said at the conference. In any event, Sanders said that at least Intel will not be able to tout larger megahertz numbers. With Hammer debuting at speeds of at least 2GHz, the chip will run faster than McKinley. Intel will thus be stuck trying to argue that megahertz is important in the desktop space, where it will likely be ahead, and that megahertz is not important in the server space, where it won't be. "You can't have it both ways," Sanders said. Hammer will be marketed under the Athlon brand for the desktop and notebook market and under the Opteron name for the server market. It will be given a performance rating number (an AMD rating) of 3400.
2003-06-30 - AMD expands Opteron chip line  Advanced Micro Devices on Monday rallied a new phalanx of Opteron processors for servers, on the same day that rival Intel also unveiled a battery of server chips. The chipmaker introduced the Opteron 800 and Opteron 100, the two latest versions of its 64-bit Opteron processor for servers. AMD created the 800 line for four-processor or eight-processor servers and the 100 line for single-processor servers. AMD wants to use Opteron to gain acceptance in the business market by helping to lower the price of 64-bit servers. A 64-bit server's inherent capabilities, such as handling more RAM, should boost performance in some settings when measured against current 32-bit servers. The company plans to pay particularly close attention to making a mark with four-processor servers based on the Opteron 800, its executives have said. "We're going to play a role in establishing a new price point in four-way servers. Right now there is a lot of distance between two-way and eight-way servers. AMD is going to create a new price performance category in the four-way space," Rob Herb, AMD's chief of sales and marketing, said in an interview with CNET News.com at the Opteron launch event in April. Because of Opteron's pricing, manufacturers will be able to build a four-processor server that will sell for less than $10,000, Herb said. That means a four-processor Opteron 800 server can be purchased for about $5,000 less than a current four-processor server, but only a couple of thousand dollars more than a top-of-the line two-processor server, he said. Related story Itanium breakthrough for Intel? "Madison" processor is Intel's best shot to take on IBM and Sun in the market for high-end server chips. The new Opterons also give AMD more ammunition with which to market its chips as alternatives to new 64-bit Itanium chips from rival Intel. AMD will tout the Opteron 200 and Opteron 800 as alternatives to Intel's latest Itanium and Xeon MP processors, which were also unveiled on Monday. The Opteron is priced lower than Itanium, but generally more than Xeon. So far, AMD has signed on several manufacturers, including IBM, to use Opteron in servers. IBM hasn't said exactly how many processors its new Opteron server will contain. At least three companies, including Appro International, Aspen Systems and RackSaver, are offering Opteron 800 servers now, according to AMD. Like the Opteron 200, which was designed for dual-processor servers, the Opteron 800 will be available in three models: the 840, 842 and 844. The first digit in the Opteron model number, 8, relates to the number of processors a server can expect to accommodate. The second two digits reflect performance. The model 842, for instance, is designed for a server with up eight processors and offers more performance than a model 840, but less than a model 844. The chip will offer similar performance to a model 242 chip for two-processor servers, however. Because the model numbers are similar, it's likely the Opteron 800 also runs at similar clock speeds to the Opteron 200, which came out in April at between 1.4GHz and 1.8GHz. The Opteron 100 for single-processor servers will also be available in three models: the 140, 142 and 144. Servers using the chip should begin shipping in July, AMD said. List prices for the Opteron 800 family start at $749 for the Opteron 840. The Opteron 842 lists for $1,299, and the Opteron 844 is $2,149. Prices for the Opteron 100 family range from $229 for the model 140 to $669 for the model 144.
2005-05-25 - AMD details Pacifica virtualization plan   Advanced Micro Devices has released full details of technology called Pacifica that will let computers run multiple operating systems more easily, an idea the computing industry is embracing enthusiastically. Much like a competing product from Intel, AMD's Pacifica will bring the technology called virtualization to server and desktop processors. Pacifica is due out in the first half of 2006. Virtualization, which breaks the tight coupling between hardware and software, enables software flexibility such as the capability of running multiple operating systems. That's useful for servers juggling multiple tasks and for desktop PCs divided into separate regions for personal, work and administrative uses, and a start-up called XenSource is hoping to capitalize on the idea. AMD began releasing some Pacifica details in March but published a PDF of the full specification Wednesday. AMD beat Intel to market with several significant features in x86 chips, including 64-bit memory support and a built-in memory controller. Intel has the edge when it comes to virtualization, however: Intel Virtualization Technology, previously code-named Vanderpool, is scheduled to arrive this year in Intel's desktop and Itanium processors. The primary software companies concerned with virtualization are those such as XenSource, Microsoft and EMC subsidiary VMware, all of which are working on software support for multiple operating systems. However, it's likely those companies will have to reckon with some differences between Pacifica and VT. "They're compatible in a lot of ways, but they are different," Illuminata analyst Gordon Haff said. "VMware or Microsoft, for example, will have to have slightly different implementations to handle the two different specifications." It's possible the specifications will converge, though, at least in areas where Intel and AMD don't see a competitive advantage, Haff added.
2002-06-03 - AMD demo hints Hammer in full swing    Advanced Micro Devices says Opteron, its forthcoming rival to Intel's Itanium 2 chip, is already catching on in the PC industry. AMD, which will introduce the processor early next year, demonstrated on Monday a four-way server built around a quartet of Opterons and announced a host of supporting software and components such as chipsets from Nvidia. The demo and news came at the Computex trade show in Taiwan. The four-way server and the new Opteron-friendly products are the latest milestones along AMD's road to introducing its Hammer family of processors. More than just another line of server and desktop chips, the Hammer family is the main focus of AMD's future ambitions. The Opteron will give AMD greater performance and will reduce manufacturing costs, the company said. These two features will help AMD continue to compete with bitter rival Intel. "Opteron, being (part of) AMD's next-generation product family, is critical to AMD's long-term presence in the market," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. The new Hammer chips will be capable of 2GHz and faster clock speeds and will be able to run 32-bit programs--the kind used on most desktops today--as well as 64-bit applications for servers. The Opteron chip will be aimed at servers, while another family member, an Athlon-branded chip formerly code-named ClawHammer, will debut first as a chip for desktop PCs. Monday's Opteron server demo used a 64-bit SuSE version of the Linux operating system and was meant to show off the processor's ability to work in midrange to high-end servers and compete with chips like Intel's Itanium 2. The announcements of supporting components and software, meanwhile, were designed to show that the industry is embracing the Opteron. Nvidia is developing a new version of its nForce chipset as well as both 32-bit and 64-bit software drivers that will work with Opteron and Athlon processors when they're released. Motherboard makers Asustek Computer, Elitegroup Computer Systems, First International Computer and Gigabyte Technology will all offer motherboards that support the new Hammer chips. Microsoft has even announced support for the new chips. It will create a version of its Windows operating system that is designed for use with Hammers. The new hardware components and software, as well as a host of other elements--ranging from 64-bit Linux to voltage regulators--are all needed to build and operate computers with the new AMD chips. Analysts say that while the announcements are fairly routine by themselves, the large number of them adds more evidence that the Hammer line is nearing completion. "There's been a lot of evidence the processors are ready to go. AMD has been demonstrating (Hammer) since last February," said Mercury Research's McCarron. "These are things you'd expect to happen before a product is launched." Hammer's 64-bit abilities will mainly be marketed on the Opteron or server side. That's because 64-bit chips can host much larger amounts of RAM than 32-bit machines, and larger applications like databases or computer simulations need the extra memory to perform well. Meanwhile, AMD's current Athlon XP processor for desktop and notebook PCs will continue to increase in speed and performance over the course of the year and undergo one more major revision before taking the place of both AMD's midrange and low-price chip offerings, starting early next year. The next Athlon XP chip, a 1.8GHz Athlon XP 2200+ desktop processor, will come next week, sources said. The 2200+ is AMD's first desktop chip to be manufactured by way of the .13 micron process, which should allow for higher clock speeds and lower power consumption. The next major upgrade after the 2200+, dubbed Barton, will add a larger 512KB on-chip data cache, which should boost performance by allowing the chip to access larger amounts of data quickly. Barton will come in the second half of this year. The company's low-price Duron chip is likely to see at least one more clock speed bump, to 1.4GHz, before being phased out at the end of the year.
2004-02-17 - AMD cuts prices power of Opteron chip  Advanced Micro Devices is adhering to the less-is-more theory as it begins shipments of low-power versions of its Opteron processor for servers. The Sunnyvale, Calif., chipmaker on Tuesday said it would begin shipping two low-power Opterons for blade servers, starting in mid-March. The announcement fulfills a promise the chipmaker made in September. In addition, AMD lowered the prices on a number of its existing Opteron models. AMD plans to offer two versions of the low-power processor, dubbed Opteron HE and Opteron EE. The HE chip, which consumes up to 55 watts of power, is the higher performer of the two. It will start out near the top of the company's model number system for ranking performance, with the HE 846, 246 and 146 models. The 30-watt EE chip will come in model numbers 840, 240 and 140, AMD said in a statement. By comparison, a standard Opteron, such as the 848, consumes as much as 89 watts, according to AMD's Web site. (The first digit in each of the model numbers depicts a chip's purpose or family, while the second two reflect its relative performance. A model 46, for example, should perform better than a model 44.) AMD designed the new Opterons for the growing market for blade servers. Heat and power consumption are major considerations for these smaller, more specialized devices, which are designed to be packed densely into racks. Increasing the diversity of the 64-bit-capable Opteron line stands to benefit AMD by fostering higher sales and a firmer foothold in the market. The processor has been available for almost a year, and several companies have begun or plan to begin offering it in their servers. Brand names IBM and Sun Microsystems are among them, while Hewlett-Packard is also expected to use the chip. Sun's first Opteron machine will be the dual-processor V20z. The Opteron, which is considered to be AMD's best effort to date to compete in the Intel-dominated server market, can run both 32-bit software, like most other Intel and AMD chips, and also more advanced 64-bit versions of the same software. When loaded with the proper 64-bit software, Opteron servers can handle far more memory and thus run applications such as databases or video-editing systems more efficiently than 32-bit servers. While AMD has about a year's head start in offering a 64-bit capable processor for inexpensive servers, it won't be alone in that market for long. Intel is expected to reveal a similar 64-bit chip technology this week at its Intel Developer Forum, and it already sells the 64-bit Itanium processor, though that chip typically comes in more-expensive servers. Besides launching the low-power chips, AMD cut list prices of its other Opterons this week. The chipmaker more than halved the price of its Opteron 848 chip, for example, lowering it from $3,199 to $1,514. The Opteron 846 chip was reduced by about 46 percent to $1,165, and model 844 dropped by about 33 percent to $873. AMD ratcheted the Opteron 842 down by about 30 percent to $698. Model 840 is also now priced at $698, a change of about 7 percent. The Opteron 800 family was designed for servers with four to eight or more processors. AMD also enacted price cuts for its Opteron 200 and 100 chip families, for dual- and single-processor servers and workstations. Many of the price adjustments were relatively small. The Opteron 248, for example, fell by about 7 percent to $851. The price on the Opteron 246 chip dropped to $690, a change of about 13 percent. The price of model 146 shrank by almost 37 percent to $278. The Opteron 144 fell about 25 percent to $218, while model 142 moved down about 22 percent to $178, and model 140 fell by about 13 percent to $163. Prices on Opteron 148, 244, 242 and 240 processors stayed the same at $733, $455, $316 and $198, respectively. AMD expects it will be able to command a premium for its low-power Opterons. It slotted its new chips into the upper reaches of each family's price range. Opteron 846 HE and 840 EE models list for $1,514 each. Opteron 246 HE and 240 EE models list for $851 each, and Opteron 146 HE and 140 EE models list for $733 each, AMD said. AMD's list prices assume that customers are purchasing chips in lots of 1,000. Street prices often vary from the company's list prices.
2009-06-18 - AMD Congo and the perils of code names Militias fighting over control of minerals used in electronic devices like mobile phones and laptops are systematically brutalizing and killing civilians in the the Congo. Mark Craemer When Advanced Micro Devices came up with the name of "Congo" for its new dual-core chip targeting ultra-thin devices executives were thinking of the river in Africa, following the company's practice of naming mobile projects after rivers. But some bloggers who monitor humanitarian crises and conflicts in Africa blasted the chipmaker for using the name of a country where civilians are dying and brutalized in a conflict over natural resources like tin, tungsten, and coltan that end up in electronics equipment like computers and mobile phones. The Congo is "the place where trade in minerals vital to technology like ultra-thin laptops is fueling the deadliest conflict in the world," writes David Sullivan on his Enough blog. The site has named the African country the most dangerous place in the world to be a female because of the epidemic of sexual violence that has been going on there for years. A post on the Congo Resources blog says: "Nicknaming their product after the Congo--well, that takes chutzpah." The cause was also taken up by a Daily Kos blogger who sent a letter of complaint to AMD Chief Executive Dirk Meyer last week. Contacted for comment this week, AMD spokesman John Taylor said the company "truly regrets" causing any offense, even unintentionally. "It was an oversight not to see that (the code name) could be viewed in an entirely different context," he said. AMD began using the name "2nd Generation Ultrathin Platform" instead of Congo as part of a natural pre-launch naming transition, Taylor said. "The Daily Kos blog helped finalize and expedite a process that was already in motion," he added. "We're striving for that codename to be retired." This isn't the first time a tech company has been bitten by a product name. In 2003, Intel was forced to change the code name of a planned Itanium chip from Tanglewood to Tukwila to avoid a trademark dispute with the Tanglewood Music Center in Massachusetts. Microsoft ran into problems with the name of its new search engine, Bing, in China after finding out that the word has several meanings in Mandarin, including "to be ill." As a result, the Chinese version of Bing has been named "biying," which means "must respond," according to The Wall Street Journal. In 1994, Apple had a notorious dispute with Carl Sagan after he complained about Apple code-naming the Power Macintosh 7100 after him. Apple changed the code name first to "Butt-Head Astronomer" and then "LAW" for "Lawyers Are Wimps" before settling a libel lawsuit with the famous astronomer, according to The Mac Observer. And then, of course, there is the trouble Apple got in over the company name itself. Apple Inc. and Apple Corps Ltd., the record label started by the The Beatles in 1968, finally reached an agreement in 2007 to settle their trademark dispute. Update 8:25 p.m. PST:Taylor later added that "AMD has been a member of the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) since 2006. As part of our supply chain management process, we set expectations annually with our top tier suppliers regarding adherence to our Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct and the EICC Code of Conduct. We are actively monitoring the conflict minerals issue as well as proposed legislation in the U.S. Congress. The EICC is currently researching the extractive metals supply chain (specifically tin, tantalum, and cobalt) as it relates to the electronics industry. We will continue to monitor this relevant issue and its potential effects."

2006-01-26 - Allies pledge 10 billion to boost Itanium  SAN FRANCISCO--Intel, Hewlett-Packard and seven other server companies will spend $10 billion through 2010 to try to increase adoption of the Itanium processor. The money is coming from Intel and HP--Itanium's co-developers and top backers--as well as from Unisys, Silicon Graphics Inc., NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Fujitsu-Siemens and Groupe Bull. The companies said Thursday that they will spend the money on research and development, marketing, and work to help software companies support the high-end processor. "Itanium has been taking share from both IBM power and Sun Sparc. We're on the right trajectory, but we want to go faster," Tom Kilroy, general manager of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group, said at a press event here. "The $10 billion investment is a statement that we want to accelerate as a unified body." The companies are members of the Itanium Solutions Alliance, which includes Microsoft, Red Hat, Novell, Oracle and other software companies. The alliance also announced its Itanium Solutions Catalog, which describes various combinations of hardware and software for specific tasks. Itanium, a high-end processor, was once expected to sweep the server world. But because of delays, initial performance issues and software incompatibilities, Intel has had major difficulties getting Itanium to catch on. Most recently, the first dual-core model, code-named Montecito, was delayed from 2005 until mid-2006. Kilroy made it clear why Intel is pushing so hard to give Itanium a stronger future. "This is a $140 billion opportunity on hardware. It's dwarfed by the opportunity in software and services on top of that," Kilroy said. "There's a reason there's $10 billion of investment in play." SGI, a relatively small company that concentrates on the high-end technical computing systems, expects to benefit from the strength-in-numbers argument behind the alliance. "The Itanium Solutions Alliance is useful for us," said Greg Estes, vice president of global marketing, in an interview. "If you're a company like ours, you try to stake out ground to be the high-performance player in the marketplace. If you can do that with a robust ecosystem underneath that, that doesn't feel esoteric--high-performance systems with something that feels like it has some weight on it so you're not just betting on SGI alone--that's a better story for customers."
2006-02-02 - Alliance aims to drive Itanium in Asia Spurred by the growth of the Intel Itanium processor in the region, the Asian arm of the Itanium Solutions Alliance (ISA) is confident of securing a fair share of the $10 billion recently pledged by group members. William Wu, who chairs the ISA Asia-Pacific committee formed late last year, said the alliance has not determined how much of the new funds will be made available to Asia-Pacific. But he said he is confident the region will be allocated "a fair share," thanks to the rapid growth of the Itanium processor in China, India and Japan. Wu is also Intel Asia's regional marketing manager of server platforms. The ISA aims to provide resources to help programmers write and optimize software for Itanium-based systems. Citing figures from research company IDC, Wu said that Itanium's market share in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan, more than doubled from 4 percent in the third quarter of 2004, to 9 percent during the same quarter last year. In Japan, the Itanium processor has an even bigger footprint, he said. Wu added that Itanium server revenues outgrew IBM's and Sun Microsystems' server revenues by 60 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in the third quarter of 2005. The success of the Intel chip in Japan is further underscored by the strong Japanese contingent in ISA, which includes members Hitachi, Fujitsu and NEC, he added. However, Itanium shipment numbers have not been impressive, compared to figures from competing chips. According to research company Gartner, 7,845 Itanium-based servers were shipped worldwide during the third quarter of last year. That number pales in comparison to 62,776 machines with Sun's UltraSparc and 31,648 with IBM's Power chip shipped over the same quarter. Asked if part of the problem could have stemmed from Itanium's early hiccups, Vish Mulchand, business development director for enterprise storage and servers at Hewlett-Packard (HP) Asia-Pacific, acknowledged the issues could have been a factor. HP is the co-developer of the Itanium processor. Intel has had to deal with a delayed road map, as well as performance issues. But Mulchand noted that road map delays are common in the industry, citing product delays in Microsoft's Windows Vista and Sun's servers. He added that Intel has since fixed performance issues with Itanium 2. Once touted as the chip that would grab market share from the x86 platform, Itanium has been repositioned for high-end computing tasks undertaken by data centers and business intelligence systems, rather than low-end servers. This was evident when Intel scrapped on-chip support for x86 codes, opting for software emulation to run x86 software on Itanium. Rajnish Arora, associate director for IDC Asia-Pacific, said: "Intel's commitment to Itanium, in terms of sustained technology investments and strong execution of its marketing strategy, has underpinned the platform's rapid adoption across the Asia-Pacific region in recent quarters." "An improving performance, multi-operating system capability and strong ISV (independent software vendor) momentum have been pivotal in fueling its rapid acceptance in the enterprise space," he said. Last month, the ISA announced that 6,000 applications have been written for Itanium-based systems, Wu said. Of the ISVs that currently contribute to the platform's software pool, about 300 are from the Asia-Pacific region, he said, adding that plans are underway to conduct Itanium developer workshops in Asia this year. Wu noted that China and India, apart from Japan, have been earmarked as growth markets for Itanium due to the lack of legacy systems in both countries. This helps to drive adoption because companies do not have to worry about system migration, he said. To drive the adoption of Itanium in the region, Wu said five Itanium Solution Centers were set up in Bangalore, Shanghai and Singapore over the last three years. These centers are charged with helping businesses migrate to Itanium and offer services such as application testing. Aaron Tan reported from Singapore for ZDNet Asia.
2004-04-22 - A year old Opteron serves notice   With its Opteron server chip, underdog Advanced Micro Devices appears to have finally bet on a winner. Since introducing the 64-bit processor a year ago Thursday, AMD has been granted new access to the major server makers, seen its red ink turn to black and even managed to get powerful Intel to rethink its own product plans. News.context What's new: Since introducing the 64-bit processor a year ago, AMD has been granted new access to the major server makers, seen its red ink turn to black and even managed to get powerful Intel to rethink its own product plans. Bottom line: Opteron sales are still far behind those of Intel's competing Xeon chip, but they've enabled AMD to post profits for its two most recent quarters. And because the server market moves slowly, letting companies build stable customer bases, continued success for the server-centric Opteron could help AMD better weather the volatile PC chip market. More stories on this topic "Opteron was AMD's ticket to tier one," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst with Mercury Research. "It gave AMD the advantage it needed to break into servers, the most difficult technology market. In addition it helped AMD's bottom line." Though Opteron sales still lag those of Intel's competing Xeon chip by a wide margin, the accomplishments aren't small ones for AMD--especially considering the gamble the company took when starting down a path not already paved by Microsoft. Working with Hewlett-Packard, Intel spent years developing its 64-bit Itanium server chip. AMD, meanwhile, decided to tweak the x86 architecture, the underpinnings of all PC processors, believing that "="" data-asset-type="article" data-uuid="cd52255e-fedd-11e4-bddd-d4ae52e62bcc" data-slug="a-payoff-on-amds-64-bit-bet" data-link-text="new chip-to-chip data connection"> called Hypertransport. But Opteron had momentum right out of the gate. IBM immediately said it would offer the chip in one of its servers, and not long after, Sun Microsystems and HP also announced plans to offer Opteron servers, giving AMD three of the world's four top server manufacturers. A range of customers from corporations to universities have begun installing Opteron servers for use in their business processes, product development and research. AMD even got Intel's attention. Earlier this year, Intel said it would deliver a 64-bit capable x86 chip of its own. The first version of that chip, a 64-bit capable Xeon processor dubbed Nocona, will come out later this year and be capable of running 32-bit software. A recent analysis by the Microprocessor Report concluded that Intel used AMD's published design specifications and examples of its 64-bit chips to help develop the Nocona line. An Intel spokesman said Nocona was designed to be compatible with x86 and Microsoft's 64-bit Windows, thus making the chips look very similar. Most server makers, including IBM, will offer Nocona servers alongside their Opteron machines. Feeling chipper Since its introduction, Opteron has also helped bolster AMD's finances. Unprofitable since the second quarter of 2001, the chipmaker posted earnings for its two most recent quarters. And during the last quarter, AMD's average selling price for a processor also rose, likely as a result of Opteron, because server chips sell for higher prices than desktop processors. "A very modest contribution of unit volumes for server products has a very significant impact on bottom line revenue and profit," McCarron said. AMD knows it's got a good thing going. "We've been pretty confident that the approach we've been taking to 64 bits is the right one...but the rate at which we've seen tier one OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) such as HP, IBM and Sun sign up exceeded our plans," said Dirk Meyer, senior vice president of AMD's Computational Products Group. The server space is notoriously conservative when it comes to adopting new products. Meyer said he believes Opteron's initial success was because of pent-up demand from companies that were looking for servers that would offer a relatively inexpensive migration path to 64-bit software. As far back as the mid-1990s, "we got visits from people in the technical communities, (and) from global tier-one OEMs begging us to do a 64-bit extension to the x86, because they saw it as something that their customers wanted," Meyer said. "It might be interesting...to know that even way back then, this is something we developed more as a pull from customers, instead of a push." So far, AMD has shipped about 150,000 Opterons, mainly in two-processor servers, McCarron said. That's about half of all AMD's server chips during the year. Intel shipped about 6 million Xeon chips during the same time frame, he said. Although it's present in a relatively small number of servers, Opteron has had a disproportionate effect on the server market as a whole. By prompting Intel to divulge its Nocona plans, Opteron essentially allowed AMD to set the agenda for the server industry, something it has not done before, McCarron said. "I am sure (AMD executives) would prefer their unit volumes would be higher, but to make that much progress in a year certainly qualifies as an achievement," McCarron said. Clusters of success Many computer users in the scientific community have chosen Opteron because of its price and performance, said Mason Katz, group leader for cluster development at Rocks Cluster, a division of the San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California, San Diego. A little more than 6 percent of Rocks Cluster software customers use Opteron. That number may double by the end of the year, he said. "We're seeing people buying Opteron clusters for about the same price as an Intel (Xeon) cluster, and basically for free they get 64-bit addressing (from Opteron) if they need it," Katz said. "What sets Opteron apart from other AMD server chips is that AMD is doing a better job of partnering with first- and second-tier vendors. The fact that you can go to someone like Sun (for Opteron servers)...is what truly makes it competitive with (Intel). AMD has finally figured out how to get into the top-tier vendors. It looks like Opteron is here to stay...which is really good news for everyone." Opteron's continued success could also have a stabilizing effect on AMD. Because the server market moves slowly, it allows companies to build stable customer bases. Continued success in servers would help AMD better weather the volatile PC chip market, McCarron said. Most of AMD's progress has been in single- and dual-processor Opteron servers used in computing clusters, or collections of computers strung together to create supercomputerlike performance. AMD and partners such as HP and Sun are testing the market for four- and eight-processor servers, which are more likely to be used by businesses to handle critical computing tasks, such as running databases. This week, HP launched its four-processor Opteron server; Sun's is still in the works. AMD already has made a number of moves, such as the development of Hypertransport, to foster the development of four- and eight-processor servers with Opteron. It has also dropped prices of Opteron Model 800 chips. Four-processor Opteron servers are appealing to Sun, said Souheil Saliba, Sun's vice president of marketing and strategy. "When we announced the fact that we were going with Opteron, we announced it was going to go anywhere and everywhere," he said. "We decided very early on we were not going to put shackles on ourselves." Sun plans four- and eight-processor Opteron servers as well as server blades using the chip. "The nature of our relationship...is such that I am able to go back to (AMD) and say, 'What if? Have you considered doing this?'" Saliba said. "The good news...is they're all ears." As for the next few years, the 64-bit debate on the desktop looms. Intel won't likely bring its 32/64-bit chips to desktops and notebooks until Microsoft's update to Windows is released. Code-named Longhorn, the operating system is not expected until the first half of 2006. By contrast, AMD says 64 bits on the desktop will start to gain popularity, at least with gamers, soon after Microsoft releases its first 64-bit version of Windows, due at the end of this year. Analysts, however, have said AMD could be a bit optimistic. Few 64-bit applications exist and memory prices are on the rise. One of the key features of 64-bit chips is that they can handle more than 4GB of memory, but memory prices are on the rise. Today, 4GB of DDR memory costs around $800 or more at retail, more than many complete PCs. Typically, memory constitutes only 8 percent of a PC's component costs, according to PC executives and analysts.

2005-05-04 - 911 calls HP   Hewlett-Packard has managed to convince communications company Intrado, which serves as the backbone of the nation's 911 network, to commit to using HP's lineup of Integrity servers as it upgrades the network. The HP technology, which previously has been slow to catch on in the marketplace, eventually will replace IBM servers currently used in the network. Intrado said Wednesday it will go "HP only" during an upgrade to accommodate the growing numbers of customers using new technologies such as voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, a software that lets Internet connections double as phone lines. Next-generation 911 services will also make better use of cell phone cameras by allowing callers to send uploaded images to dispatchers, the company said. HP's success in converting one of its partners to Integrity, a server lineup based on the Itanium processor that runs the HP-UX version of Unix, is good news for the company. HP, which deferred to Intrado for comments on the deal, and chipmaker Intel have had a hard time attracting customers for Itanium-based products. HP is also partway through a year-long cancellation of two Unix server lines, its own HP 9000 products based on PA-RISC chips and the AlphaServer products it acquired from Compaq. HP's deal with Intrado has some impact on IBM, whose equipment Intrado installed in about 50 percent of the emergency dispatch centers it serves. Big Blue is no longer a "go forward" choice, according to Intrado Chief Technology Officer Stephen Meer. HP servers, now deployed in the other half of the network, will replace IBM equipment once that equipment wears out, and HP servers will be used to outfit any new customers, according to Meer. By choosing just one company, "there's no ambiguity on our technology path going forward," Meer said. Police and other agencies running the nation's emergency call centers have said that Intrado's mix of server technologies increased the price of doing business and made servicing the system more complicated for emergency call-center IT staffs. As a consequence, decisions to upgrade the system stalled, reducing chances of a speedy overhaul of the nation's creaking 911 network, Meer said. "Entrado's decision to use HP's servers does not have any impact on IBM," IBM spokesman Jim Larkin said.
2004-08-02 - 64-bit Intel server onslaught begins   Hewlett-Packard, Dell, IBM and others announced on Monday the first servers to use Intel Xeon processors augmented with 64-bit extensions, a technology with major long-term implications. The 3.6GHz chip, code-named Nocona, is used in increasingly powerful dual-processor machines that account for the bulk of Intel's presence in the market for servers. The systems are part of a new 64-bit era begun by Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices, an era that makes it easier to support more than 4GB of memory on the companies' "x86" chips. Though Intel launched the 64-bit Itanium family in 2001, it wasn't practical to run the vast number of applications written for x86 chips such as Pentium and Xeon. Intel stands by its long-term Itanium plans, arguing that Itanium servers will have the same price but twice the performance as Xeon machines by 2007, but market analyst company IDC lowered its Itanium forecasts based on the arrival of 64-bit x86 chips. The new chips range in speed from 3.6GHz to 2.8GHz and can be coupled with two different chipsets: the 7520, formerly code-named Lindenhurst, for more performance-minded servers; and the 7320, for assembling less-expensive models. Intel also released a chip called the IOP 332 for pulling data out of storage networks. The processor is based on a design from ARM, as are many other Intel networking chips. As expected, the Nocona systems have arrived at same time as the LinuxWorld Conference & Expo in San Francisco--appropriate timing given that Linux is the only operating system so far that can take advantage of the processor's 64-bit extensions. Microsoft in July delayed its 64-bit version of Windows for x86 chips such as Intel's Xeon and AMD's Opteron. Transitions from 32-bit to 64-bit chips, however, take years to accomplish, as chips, operating systems and eventually software are adapted to the change. The transition doesn't have to be fast, though; Xeon and Opteron can run 64-bit and 32-bit programs simultaneously. "This gives (customers) the flexibility to deploy systems now and migrate when their 64-bit applications are ready," said Bruce Kornfeld, director of Dell's worldwide enterprise marketing. The Nocona servers also come with other technologies--notably, faster DDR2 (double data rate 2) memory and the PCI Express interface for input-output devices such as network and storage cards. To use these technologies, the systems employ a faster 800MHz front-side bus to connect the Xeon to the rest of the system. Additionally, the Xeon processors feature a technology called Demand Based Switching, which saves energy by slowing the chip down between tasks. It came from the company's notebook division, said Abhi Talwalkar, general manager of Intel's Enterprise Platform Group. However, because of a glitch in the Lindenhurst chipset, Intel recommends against using PCI Express plug-in cards. The problem is expected to be fixed in the fourth quarter, but in the meantime, the existing older PCI-X interface can be used. Talwalkar said the glitch could cause a system to suspend operations, if it is hit with a large number of input-output requests. The problem apparently is rare; it came up during stress testing in situations that would not likely come up in a server room. Still, Intel will rework the chips and issue a new version. "This year, Intel has had its share of execution challenges," Talwalkar said. "It (the glitch) results in a system hang because an I/O system is asking for system resources." Among the new Xeon servers announced on Monday are the following: Dell has released four models: the stand-alone 1800 and 2800 and the rack-mountable PowerEdge 1850 and 2850. The 1850 is 1.75 inches thick (1 rack unit, or 1U), while the 2850, with more storage space, is 3.5 inches (2U). A low-end 1850s and 2850s with a 2.8GHz processor and 512MB of memory but no operating system cost $1,799 and $1,899, respectively. IBM has two rack-mounted versions, also 1U and 2U thick, as well as a thin blade server, two stand-alone servers and a workstation. The 1U accommodates four hard drives and as much as 16GB of memory and has a $2,209 starting price, while the 2U x346 can accommodate up to six drives and 16GB of memory and has a $2,239 starting price. And the upgraded HS20 blade server starts at $3,559 for two processors and 2GB of memory. HP, the No. 1 seller of Intel-based servers, also has 1U and 2U rack-mounted models, the ProLiant DL360 G4 and DL380 G4, respectively. Starting prices are $2,349 and $3,449 for the models. Stand-alone ML350 G4 and ML370 G4 servers, with starting prices of $1,529 and $2,899, also will be joined by an updated blade server, the BL20p, whose price will be announced when it ships Sept. 1. Tatung Science & Technology is releasing new rack-mounted machines for hosting Internet games, business software and scientific applications. Other companies supporting the new dual-processor products include Acer, Appro, California Digital, Fujitsu, Gateway, Hitachi, Kraftway, LanChao, Lenovo, LinuxNetworx, NEC, Quanta, Rackable Systems, SuperMicro, Toshiba, Verari and Wistron.

2010-01-12 - 2010 will be a wild ride for IT    This year is going to be amazingly full of change in IT. "Ennnh, IT sees a lot of change every year," you say? Yes, fine and true. But not like this one. Not at this magnitude. Consider: Virtualization is being taken up at such a pace that it's hard to find a metaphor to describe it. "Exploding" has a pieces-coming-apart-at-high-speed vibe, when in fact virtualization's pieces are all coming together. "Imploding" doesn't work either. We've had maybe five years of fast growth, but now it's mainstream and ready for the lion's share of apps. We've passed the point where the natural expectation for new servers is that they may be virtualized. The best default assumption now is that they will be virtualized. Yes, there are still exceptions, but they're quickly growing fewer and further between. Whereas five years ago, many IT managers were still routinely skeptical about virtualizing production workloads, for most it's now just a matter of when and how, not if. Beyond the straightforward consolidation and infrastructure rationalization that powered virtualization's first wave of mainstream adoption, in 2010 many data centers will be well into their second wave. Many others will be entering it. In recent discussions, CIOs have routinely lauded the ability to leverage virtualization into high-value attributes like high availability and disaster tolerance. Recent improvements in both processors and virtualization software are bringing in use cases previously considered "hard to virtualize"-for example, communications and database servers. And those have already virtualized their servers will now start virtualizing their desktops. Millions of desktops are in need of updating, especially those that skipped Windows Vista. In rolling out Windows 7, IT departments will ask themselves whether they really want to get into yet another round of distributed management. Desktop virtualization technology is now far superior to what was available just three years back; it will see significant new uptake among large enterprises. Cloud and as-a-service computing Cloud computing, in all of its X as a Service forms (where X = software, infrastructure, platform, storage, or whathaveyou), is not the way a majority of IT will be done this year, or next, or the one after that. But don't let its definitional and standards battles, ornery nay-sayers, or "seems interesting, but we're not exactly sure how we'll use it" status fool you. That's exactly where virtualization was, just five years ago. These "early days" issues will work themselves out in short order. Software as a Service has already gone mainstream, with many well-known examples such as Salesforce.com, Google Apps, and Zoho. The infrastructure and platform-as-a-service senses of cloud are less widely accepted, but only for now. They too have enthusiastic customers. Cloud is the way that start-ups now allocate a lot of their IT infrastructure, rather than building their own data centers. That approach will seep into enterprises as well, gradually at first, but gaining steam. Beyond the usual poster kid providers-Amazon Web Services, GoGrid, Google, Rackspace, and Terremark-Microsoft has arrived with Azure for developers; so too have IBM, HP, and others for specific use cases such as testing. Whereas virtualization simplifies and improves the computing resources that you have to provide, cloud computing radically simplifies by having someone else provide resources and capabilities as an on-demand service. Given the economic advantages of a centralized, network-delivered service, cloud will mature and grow rapidly. New Processors: Intel has already gotten off the mark with over two dozen new CPU SKUs. At 32nm. Didn't we just go through the whole 45nm roll-out? Not literally, but it sure seems like it-and yet here were are, getting a full wave of the next fabrication generation. Oh, you wanted server rather than desktop/laptop chips? The much-updated "Nehalem" generation of 2009 not quite enough? Ok, the 8-core, multi-threaded "Nehalem-EX" is just around the corner. Its design for performance, I/O, virtualization, and availability enters it seriously into the Big Iron battle among scale-up architectures. Intel's also going to get the next generation ("Tukwila") of its Even Bigger Iron processor, Itanium, out the door. Not to be outdone, IBM's POWER7 generation is expected this year, complete with it's own raft of Wow! feeds, speeds, and specifications. Oh, yeah, a new z11 mainframe generation is rumored. Did I miss anyone? Probably. New Systems: Where there are new processor generations, new system generations are right behind. Dell, HP, IBM, Sun, and everyone else in the x86 server market is going to offer a way to get Nehalem-EX into the hands of virtualization-hungry data centers. HP will naturally have new Itanium-based servers driven by Tukwila, as may Itanium's other supporters. IBM's definitely going to have a new generation of Power Systems sporting POWER7, and a new System z for the z11 processor. Long story short, the market's going to be awash in amazingly powerful, many-core, many-thread, virtualization- and workload-optimized systems. In 2010, it will be rare to get a new system product briefing and think "yeah yeah, a minor, incremental update." All the vendors are aiming for "Wow! That's amazing! I want one! I mean...I want a lot of 'em!" Oh, and those are just compute elements. I didn't yet mention the wholesale shift in storage toward highly intelligent, highly virtualized arrays, or the revolution that Flash-based solid state disks (SSDs) have become. Nor have we talked about the rapid convergence of servers, storage, and networking. Oh, well. No time now. New Vendors: IT vendors are rapidly consolidating and verticalizing their operations. Who sells what, to whom, is much in flux. For example, Cisco Systems doesn't just sell networking; it also sells servers and collaboration tools. Oracle will be a server and storage company, in addition to applications and middleware. EMC has been transforming into a management and security company, in addition to the storage and information management it previously provided. IBM and HP are nearly everything companies; their ongoing stream of acquisitions makes them even-more-of-everything companies. Dell is adding major in-house services. Microsoft's adding a cloud. Oh, yeah, Amazon and Google are becoming IT providers. Fancy that. VMware has become a tier-one platform and management company. On and on. If the vendors themselves are not new, their position in the market and their ambitions certainly are. New Applications: Every few years, a new class of applications comes on-line. The historical ERP and CRM waves are good examples. Social networks, mobile everything, and pervasive computing are current examples. Social networks just a consumer/personal thing, you say? Then why am I being briefed on system management tools integrated with Twitter? Mobile everything has been a decade coming but continues to accelerate as the devices--whether iPhone, BlackBerry, Palm Pre, Android, Windows Mobile, or all the rest--become smarter and cheaper, and as mobile broadband infrastructure improves. Finally, pervasive computing--the idea of sensors and actuators spread throughout our homes, stores, cars, roads, buildings, factories, and other places, all intelligently coordinated--has been coming (slowly) for a decade. But the technology of RFID, digital surveillance, wide-area and mesh networks, and intelligent sensors have greatly matured, causing organizations to consider new opportunities for optimizing complex macro-systems like roadways, supply chains, and power grids. IBM's "Smarter Planet" phrasing nicely captures this. I've really just brushed the surface of the changes that are rapidly occurring in IT. None are ex nihilo new; instead they accelerate and deepen technologies, trends, and initiatives that IT's been working on for some time. A combination of product cycle timing and economic downturn dampened the pace of 2008 and 2009. This year benefits. It's going to be a wild ride, with everything bursting forth. Should we call that riding the tiger? Riding a rocket sled? Whatever metaphor you prefer, hang on tight. This year is going to be a fast, aggressive--and fun--ride.
2001-02-22 - "McKinley" set to star at Intel conference Intel has completed the design of its "McKinley" processor for servers, according to sources--a manufacturing milestone that will likely be one of the highlights of the Intel Developer Forum next week. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker has "taped out," or completed, the blueprint on McKinley, a code name for a 64-bit processor for high-end servers, according to sources close to the company. Intel has also managed to run some software on the existing samples. Although McKinley won't appear in servers until 2002, the news that the design is finished will likely be one of the focal points of the Intel Developer Forum, a three-day conference on all things Intel, starting Tuesday in San Jose, Calif. Among other highlights, Intel and executives from BeComm, which makes media applications for Internet appliances, will show off a prototype of an Intel-branded Web-surfing pad. Intel will also likely update the Pentium 4 road map and discuss plans to better couple Pentium 4 computers with double data rate DRAM. In a direct swipe at rival Transmeta, Intel will also introduce proposals for a new benchmark testing system for comparing energy-efficient notebook chips, according to the conference agenda. Server developments, though, will likely take center stage. For years, Intel has been aggressively trying to come out with a processor that can compete against expensive and ornate chips like Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc III or Compaq Computer's Alpha. These chips process data in 64-bit chunks, as opposed to most Intel chips, which digest data at a 32-bit rate. Despite a focus on McKinley, the Itanium chip will actually be Intel's first member of the IA-64 family. But successive delays, among other factors, have stripped that chip of much of its potential. Originally due in 1999, the chip won't be available commercially until May. However, the majority of server manufacturers aren't designing or manufacturing their own Itanium servers; most will sell Itanium servers designed by Intel and said they will wait for McKinley before investing heavily into IA-64. "McKinley is really the vehicle that is going to begin the volume ramp for IA-64," said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64. Compaq, for instance, will release a 32-processor server based on McKinley next year, according to Mary McDowell, general manger of the industry standard server group at Compaq. By contrast, Itanium is already relegated to the nostalgia market. Brookwood recalled one conference where the company trotted out the president of dying dot-com eToys to extol the virtues of Itanium for its e-commerce needs. "He was saying how they needed more capacity," Brookwood laughed. "eToys probably isn't pushing them for delivery anymore." Earlier this month, the online toy retailer announced it expects to shut down in April. Along with these two chips, Intel will also likely discuss "Foster," a code name for a version of the Pentium 4 for servers due out in May. The chip will be part of the Xeon family. Memory will likely be another hot topic. Although the Pentium 4 currently works only with Rambus memory, Intel has already said it will come out with a "Brookdale" chipset that allows PC makers to couple the chip with DDR DRAM. The question now is when Brookdale will come out. A DDR version of Brookdale is slated for the first quarter of 2002. Other companies, though, such as Acer Labs, are expected to release Pentium 4 chipsets for DDR DRAM this year. Some industry watchers believe Intel may move up the release date. A panel discussing the memory road map will take place Tuesday afternoon. Analysts say the megahertz race, or lack thereof, will also likely be a topic of conversation. Last year, Intel and rival Advanced Micro Devices were engaged in a fierce battle to have the fastest chip on the planet. A slowdown in PC demand has taken some of the fire out of the race. Ultimately, this could slow the pace of chip acceleration. "The market is so soft right now that no one is asking for a refresh of components," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. As it did at the last conference, Intel will use the event to promote peer-to-peer computing. Andrew Chien, one of the founders of Entropia, one of the leading P2P start-ups, will speak on Wednesday.
