Title:
2002-01-02 - Commentary Strong vendor strong challenges

Article:
By Martin Reynolds, Gartner Analyst Intel has worked hard to expand its business in areas such as servers, networking and wireless, but the desktop remains the company's most crucial battlefield. Intel always has a spread of new products visible through the medium term as it enhances and upgrades its processors. The introduction of Itanium is a key initiative, and Tualatin is important, too. But Intel's current challenge is moving the Pentium 4 into the IT mainstream as the Pentium III processor reaches the end of its planned life cycle on the desktop. Gartner sees this challenge as one of convincing IT managers that the Pentium 4 platform can deliver long-term buying stability without the marketing challenges of the current Rambus designs. Gartner believes that Intel's next-generation chipset, if properly positioned and managed, can deliver on this requirement and looks forward to Intel's exposition of its road map. On the broader front, Intel faces its toughest competition ever from Advanced Micro Devices and is caught in the jaws of a slowing market, where lower prices are required to drive growth. The bottom line is that Intel faces some of its toughest challenges since the dog days of the 286 processor, and it needs to marshal all of its resources to grow its business. See news story: Intel makes strides with Tualatin chips One of its largest initiatives is its Macroprocessing campaign--the application of low-cost, high-performance technology to computing on a grand scale. Intel believes that Macroprocessing can open up a whole new realm of information technology that would allow managers to understand their businesses in more detail and in a more timely fashion than ever before. Gartner believes that investment in real-time business management will be a key strategic initiative for enterprises, and Intel's intent is to make Macroprocessing a foundation technology in pursuit of this goal.

2002-01-02 - SuSE rolls ahead despite Linux shakeout

Article:
July 24, 2000, Dirk Hohndel SuSE rolls ahead despite Linux shakeout By Stephen Shankland Staff Writer, CNET NEWS.COM Wall Street may be cautious on Linux these days, but that's not discouraging Dirk Hohndel, chief technology officer of German software and services firm SuSE. "Yes, we are planning a public offering," Hohndel said in an interview with CNET News.com. Though he declined to offer further details, such as when the IPO might take place, SuSE spokesman Carter Kohlmeyer said in an earlier interview that an offering likely would be structured to take advantage of stock markets in both the United States and Europe. The move is bold, given the troubles experienced by support firm Linuxcare, layoffs at TurboLinux and the overall cooling trend affecting Linux firms. Although SuSE wasn't profitable last year, it was in 1998 and garnered a substantial $21.4 million in revenue for 1999. SuSE is one of the traditional Linux companies, like Red Hat, TurboLinux and Caldera Systems, selling a version of the freely available and cooperatively developed operating system. SuSE, with 460 employees, is one of the top four companies, according to market researcher International Data Corp. Linux, though once a Wall Street darling, hasn't proved to be a panacea for the troubles of SGI, Santa Cruz Operation or Corel, each of which has seen its stock price plummet despite announcing major Linux initiatives. A clone of Unix and a competitor with Windows, Linux has passed through the difficult stage of winning respect from major computer sellers such as Hewlett-Packard, Dell Computer, IBM and Compaq Computer. But investors now are more demanding. Linux companies are no longer assumed to be an easy path to riches, and most of the new crop of Linux companies focus on specialty areas such as cramming Linux into tiny devices or making it suitable for crash-proof servers. Not SuSE. In an interview with News.com, Hohndel described his company's plans for making money the old-fashioned open-source way, selling service and support. Selling services for free software has been widely espoused in the open-source world, but while SuSE and Red Hat embraced it, Caldera Systems and TurboLinux opted for other strategies. CNET News.com: How is SuSE different from other Linux companies? Hohndel: The key point is what you are offering. We see ourselves as one of the leading technology providers, with a strong focus on our customer needs. In practice, that's obvious, but we have key differentiating factors. You need to have a very big development staff actively involved in the open-source community. You can't simply sit there and wait for the open-source community to do something. You need staff with in-depth knowledge in order to provide excellent service and support. We see Linux as the future operating system in the server space and a very strong contender in the desktop space...It's not just the operating system, it's the services and support you're able to offer around them. Some people have said that since the departure of Marc Torres to Atipa Linux Solutions, your management in the U.S. market has been weak. I don't think we're weak in the U.S. at all. We have very enthusiastic customers (such as) Oracle and SGI. Of course, there's always room for improvement, and we are actively trying to improve our market communication. If you are the first company to arrive and you don't provide the service you promise, you aren't going to succeed. What are SuSE's revenues? We (were) profitable in 1998. We started very aggressive growth in late 1998. Aggressive growth obviously means that your revenues are somewhat behind your growth on your cost side. We currently are not profitable, but we are optimistic to become so again. Our revenue was 23 million euros ($21.4 million) in 1999. How serious are you about the services business? Obviously we are very serious about this. Services is one of the key business areas for SuSE. No one actually buys an operating system in a commercial environment. People in a company are looking for solutions, and an operating system is a tool to provide a solution and nothing more. Without providing services, there is not much point in addressing a commercial market. We're rolling out services on a global basis...using a staged approach. Usually we start new services in the German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), which is our home area. The next step is the United States, further to the rest of Europe, and then the rest of the world. So you now offer around-the-clock support? You can purchase 7-by-24 support in German-speaking countries. You can purchase contracts...depending on the response times you need. The categories of support are silver, gold and platinum. Silver costs 4,200 euros ($3,900) per year. Platinum costs 36,800 euros ($34,200) per year, with a one-hour response time. Is there any competition for Linux services in Europe? At this point, there is no real competition. I expect established hardware vendors like Hewlett-Packard or IBM are going to offer similar services at some point, and I expect some other Linux players are going to do that. What about services in the United States? We have professional services out of our Oakland (Calif.) office for things like consulting and implementation. There are half a dozen people who are exclusively working in consulting and professional services and have another dozen working in areas of support and engineering. How hard is it to hire Linux personnel? Linux is a very, very hot topic. A lot of people like to work in the Linux industry, so hiring people is easy compared to traditional business. But Silicon Valley is an extremely competitive job market. What's SuSE's position with helping open-source programming efforts, in particular the XFree86 project for a Linux graphical user interface? The desktop is a very important area for Linux. Ignoring the desktop is one of the major mistakes the Unix vendors did in the Unix wars. We are investing a lot both in sponsorships and manpower. Four of the XFree86 members are on staff, me being one of them. In the desktop environment, we have four of KDE's top developers on staff as well. What do you think about the lack of a settled standard for Linux desktop user interfaces? I'm very happy to see the competition between Gnome and KDE. Monoculture and monopolies...strangle innovation. But an important part is to make sure interoperability and standardization is not left out of the picture. Are you interested in Linux on embedded devices? We are actively involved in this area. But finding a solid revenue model around the embedded market is not easy. We currently focus on the server space and the desktop space. How important to you is Itanium, the first generation of Intel's IA-64 family? Itanium is a very important project. We made available our Itanium distribution three weeks ago. It will be ready when the processors ship. Linux on IA-64 is already remarkably stable.Will Linux on Itanium provide SuSE minor or significant revenue? It's hard to say. It depends on Intel's ability to get volume shipments out this year. I'm certain once Itanium ships in volume, Linux will be the key operating system used on there.;

2002-01-02 - Intel stumbles AMD gains in 2000

Article:
| update What caused Intel to stumble in 2000 and Advance Micro Devices to enjoy one of its best years ever? A lot of little events in 1998. Back then, Intel lorded over AMD. Craig Barrett, who succeeded Andy Grove as Intel CEO in March 1998, kicked off a strategy to diversify the company's revenue base. AMD, meanwhile, was struggling with financial losses and sporadic inventory and manufacturing problems. Analysts questioned whether the company would have to find co-tenants to help pay for its planned fabrication facility in Dresden, Germany. In the background, seemingly innocuous events began to transpire. In the middle of 1998, Intel halted construction on a plant in Fort Worth, Texas, because of the tepid economic outlook in Asia and the failure of a tax reform bill in the Texas legislature, according to Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. Around the same time, Intel engineers in Folsom, Calif., were discovering that the upcoming 820 chipset for faster Pentium IIIs (code-named Coppermine) and a then relatively obscure memory technology called Rambus weren't working together as planned. "Rambus clearly was more difficult than people expected," recalled Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64. "Intel had to go back and learn about how to channel these high-speed signals on a motherboard...They were getting all sorts of subtle problems. They had to substantially upgrade the equipment they had in their labs and rethink how they did testing." Meanwhile, one exit north on Highway 101 in Sunnyvale, Calif., AMD was working on a chip called the K7. Dirk Meyer, a Digital Equipment alumnus and director of engineering at AMD, managed the project, which he would describe at the Microprocessor Forum in October. How times change Flash forward to the first half of 2000. Intel found itself mired in a dire processor shortage caused in part by a series of delays in 1999 of the 820 chipset and other parts. The scrapping of the Fort Worth plans also was having an effect. "That decision has had some consequences this year," Mulloy said. In addition, Rambus memory had failed, as predicted, to come down in price. To spur sales of Coppermine Pentium IIIs, Intel came out with a bridge chip called the Memory Translation Hub (MTH) that was supposed to allow Pentium III PCs to use cheaper standard memory. An MTH-related recall cost Intel $253 million and, more importantly, gave a black eye to its sterling reputation for manufacturing. In June, Intel canceled Timna, an inexpensive processor that would have been paired with the MTH. Non-Rambus problems cropped up too. The release schedule for Itanium, a 64-bit server chip destined to take on Sun's UltraSparc processors, was pushed back to 2001. The 1.13-MHz Pentium III was recalled. "In a little bit of our haste or excitement to get out the product, we didn't go through all of our traditional product validation," said Jeff McCrea, marketing director for Intel's desktop products group. The company managed to come out with the Pentium 4, perhaps the bright spot of the year. Still, partly because software has yet to be tweaked for the chip, benchmark tests have shown the chip to provide middling performance improvements. By contrast, AMD was seeing tremendous consumer acceptance with Athlon, the public name for the K7. With the new chip, AMD took the speed crown from Intel, landed contracts with all the major PC makers but Dell Computer, and obtained a new reputation for high-performance technology. It also didn't face shortages to the same degree. For the first time since 1995, the company will post an annual profit in 2000. AMD's turnaround While AMD's market share hasn't radically improved, its place in the market has moved. Rather than being confined to the low end, the company now has a spot in the more lucrative performance segment. In the U.S. retail market for PCs in the $1,000 to $1,500 range, AMD saw its market share go from 3.3 percent in May to 22.8 percent by September, according to figures from PC Data. Key to the company's success was improved manufacturing. Historically, AMD has flubbed chip launches, leaving them vulnerable to Intel price cuts. "They went from having a product they couldn't build to having a product they could," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. The credit for turning around the manufacturing situation belongs largely to Bill Siegel and Jim Duran, two AMD executives, said Kevin Krewell, an analyst at MicroDesign Resources and a former AMD employee. Intel has always prided itself on a manufacturing methodology called "copy exact" in which each fab is identical to the next, allowing the company to accelerate manufacturing on a new chip. "AMD had a process called 'somewhat similar,'" Krewell joked. Siegel, a former IBMer, began to correct AMD's situation in the mid-1990s, but the real benefits of his work came to the fore with Athlon. Duran, meanwhile, worked at both the Austin and Dresden facilities to see that the manufacturing improvements were carried out. "He was sort of the behind the scenes guy who ironed out the problems at Austin," Krewell said. "It was really those three guys," Meyer, Siegel and Duran. Additionally, some of the credit for the turnaround, Brookwood said, goes to Atiq Raza, AMD's former president, who left in 1999. Brookwood also gives credit to the new German plant. "It was a piece of luck that (Athlon) came out just when the industry had a capacity shortage and they had a product the industry wanted," Brookwood said. In addition, the Dresden plant allowed AMD to shift relatively painlessly to producing chips with copper, rather than aluminum, circuits, a migration that has caused problems for some other manufacturers. Intel will make the copper jump this year. Of course, both companies now face a new dilemma. Because of a worldwide economic slowdown, both Intel and AMD have warned that fourth-quarter revenue will be lower than expected. "What they are praying for is that PC demand is less than expected," said Nimal Vallipuram, an analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. The two will also face new challenges in notebooks. Transmeta burst onto the scene with its Crusoe chips, which consume less power than other chips, according to the company. Low power consumption became a reigning theme in notebooks. Despite a few hitches, Transmeta landed contracts with Sony, Hitachi and Gateway and saw its stock price more than double on its first day of trading. Who will win? Stay tuned for the next two years.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - New InfiniBand technology to remake servers--eventually

Article:
A group of the most powerful computing companies has finished the first version of InfiniBand, but it'll still be awhile before the new technology reshapes computer designs. Gartner analyst Thomas Henkel says InfiniBand is a legitimate attempt to promote a least-common-denominator standard for network interconnection, but at the same time, the InfiniBand partners are not particularly willing to give up control over their proprietary products. see commentary A consortium of computing powerhouses has completed version 1.0 of InfiniBand, a standard that governs how CPUs in a server communicate with network cards and storage systems and eventually other computers as well. Computing companies have lofty aspirations for InfiniBand, expecting it not only to eventually replace today's PCI technology but also to completely rework corporate networks of computers and data storage equipment. Though the standard is finished, it will be months before it shows up in the first hardware products. InfiniBand adoption is likely to lag further as customers wait for the technology to mature. But most expect InfiniBand to prevail in the long run, based on promises of better reliability, faster communication speeds, and the backing of giants such as IBM, Intel, Sun Microsystems, Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer and Microsoft. Intel, like IBM, foresees a day when InfiniBand connections won't just link CPUs and network cards but join together dozens or hundreds of servers. Large numbers of servers made of almost nothing but a CPU and memory will be joined with InfiniBand to large switches that handle the group's networking needs, predicted Jim Pappas, director of initiative marketing for Intel's enterprise platforms group. Likewise, InfiniBand will connect these arrays of smaller servers to big back-end servers, the kind with dozens of processors and lots of memory to hold a large database, he said. InfiniBand also will connect all these servers to dedicated storage devices, Pappas said. One predictor of how well InfiniBand will fare can be seen in PCI-X, an extension to the existing PCI standard that doubles the data transfer speed and makes a few other improvements. Compaq, IBM and HP announced PCI-X with great fanfare in September 1998, promising products using PCI-X would be available in the second half of 1999. That timetable proved to be overly ambitious. Though products have yet to ship and chips supporting PCI-X are just beginning to emerge, there already is an 83-page list of corrections and updates to the standard. "Is there anything that shows up on time?" asked Raju Vegesna, founder and chief executive of ServerWorks, a company building chips for servers that will use PCI-X. He said his company's chips are ready, but manufacturers of PCI-X cards such as network adapters are lagging. PCI-X will arrive next year, he said. "I don't think there was really much prospect of 1999," said Tom Bradicich, director of architecture and technology for IBM's Intel servers. "Ratification of the specification took until about August 1999. It's more likely (products will arrive) in the beginning of 2001. The InfiniBand schedule also has slipped. It was originally set to arrive at the end of the summer, said Bradicich, who also is co-chairman of the InfiniBand effort. It simply took some time to review the draft InfiniBand specification and the numerous comments from the dozens of companies participating in the development of the standard. "We got 3,500 comments. We wanted to be very responsible," he said. InfiniBand likely will show up in the end of 2001, Bradicich said. "It will be in...midrange to high-end servers," he said. InfiniBand initially will be most popular with Intel's 32-bit Pentium CPUs, but in the longer term will be used with the 64-bit chips such as Itanium, Pappas said. Although he agreed products will be in customers' hands by the end of 2001, he said "volume won't start until 2002." Technologies similar to InfiniBand have been used in proprietary computer designs for years. The difference with InfiniBand is that it's so widely backed. In addition to hardware makers such as Compaq and Cisco adopting it, a host of companies will produce chips to enable it. Big-name companies such as Agilent Technologies, Lucent Technologies, IBM and Intel will see competition from start-ups such as Banderacom, Mellanox and Crossroads. InfiniBand differs fundamentally from "bus" technologies such as PCI. PCI's data pathway is shared among a number of devices. InfiniBand, on the other hand, establishes connections between one device and another--a CPU and the network card, for example--without having to share the connection with other devices. InfiniBand establishes these connections by using what amounts to a miniature network within the computer. The brain behind InfiniBand is a switch, essentially a large high-speed chip that manages all the connections. Another big difference between PCI and InfiniBand is political. IBM, Compaq and HP developed PCI-X on their own, with Intel joining in later. InfiniBand has more unified support, though it took months of wrangling before Intel on one side and IBM, Compaq and HP on the other reconciled differences to come up with a unified standard. Though InfiniBand has widespread backing, it still faces competition. Motorola and other telecommunications hardware makers have backed a competing standard, RapidIO. Other backers include Cisco, Nortel Networks and Lucent. RapidIO, for the most part, doesn't compete with InfiniBand, Pappas argued. RapidIO will be used chiefly within telecommunications equipment. "I haven't seen any indication that RapidIO is the right technology for the server interconnect," he said.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Intel developing new chip for lighter laptops

Article:
Intel is designing an entirely new mobile processor it plans to debut in 2002, raising its bet that notebooks will soon come to dominate the PC market. The new and as-yet-unnamed chip will be aimed at the so-called thin and light segment--laptops weighing less than 5 pounds. It will be sold alongside mobile versions of the company's Pentium 4 and Celeron chips. The increasingly popular slimmed-down notebooks represent a challenge for Intel, as they require processors that consume less power and consequently generate less heat. Low-power consumption has been one of the main drawing cards rival chipmaker Transmeta hopes to use to grab a chunk of the market. The chip, first mentioned at the Microprocessor Forum event last October, follows Intel's tradition of segmentation. Intel developed its Celeron and Xeon chips for low-cost PCs and PC servers. The company also created, despite delays, Itanium, its high-end server chip. Like the Itanium project, the new mobile chip will be a ground-up design effort. It will include a number of design tricks aimed at decreasing power consumption while increasing overall performance. But Intel has been tight-lipped about anything other than the chip's purpose. "As we anticipate the evolving needs of the mobile market, we said we'll develop more mobile-specific CPUs," said Don MacDonald, marketing director for Intel's Mobile Platforms Group. "We'll continue to design CPUs for each and every segment," MacDonald said. "We'll end up with two significant CPU designs rather than one that voltage regulates down" as the Pentium III does. Intel estimates it will need the new mobile chip by 2002. By then, the company estimates, some 60 percent to 65 percent of the notebook market will be made up of thin and light models. These notebooks will not have the internal capacity to handle the heat produced by a mobile Pentium 4 chip, analysts say. Intel's design philosophy for the new chip is to reduce power consumption as much as possible, without sacrificing performance. "How do you get performance without increasing heat and power? That's going to require a radical rethink," MacDonald acknowledged. Power junkies Intel's former Timna design team is familiar with big challenges. Based in Israel, the group is stewarding the new chip's design. Timna was Intel's ill-fated integrated Celeron processor. The chip would have featured a processor core, input and output controller, and graphics-processing engine in a single package aimed at reducing overall PC costs. But the chip was designed for expensive Rambus-based memory, which has yet to migrate to the low end of the PC market. Intel was forced to push Timna back as it designed a memory translator hub, a chip that would translate memory signals meant for Rambus memory to the more popular SDRAM. Problems with the hub, which forced Intel to recall some 1 million motherboards, eventually led to the cancellation of Timna. But it is likely that the former Timna team will put its knowledge to good use in designing the new chip. The team's primary goal is to reduce power consumption without compromising other factors, such as clock speed, MacDonald said. That means the team will likely combine several approaches by adding greater levels of feature integration and using a gated clock transistor design. Gated clock transistors can be turned off individually when not in use, thus reducing power consumption. Intel will also use voltage switching similar to its SpeedStep Technology, which reduces voltage and clock speed on mobile Pentium III chips when a notebook is using battery power, MacDonald said. The chip will be based on an optimized version of Intel's 0.13-micron manufacturing process. Analyst believe that Intel will likely base the design for the new chip on the mobile Pentium III processor core but will add new capabilities to it. "If you just crank up the (clock) frequency, you burn up a lot of power," said Kevin Krewell, senior analyst with MicroDesign Resources, in Sunnyvale, Calif. Krewell said Intel would likely go down a path of tweaking the Pentium III core to process a greater number of instructions per clock and also to increase clock speed. He said Intel will likely use a fairly large 512KB Level 2 cache as well as a new multimedia instruction set, possibly the Pentium 4's SSE-2. Intel's track record with Rambus memory has been less than successful so far. Krewell said the company likely will avoid another Timna fiasco by choosing Double Data Rate (DDR) SDRAM memory. The chipmaker will also integrate a memory controller for SDRAM into the chip to save space and power and cut memory latency, he added. "The real question is whether they'll pull graphics onboard," Krewell said. "Putting graphics onboard would limit the flexibility" of the chip. Instead, "something like what Transmeta's Crusoe is right now would be optimal for Intel," Krewell said. The Crusoe chip sports an onboard DDR memory controller but requires separate a I/O controller and graphics, giving it flexibility to be used in several different kinds of notebooks. The new mobile chip will compliment a forthcoming mobile version of the Pentium 4, based on Intel's 0.13-micron manufacturing process, which is code-named Northwood.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Sun's brash Zander talks tough against competitors

Article:
Sun Microsystems chief operating officer Ed Zander may not be as outspoken as his boss, Scott McNealy, but he's a close second. Zander, who has been with Sun since 1987, has seen the company claw its way from a seller of niche Unix workstations to a powerhouse of the computing landscape. By selling ever-increasing numbers of powerful and profitable server computers--the brains of the Internet and of corporate networks--Sun has put Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Intel on the defensive. In doing so, though, Sun has stepped on more than a few toes. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company has run into trouble trying to spread its Java software as widely as possible while simultaneously maintaining some control. It's also roused the wrath of Intel, which accused Sun of not working hard enough to get Sun's Solaris operating system working on Intel's upcoming high-end Itanium processors. But Zander is unapologetic. In a wide-ranging interview with News.com, he took on Intel, Microsoft, and even the Linux movement that so many companies work hard to curry favor with. CNET News.com: A lot of people call Java proprietary to a certain degree. Zander: Bah! Java will go down, 10 to 20 years from now, as the most open, standard language and software environment that has hit our industry as long as I've been around. Here it is four and a half years later, we've got 2.5 million programmers in Java, we've got every educational institution and high school teaching children (Java). I don't get a dime for this stuff. You have these guys--GM and Ford and BMW and Motorola...and Nokia and Symbian and Mastercard and Visa--all doing Java without anything to do with Sun, other than to give us a call every once in awhile to ask us technical questions. What makes it so incredibly interesting and why Microsoft gets so bent about it is the fact that...once I say I'm writing a Java application, I can run it on (any Java-enabled) device. It seems that's conformance to Java functioning, not Java branding. No, because at the end of the day, what makes a McDonald's french fry is there is a spec and you have to conform to it. And what makes Solaris (Sun's version of the Unix operating system) Solaris, and why I have the market position we have today, is because there is one Solaris. So you have a spec and a conformance to a brand. It's so important to the Java brand that we maintain it. If you're going to build a Java virtual machine, we only ask you to...pass the conformance. And that's what Microsoft didn't want to do. Microsoft wanted--this is so clear and simple--they wanted to take the spec and add extensions and still call it Java. Outside of three companies--HP and Microsoft and depending on what day of the week it is, IBM--nobody complains about Java. Sun software evangelist George Paolini was talking about eventually open-sourcing it. We would love to some day. At what point? When we think innovation has happened to the point where we have pervasiveness. And even with open source, if you're going to use the Java brand, you passed the conformance test. The thing with Linux today--I call it the bathtub. I can throw source in there. It's all floating around and it's available to everybody. But I as a vendor can take anything I want out of that bathtub and call it Linux. Now if you think that's going to work for application developers, call me in a year or two when IBM's Linux is different than HP's Linux is different than Dell's Linux and (a customer) will have to recompile five times. You've broken it effectively. So you cannot depend on one Linux. It still seems like there's some uncertainty about where software fits in at Sun. I think we haven't marketed well. I think where the problem is we always live with this hardware overhang. It's hard to get the press and the analysts to understand how important it is inside the company. We've got more software programmers than hardware programmers inside the company. We've got some really good substance here. It's Java; it's the tools that we've been collecting under Forte and NetBeans that we haven't done a good job in marketing; it's the iPlanet strategy; and it's Solaris. Why is Sun so interested in bringing Solaris to Itanium? Here it is nine years later since I did some Intel deal and people still doubt our intention. We realized there were two platforms back in 1990 that were going to survive. One was Intel; that was easy to pick. The other one was (Sun's) Sparc. People didn't believe us. There is today a huge business for Sparc applications and there's a huge business for Intel. So we ported Solaris to Intel. We spent years and tens of millions of dollars, if not more, converting the source base, and nearly crippled Sun back in '92 and '93 doing that. Today we have one source base and we compile twice (once for Intel and once for Sparc chips). We entered into a deal with Intel several years ago to do Itanium. We did it and they reneged. I think they just didn't deliver on their commitments. They're confusing the success of Sun in the marketplace with the Solaris-on-Itanium port, and they don't realize that their success in the marketplace is (tied to) Solaris. So if anything, if I was them, I would embrace Solaris tonight on Itanium and market it to Compaq and Dell and HP and everybody else. So who needs the other partner more? Do you need Intel more than they need Solaris? We don't need anybody (now). In the industry five years ago, seven years ago...I don't think Intel needed us; we needed them. Sparc did not have the breadth and application base. Today we are growing at 30 to 40 percent a year. And applications are coming over here in droves. How has the collapse of the dot-com euphoria affected Sun? I never thought Toothpaste.com was going to make Sun. We did know that working with the optical companies and the Internet infrastructure companies and the Inktomis and the portals was going to drive a lot of this. Plus we also knew when we talked to a GM and a GE and a Citibank and a Gap and a Wal-Mart that they were going to re-architect their supply chains and business processes and customer service stuff. That's where the money was going to be made in this whole dot-com area--that they were going to dot-com themselves like Sun was. But it was great to say, "We're the dot in dot-com," because it got everybody focused on Sun being an Internet infrastructure supplier. I figured there might have been a shakeout at some time, but we had a very small part of our business in that anyway. Don't confuse AOL with a new dot-com company. I look at AOL and eBay, I look at Exodus, I look at Digix--these guys are going to be players for a while. I'm curious about the Sun-AOL iPlanet software suite. Most of iPlanet is now run by Sun folks. You said 800 out of 2,500 iPlanet folks are AOL employees. What's the future direction for that? Is that going to become an all-Sun shop at some point? We may of course see more and more Sun personnel building these products because that's our area of expertise. But you're going to see (Sun) working closely with AOL on understanding the end-to-end architectures--how iPlanet technology can benefit AOL. And we'll be working on even things around Java and appliances that are outside of iPlanet but things we can do with AOL. We like the relationship. I can't tell you the intangible benefits we've gotten here at Sun understanding a consumer portal company that deals with 30 million subscribers. There's a ton of stuff we sold to them. I don't know the numbers. And then of course the doors have opened up to us because I think the combination of the two brought us into (new) accounts. We got a ton of server business that maybe we wouldn't have gotten. What's changed in your job since you were promoted in April 1999, becoming president as well as chief operating officer? Probably the only change that has really been hard for me is most of my role as COO goes to produce the (revenue and profit) numbers, to make the (new) products. The president's role has got me more external. Dealing with the customers, dealing with strategic relationships, dealing with some of our partners has helped take a load off Scott to come in to the companies and close the deals. You've said that by the end of this year, about half of Sun employees will have less than two years' seniority with the company. Scaling the company is probably Scott's and my biggest challenge right now. You realize as executives that it's probably more (a problem) than any competitor. It's your biggest challenge. How do you assimilate, train, (teach the Sun) culture?;

2002-01-02 - SGI banks on Linux Intel chips

Article:
LAS VEGAS--SGI will demonstrate a cluster of Linux computers running Intel's new Itanium processors, the company said today. The company will demonstrate the machine at Supercomputing 99, a computer show in Portland, Oregon, the company said at Comdex here today. Mountain View, California-based SGI, which sells servers and workstations, is in the midst of a years-long transition to the Itanium chips, formerly code-named Merced. Intel has built prototypes, but Itanium computer systems aren't expected until the second half of 2000. Delays to the chip, however, forced SGI to extend its Mips chip family, former SGI chief executive Rick Belluzzo said in an earlier interview. In addition to moving from Mips chips to Intel chips, SGI is moving from the Irix operating system to Linux. The company wants Linux to run on systems with hundreds of processors, and SGI is contributing effort to the multicompany Trillian project to achieve that goal. The technology transitions at SGI raise the possibility that a government-funded supercomputer could run the Linux operating system. SGI is moving to Intel chips so it can take advantage of the lower prices for chips made in larger quantities. Hewlett-Packard, which invented the architecture for the Itanium chip, is embarking on a similar plan and joined Intel to make those high-volume sales possible. While SGI is moving ahead with Itanium-based systems, it's also spinning off its Cray Research supercomputer division. However, the prospects for Cray are in question. VA Linux Systems also is working on connecting lots of Linux computers. The company, which has filed to go public in coming weeks, announced a machine at Argonne National Laboratory with 256 two-processor machines. The machine, called "Chiba City," will be available to many researchers testing open-source software such as managing clusters of computers, visualizing scientific information and distributing computing jobs over many machines. The computers are tied together with the "Beowulf" method. Chiba City is a futuristic city in William Gibson's science fiction novel "Neuromancer," the book in which Gibson coined the term "cyberspace." Fifty Argonne researchers built the machine in two days at a "barn-raising," complete with a banjo, VA said in a statement. Chiba City also uses IBM servers to manage the system;

2002-01-02 - Intel urges investors to take long view

Article:
Business might be down now, but it's going to get better, Intel executives told Wall Street on Thursday. Although the worldwide economic slump has maimed the company's bottom line, some of the economic conditions hurting the semiconductor industry are beginning to abate, said Intel CEO Craig Barrett and other executives at the company's analyst meeting in New York. Spending on capital equipment and research, combined with administrative cost reductions, will also continue. "Investing in new technology is the only way to make yourself stronger coming out of a recession," Barrett said. Increasing capital spending to recover from a recession, Chairman Andy Grove added, could safely be called Moore's second law, named for former Intel CEO Gordon Moore, who formulated the maxim that computer processing power doubles roughly every 18 months. Additionally, the company will release a host of new chips for servers, PCs and portables, including a 2GHz Pentium 4, 1.1GHz notebook chips and Xscale chips for handheld devices. Still, Grove warned that the chip giant has to watch out for sudden shifts. Holding up a series of charts from the 1981 analysts' meeting, Grove showed how Intel's business of providing chips for mainframe terminals had been growing quite well in the 1970s and 1980. Then, in the first quarter of 1981, "net income practically disappeared overnight," he said. At the time, IBM was popularizing the PC with corporations. The rest is history. Asia will also play a huge part in any recovery. Historically, the Americas have been Intel's largest geographic market. In the fourth quarter of 2000, however, greater Asia, which combines Asia-Pacific with Japan, accounted for more revenue because of accelerating growth in China and India, said Mike Splinter, executive vice president for marketing and sales. Overall, more than 60 percent of Intel's revenue comes from overseas. "Even as growth resumes in our (American) business, I expected this trend to continue," Splinter said. Eventually, "Asia-Pacific will be our largest region." The region also will continue to grow in importance as a manufacturing arm. For years, major U.S. PC manufacturers have outsourced desktop and notebook manufacturing to Asia. Increasingly, cell phone manufacturers are turning to Asia, and Intel is currently locking up deals with local companies such as China's Legend to use Intel processors. A total of 26 Asian contract manufacturers just agreed to endorse Intel's Personal Internet Client Architecture (PICA), a blueprint for cell phones and handheld computers. "We have long-standing relationships with these companies," Splinter said. As far as product segments go, inventories of PC chips have begun to fall, said executives, although there are still large inventories of communications chips and flash memory, which will retard sales of those products. Looking long term, all of the executives maintained companies will continue to invest in communications and computing infrastructure. As for products, Intel provided some new details of upcoming chips but largely reiterated plans the company has shared at other events. A 2GHz Pentium 4 for desktops will come out in the third quarter, said Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel Architecture Group. Speeds will also continue to escalate, now that the new chip design has hit the market. "Over its life, it (the Pentium 4) will scale above 10GHz," he said. "In the past year, you have seen Intel struggling, quite frankly, to get the next hundred megahertz out of the Pentium III." Higher speeds, lower prices While speed will go up, costs will decline. Smaller, less costly versions of the Pentium 4 made with the 0.13-micron manufacturing process will come out in the fourth quarter. In addition, smaller computer chassis coming in the second quarter will reduce costs. Currently, the base cost of materials for the cheapest PCs, minus processor and memory, is $175. That will drop to between $150 and $125, Otellini predicted. Prices on Rambus memory will also go down, and a chipset called the 845 will allow PC makers to marry Pentium 4s to regular, less-expensive memory toward the end of the year. Recent price cuts and continued collaboration with hardware makers and software developers will also help proliferate the chip. Already, Pentium 4 computers can be found for less than $1,000 in the United States, he said. For notebooks, Pentium IIIs running at 1.1GHz and faster made on the 0.13-micron process will come out in the third quarter, along with chips for the subnotebook market running at more than 700MHz. In subnotebooks, Intel chips will offer chips running at "twice the performance and less than half the power consumed" relative to competing chips from Transmeta, Otellini added. Meanwhile, Itanium processors for servers will come out this quarter. "This is the quarter many of us have waited five or six years for," he said. As previously reported, the successor to the first Itanium, called McKinley, will appear in pilot projects at the end of the year. The chip will contain 240 million transistors and run at speeds of 1GHz or higher. In handheld devices, Intel will continue to pursue contracts with cell phone and handheld-computer manufacturers while also working with application developers to create new software for Internet-enabled cell phones. The first Xscale chips, the successor to the StrongARM family, will come out in the second half. "We will enable parallel development of the communications technology, the computing technology and the applications that run on top of it," said Ron Smith, general manager of the Wireless Communications and Computing Group. "This unlocks the so-called wireless Internet to the PC application developers." Palm also has endorsed Intel's chips, he said. While showing a slide of software companies that have adopted StrongARM, Smith told analysts, "We could even add Palm to this list because they have already announced that they will (support) our StrongARM and Xscale processors." A deal to get Intel chips inside Palm devices has been in the works since last year, according to sources. Every product-division head at Intel made a presentation except for John Miner, who heads up the New Business Group, which oversees Intel Online services and other efforts. Several projects in this group were canceled last year. Miner took over the group earlier this year.;

2002-01-02 - Oracle commits to Monterey OS

Article:
Oracle announced its support of the upcoming Monterey operating system, a joint program by IBM and Santa Cruz Operation to create a version of Unix for Intel's upcoming 64-bit processors. While analysts expected Oracle ultimately to support Monterey, the database software maker hadn't committed until today. "People have been waiting for Oracle to endorse, support, or do anything with Monterey," said a Santa Cruz Operation spokesperson, noting that negotiations can take a long time. "We're certainly very happy about it." Monterey is a project to combine three versions of Unix--IBM's AIX, Sequent's Dynix/ptx, and SCO's UnixWare--into a single version that will run both on IBM's Power chips and on Intel's 64-bit chips. Intel is scheduled to release the first of those "IA-64" chips, called Itanium and formerly code-named Merced, in mid-2000 with computers using it later that year. "We're interested in consolidating Unix so our customers and [software companies] can spend their time working on their software instead of porting to different flavors of Unix," said Oracle's Mike Rocha in a news conference today. Signing up major software companies is critical to establishing the success of a new operating system and a new chip architecture, and database companies in particular are a necessary ingredient given Intel's e-commerce push for these new chips. Other software companies committed to Monterey include Netscape Communications, PeopleSoft, Baan, Tivoli, BEA Systems, Marcam Solutions, Informix, Computer Associates, and BMC. Other versions of Unix for the IA-64 will include Sun Microsystems' Solaris and Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX. In addition, Linux, a close relative of Unix, will be available. Other computer makers are taking different approaches. SGI chose to adopt Linux instead of porting its Irix version of Unix, and Compaq Computer reversed its commitment to provide its Tru64 Unix on IA-64. Monterey-64 is up and running on Itanium prototypes. Oracle will contribute some of its own software to Monterey and AIX. It will help add its Oracle Internet Directory, software that makes it easier for companies with large numbers of computers to find network resources such as printers and keep track of details such as the Internet addresses of different servers. Oracle announced earlier this year Oracle Internet Directory, which will be integrated into Oracle 8i and be an alternative to Microsoft's Active Directory technology. Oracle Internet Directory will be part of the company's Oracle 8i database, a move that analysts say further strengthens the company's goal of providing an all-in-one Internet deployment platform and an alternative to Microsoft's Windows NT and other server-based software. The company will integrate it with the Novell Directory Services (NDS), a popular directory technology, to make sure they can work together. The Oracle Internet Directory joins other new features the company is including in the database, such as built-in development tools and an internal file system for storing and managing Web pages as well as Windows application files. Oracle 8i also will be available on several other versions of Unix, including Solaris, HP-UX, Tru64 Unix, and Linux, but the company hopes for some consolidation in the Unix area, Rocha said.News.com's Mike Ricciuti contributed to this report.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Itanium scores high in performance tests

Article:
Even though Intel's new Itanium chip arrived years late, some of its performance numbers have drawn qualified praise from industry analysts. Two key chip speed measurements using standards set by testing organization Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) show the 800MHz Itanium in some cases neck-in-neck with Sun Microsystems' newest UltraSparc III chip and in some cases soundly beating it. Sun is Intel's chief competitor when it comes to trying to win a place for Itanium, a chip Intel announced Tuesday. One measurement of "floating-point" mathematical calculations shows Itanium soundly beating UltraSparc III--even the delayed 900MHz version due to arrive shortly. But when it comes to more ordinary "integer" operations, Itanium is behind Sun's chip and even Intel's own Xeon server chip. "The SpecFP (floating-point) number was just phenomenal, but the SpecInt (integer) number was very weak," said MicroDesign Resources analyst Kevin Krewell. "Intel has not been able to provide a very good reason why that number was so weak." "We feel (integer performance) is competitive today with UltraSparc III, and we expect it to get better with McKinley," the second-generation Itanium model due in the first half of 2002, said Intel spokesman Seth Walker, who said Itanium shines on higher-level benchmarks such as database performance or data encryption. Itanium is the first of a new high-end line of chips from Intel that speak a totally different language from the existing low-end Celeron, mid-range Pentium and high-end Xeon lines. The existing products are 32-bit chips, but the Itanium is a 64-bit model, the key difference between the two being the ability to accommodate vast amounts of memory. Itanium vs. Sun Two key chip measurements from testing company Standard Performance Evaluation show that Intel's new 800MHz Itanium server chip is neck and neck with Sun's newest UltraSparc III chip and, in some cases, Itanium is soundly beating it. SpecInt: Measures relative speed in computing processes such as compressing a file, word processing or compiling software. Higher numbers mean greater performance. Sun UltraSparc III, 750MHz: 395 Sun UltraSparc III, 900MHz: 467 Intel Itanium, 800MHz: 404 SpecFP: Measures mathematical processes such as drawing 3D images or simulating nuclear physics. Sun UltraSparc III, 750MHz: 421 Sun UltraSparc III, 900 MHz: 482 Intel Itanium, 800MHz: 711 Sources: Intel, Standard Performance Evaluation Itanium, delayed several times from its planned arrival in the 1990s, was spawned by a collaboration between Hewlett-Packard and Intel. The chip is a key element of Intel's strategy to bring to top-end servers and workstations its philosophy of high-volume manufacturing and support from multiple computer makers. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has been largely locked out of the market, which is dominated by 64-bit chips from Sun, IBM, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and SGI. Piper Jaffray analyst Ashok Kumar believes Intel ultimately will succeed. "Itanium itself is a solid product, but it doesn't blow the doors off the competition, as Intel had initially hoped (and hyped)," Kumar wrote in a report Wednesday. "But it is best viewed as the first step in a long line of processors that will eventually dominate the high end of computing, pushing aside current competitors such as IBM's Power family and Sun's Sparc processors." Itanium beats even Compaq's lauded Alpha chip, Terry Shannon, author of the Shannon Knows Compaq newsletter, said in a note Tuesday. But Shannon predicted Alphas running at higher clock speeds--1GHz chips are expected by mid-July--"will restore Alpha's performance leadership across the board." Itanium didn't convince Shannon that its design "will doom rival architectures to near-term obsolescence." Krewell predicted IBM's coming Power4 chip, due to arrive in servers this fall, also will keep the pressure on Itanium. But delays have hampered Itanium's prospects. "If this product had come out last year, it would have been a much more impressive part," Krewell said. More than just the numbers But raw performance is just one of a host of factors Itanium faces in the marketplace. Of greater concern has been the fact that software must be completely rewritten to take advantage of Itanium's performance. Although older software designed for the earlier 32-bit chips will run, Itanium performance on such tasks is dismal. The situation hasn't escaped Sun's notice. "We think that this announcement actually enhances our competitiveness because it highlights the transitions that customers and vendors need to go through with the Itanium," said said Nancy Weintraub, director of marketing for system products at Sun. Customers must recompile their software for the new chip and re-certify it for the new systems, she said, whereas Sun customers are guaranteed that software written for earlier UltraSparc chips will run unmodified on the UltraSparc III. Intel and its business partners have only just begun the laborious process of getting software ready for Itanium. The first version of Microsoft's Windows XP for Itanium workstations isn't expected until Oct. 25, and higher-level software such as databases likely will arrive even later. "We do not expect Itanium to be broadly deployed," Kumar said. Though some scientific users will buy the systems, "most businesses will purchase only a few Itanium systems for software development and testing." Intel is girding for a struggle with Sun and others that could go on for years, though. Broader use will come with the second-generation McKinley chip due in systems a year from now. And another successor, code-named Madison and due in early 2003, is expected to be three times faster than the first Itanium, Kumar said. Though introducing a totally new design is very hard on programmers and customers who must totally rewrite software, Sun and others will see their designs run out of steam and likely will have to take the drastic step Intel took when moving to the Itanium, Krewell said. "At some point in time, you've got to break the previous architecture and start from scratch," Krewell said. "I think the UltraSparc architecture is getting old." Intel has pushed its comparatively ancient 32-bit designs remarkably far, though, and Weintraub defended Sun's design. "We feel very strongly about the longevity of the Sparc chip," Weintraub said.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - VA Linux profit outlook depends on hardware

Article:
For VA Linux Systems, the road to profitability is paved with better hardware. The company, flush with funds from its record-setting IPO, has launched an ambitious plan to become one of the leading providers of servers to the Internet, said CEO Larry Augustin in an interview with News.com. Intel's upcoming Itanium processor and improvements to the Linux OS will be the first steps in the company's expansion, and plans for Europe and Asia will follow. Profit, however, will still be some time off, at least two years, Augustin said. Analysts expect VA to become profitable in late 2001 or early 2002, he said. VA Linux manufactures computers with Intel chips and the Linux operating system, a clone of Unix that competes with Microsoft. Linux, with its original programming instructions open for all to work with, is developed by a small army of "open-source" programmers. VA Linux, whose record IPO last month raised $132 million, plans to use the money to expand into Europe and Asia and increase its effort to packages services along with its hardware, Augustin said. It seems to be increasingly painless for Linux companies to get funding, with some winning investments from venture capital or computing companies, and others pulling in tens of millions through IPOs. Caldera Systems, a seller of Linux software, broke new ground yesterday by announcing both a $30 million investment and plans to go public. But getting money wasn't the main reason for an IPO, Augustin said. "We felt it was very important to be a public company because of the legitimacy it brings to the company and to Linux," he said. "It's not so much the cash infusion." Augustin admits there's increasing competition for Linux computers, with newer companies such as Penguin Computing joining established giants such as IBM, Dell Computer, Compaq Computer and Hewlett-Packard. But VA Linux doesn't want to conquer the entire market, Augustin said, just the back-end part of things. "We will dominate the Internet infrastructure market," he said. VA Linux has ambitious plans to expand its product line from its current stronghold--low-end server systems that companies often buy in bulk--into higher-end servers. To make these machines worthwhile, VA Linux is awaiting better chips from Intel and better high-end features in Linux itself. The guts of Linux, the software known as the kernel, is about to be upgraded from version 2.2 to version 2.4. Linus Torvalds, founder of the Linux movement and leader of the kernel development effort, initially hoped to release 2.4 before Jan. 1, but said in December that the revised schedule was to release it in the first quarter of 2000. Some have suggested that the new kernel will be released on Feb. 17, the same day Microsoft plans to make Windows 2000 available to customers. The 2.4 kernel will enable two key features for VA Linux in servers: the ability to let Intel chips talk to larger amounts of memory and a "journaling" file system that will make it easier for Linux computers to recover from crashes. Currently, Linux on Intel chips can handle only 2 gigabytes of memory. But Intel's Xeon chips can handle up to 32GB, a capability Linux will be able to take advantage of with the 2.4 kernel. Handling that extra memory is important for VA Linux, whose customers want to be able to hold entire Web sites in memory for fast response to Web servers. VA Linux also is awaiting Intel's 64-bit Itanium chip, due in mid-2000, which will allow computers to talk to vastly larger amounts of memory. That feature will be key for use of Linux by corporations who have large databases they want to hold entirely in memory, something that's generally possible only with 64-bit chips from Compaq, Sun, HP, IBM or SGI. Eight-processor systems also hold appeal for VA Linux. Currently, with the 2GB memory limitations of Linux, four-processor systems are barely justifiable, and eight-way machines aren't. "You need to have enough memory per processor for it to make sense," he said. "It's sort of an imbalance." For more modest servers, VA Linux ultimately hopes to whittle its rack-mountable, two-processor, 3.5-inch-tall FullOn servers into a size half that tall, a move that would enable the servers to be stacked even more densely at companies that need oodles of servers to house Web pages or fire queries at back-end databases. VA Linux also plans to sell more Linux computers for desktop use in the future, though right now such products generally sell only to developers and other technically savvy users, Augustin said. However, VA doesn't intent to ever get into smaller devices such as set-top boxes. Though companies such as Red Hat, Linuxcare, Santa Cruz Operation and even IBM are gunning for the same Linux services as VA Linux, Augustin is confident it will be able to stave off competitors. VA Linux will focus its expertise on helping companies design and assemble collections of hardware and software heavily customized for the task at hand. "This is the space we will own and go after," Augustin declared. Apparently investors were convinced by the plan. VA Linux had no difficulty rounding up underwriters to help the company go public, and the company met a strong response while pitching its business to potential investors on the "road show" that precedes an IPO. "As we were out on the road show, we knew there was a lot of interest," he said. "The bankers came back (with) very strong investor interest." Indeed VA Linux raised its expected price range from $11 to $13 to $21 to $23, then eventually to $28 to $30. The shares eventually priced out at $30, raising the company $132 million instead of the initial $57 million that was expected. Augustin acknowledges a debt of gratitude owed to Red Hat, whose IPO four months earlier paved the way for other Linux companies to come. Red Hat taught investors about the nature of Linux and open-source software, and instructed VA Linux ways to improve a Linux IPO, Augustin said. For Augustin, that improvement meant reworking the directed shares program Red Hat used to include thousands of open-source programmers in their IPO, with mixed results. "We discovered that a lot of individual investors who didn't understand the process were filling out forms," Augustin said. VA Linux didn't have those difficulties.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - The week in review Inside Intel's plans for the future

Article:
Intel stole the spotlight this week, showing off new chips for cell phones and handheld computers, talking strategy and predicting a rival's doom. Intel released details on the Pentium 4 and showcased new chips for cell phones and handheld computers. The Pentium 4 features a completely new architecture called "NetBurst" designed to handle tasks--such as data encryption, video compression or Napster-like peer-to-peer networking--that have grown in popularity with the Internet. The upcoming Pentium 4 will be more than twice as big as the Pentium III and approximately 28 percent bigger than anticipated, an increase that will boost Intel's manufacturing cost and limit the number of chips produced. Most initial Itanium chips will run at 733 MHz, slower than the 800 MHz expected, but there are a host of other high-end computer products to compensate for the disappointment. The chip's speed is a lesser factor than architectural improvements such as the 64-bit design that allows it to hold vast databases within memory. But the slower speed indicates difficulties with the manufacturing process for the large new chip. Intel will ratchet up the speed of its high-end Xeon chips to 1 GHz, which has more psychological value than practical utility because of bottlenecks talking to memory and other components in a computer. Xeons are used primarily in servers, the computers that are the brains of computer networks. Intel executives predict the peer-to-peer technology popularized by Napster could usher in the next wave of the Internet and, in the process, save companies billions of dollars by using computing power already in place. The chip giant and others have invested $9 million in a start-up that will make chips for the upcoming InfiniBand technology for high-speed connections among servers, storage systems and networks. Intel CEO Craig Barrett compared Sun Microsystems to communism, saying the server maker represents an increasingly outmoded way of doing business because it locks corporate customers into products or services from a single seller. "If (Sun CEO) Scott McNealy's model worked, communism would still be prevalent and challenging capitalism." You've got email Yahoo plans to let its mail account holders use data scrambling to protect the privacy of their email messages, marking a potentially significant advance for the mainstream use of encryption. When the system launches, it will let Yahoo Mail account holders send messages through ZixIt's SecureDelivery.com site. The deal will make Yahoo the first major portal to offer encrypted email. Network Associates confirmed that emails encrypted using its PGP software may be vulnerable to a sophisticated attacker. PGP--Pretty Good Privacy--is used by 7 million people worldwide. Some businesses use it to send confidential documents. Microsoft is "thoroughly investigating" a scenario in which expired Hotmail accounts are thought to provide an avenue for either malicious or unwitting appropriation of existing IM usernames and contact lists. One Hotmail user says he lost his account because of inactivity, and when he created a new account with the same name, he found that his old IM contact list lingered with the cleaned-out account. USA.net, which has powered WebMail since its 1998 launch, will lose its only major portal customer when Netscape Communications' Netcenter migrates its WebMail accounts to its own service this fall. Netcenter has 7 million account holders using USA.net-powered email and just fewer than a million using its new homegrown service. Dow Chemical plans to fire about 40 employees for allegedly violating the company's email policy by circulating violent or sexually explicit material. The firings follow a review of 6,000 email accounts conducted after a worker complained about offensive email. Chain of command After Larry Ellison almost died at sea in December 1998, the swashbuckling chief executive began wondering who would run Oracle if something were to happen to him. The answer is anything but clear. Many sources close to the company believe that, regardless of titles, Ellison will remain firmly in control as long he stays with the corporation. That question--as well as speculation as to who is running the $200 billion database powerhouse right now--has been a topic of conversation throughout the high-tech industry ever since longtime No. 2 executive Ray Lane abruptly resigned in June. Lane joined the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as a general partner because he will be able to spend more time with his family, as the nature of the VC industry is changing. "I'm trying to stay true to my goal of building balance in my life. I want to have more time with my kids," Lane said. After just three months in the job, Razorfish president Michael Pehl resigned. New York-based Razorfish, a consultancy for Internet strategies and Web site design, did not name Pehl's replacement. He will continue to work with the company on a consulting basis. A year following his ascension to CEO, Bob Bishop runs a very different SGI than predecessor Rick Belluzzo. It's been a gut-wrenching year of tough decisions, many of which put Bishop in the hot seat with investors and Wall Street analysts. Handhelds in hand Retail sales of handheld computers are set to double this year, granting the once geeky devices mass-market status. Sales of personal digital assistants (PDAs) from Palm and Microsoft are surging. PDA sales for this year already equal sales for all of 1999, with a strong holiday season around the corner likely to boost the numbers more. XScale--the successor to Intel's StrongArm chip architecture--will power future generations of handheld computers, mobile phones and the backbone of the wireless network. Intel said the new design will enable entirely new types of wireless devices that can be powered by a single AA battery, but the company would not discuss specific speeds. A possible shortage of parts means Nintendo won't sell Game Boy Advance until March 21 in Japan and next July in North America and Europe. Nintendo said the delay was caused by parts shortages, as sales of the Game Boy Color handhelds are still growing and monopolizing the supply of components.

Title:
2002-01-02 - Red Hat cashing in early on Itanium chip

Article:
Intel's Itanium chip isn't even for sale yet, but already it's become a revenue generator for Linux company Red Hat. The company today announced services, some of them free and some of them costing a fee, for companies that wish to bring their software or hardware to the Itanium chip. The announcement was made at today's Intel Developer Forum in San Jose, Calif. Itanium, which has been delayed by Intel so that systems won't arrive until next year, is the first in a family of 64-bit chips from the company. It hopes to use Itanium and future 64-bit chips to overpower high-end computer systems from Sun Microsystems, IBM, Compaq Computer and others. Intel believes the three operating systems that will prevail on the new IA-64 chip family are Linux, Windows 64 and IBM's AIX 5L version of Unix, formerly known as the product of Project Monterey. Customers of the Red Hat service, called JumpStart, so far include SteelEye Technology, Avant Technology, Sendmail, Tibco, Rational Software and Unify, Red Hat said. The services include Netfarm, a group of IA-64 computers that developers can use over the Internet; training for installing and configuring Linux on the IA-64 computers; help with translating software to the new architecture; Red Hat certification of hardware or software; and marketing perks such as being included in Red Hat white papers or direct mail advertising. In addition, Red Hat provides free Web support with other fee-based support packages. Red Hat isn't the only Linux company interested in IA-64. VA Linux Systems, for example, in May unveiled a free collection of servers called a CompileFarm that programmers can use over the Internet. Intel chairman Andy Grove said a year ago that his company would support such efforts to provide remote servers, one of a host of ways Intel has changed its usually secretive behavior to accommodate the free-wheeling open-source programming community that creates Linux. TurboLinux was the first to come up with a version of Linux for IA-64 in March. Red Hat followed in May. Since then, competitors SuSE and Caldera Systems also have passed the milestone. Competitors have adopted similar strategies. Intel competitor AMD is luring Linux programmers to a 64-bit chip called Sledgehammer that will compete with Intel's IA-64 family, Meanwhile, Microsoft has been sending copies of its upcoming 64-bit version of Windows to anyone who has an IA-64 machine. Hewlett-Packard, the company that originally came up with the design of the IA-64 chips and that gradually will switch its own high-performance computers to the new architecture, also has been supporting the effort. Company researcher David Mosberger still leads the effort to create an IA-64 Linux kernel, and HP released simulation equipment that enables people lacking IA-64 prototypes to see whether their software works.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Tools help Linux make strides with new Intel chip

Article:
The effort to bring Linux to Intel's next-generation Itanium chip moved forward today with the arrival of critical programming tools, another key step for the upstart operating system. Linux distributor Red Hat today released the crucial software--called a "compiler"--that translates programs into instructions that can be understood by Intel's upcoming 64-bit Itanium chip. The move comes at a time when a similar development effort between Sun Microsystems and Intel has turned into an ugly spat. Itanium is the first member of a new class of more powerful processors from the chipmaker. Hardware maker SGI said it will release its compiler as well, promising that its version will result in faster programs. Relatively few Itanium computers exist, because the chip is still available only in prototype form. But the arrival of compilers is important. It will enable the worldwide group of programmers who collectively develop Linux to take the first steps in making sure the open-source OS and all its components work on Itanium machines. With the compilers, developers will be able to start testing software drivers for countless network cards, hard disk arrays, video systems and other essential hardware components. Linux, a clone of the Unix operating system and competitor to Windows, is growing increasingly important in Itanium plans. Intel has invested in Linux companies such as Red Hat, SuSE, TurboLinux and VA Linux Systems, and now Dell Computer is warming to Linux in favor of proprietary versions of the Unix OS. "The proprietary Unix world is giving way to the open-standards world," said Carl Everett, senior vice president of Dell's personal systems group, in an interview yesterday. Earlier this month, a coalition of companies released the first version of Linux for Itanium, code-named Trillian. The SGI and Red Hat compilers will be released as open source, meaning that anyone may modify the workings of the software. Both packages will be released under the Gnu General Public License, which means theoretically that the two compilers could be merged. Compilers are a critical ingredient for the Itanium chip. Much of the performance gain that's expected from Itanium will only become a reality if compilers can line up instructions in just the right way so that the chip can operate efficiently. And compilers also are an essential tool for getting higher-level software, such as databases or e-commerce software, to work on the new chip. "For this architecture, you really need a great compiler," said HP's David Mosberger in an interview earlier this month. Mosberger has been working on Linux for Intel's upcoming chip families for two years. Mosberger said Linux compilers work about as well as other compilers, but that there's "a lot of head room to optimize them better in the future." The Linux news comes as Sun has run into trouble bringing its Solaris operating system to the new chips. Intel said it will offer only minimal help to Sun because Sun wasn't doing enough to encourage software companies to use Intel chips instead of Sun's own UltraSparc chips.;

2002-01-02 - Recall may hurt Intel but will AMD benefit

Article:
Intel's pain is not necessarily Advanced Micro Devices' gain. Competition from AMD contributed to Intel's recent production problems, but AMD's limited chipmaking capacity will prevent it from cashing in on the embarrassing mistakes, according to analysts. Meta Group says Intel's recall of its high-end Pentium III processor is a black eye for the company and hands competitor Advanced Micro Devices a PR coup. see commentary  Pressure to outrace AMD led Intel to crank its Pentium III to 1.13 GHz, a speed that was not on its initial road map, analysts said. Unfortunately, the chip's design apparently wasn't ready to go that fast. "Intel has been pushing the clock speed on Pentium III really hard to keep up with AMD," said analyst Linley Gwennap of The Linley Group. "When you push a chip beyond what it was designed to do, you run into problems." Intel would not comment directly on whether the speed race with AMD caused it to stumble. But a spokesman said, "It's a disappointment if (a chip) is introduced and has a quality issue" associated with it. The two chipmakers have been battling to offer the fastest PC processor since AMD debuted its Athlon chip last year. While Intel has stumbled, AMD has turned from a gang that couldn't shoot straight to a formidable competitor. Yesterday the company introduced its 1.1-GHz Athlon and said a number of computer makers including Hewlett-Packard and Gateway were adopting the chip. Industry watchers said AMD has been consistently able to deliver its fastest chips in higher volumes than Intel. Analysts caution, however, that there are limits to how much business AMD can grab. "In the end result, it doesn't make a lot of difference, because AMD has exactly two factories, and Intel has many more," said International Data Corp. analyst Roger Kay. "No matter what AMD does, it can't turn around and supplant Intel. On the other hand, they can get some share with the disgruntled." AMD remains on track to ship 3.6 million Athlon and Duron processors this quarter and still plans to ship 7.2 million of the processors in the fourth quarter, its target before the latest Intel misstep, said company spokesman John Greenagel.  Intel production problems over the past year: August 28Intel says it is recalling its fastest Pentium III, the 1.13-GHz Pentium III, because of potentially faulty circuits. July 2000Intel says the first revenue from its high-end Itanium chip will come later than expected. A week earlier, Intel said most of the initial chips will ship at 733 MHz instead of the planned 800 MHz. May 2000 Intel recalls more than 1 million motherboards using its 820 chipset because of a faulty chip called the "memory translator hub" (MTH). The recall cost the company some $200 million. April 2000Intel says it has underestimated PC demand for the first half of the year and will continue to have problems supplying as many processors as computer makers want. February 2000 Intel discovers a bug that affects some server and workstation computers using Intel 840 and 820 chipsets. Though the glitch is rare, three motherboard designs are canceled in response. September 1999Intel delays the release of its 820 chipset because of problems connecting to Rambus-based memory. Compiled by: Ian Fried and Cecily Barnes "There may be some upside," Greenagel said. AMD is increasing its production rapidly but may not be able to get more Athlon-based computers on shelves than it had initially planned. "While we would have additional capacity, it puts a strain on our infrastructure to supply chipsets and motherboards," he said. Unlike older AMD chips, the Athlon is not compatible with Intel motherboards, meaning computer makers wanting to switch would have to design entirely new systems. Prudential Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann said Intel's latest glitch may give AMD some bragging rights but won't change the bottom line for either company. Even the incremental hit to Intel's image is probably minimal, he argued. "Their brand has been a little tarnished over the past year," Mosesmann said, but he noted that most in the industry knew that the architecture of the Pentium III was on its last legs. Mosesmann said the problems highlight the need for Intel to execute flawlessly on the Pentium 4. "It is important for Intel to be perceived as the leader," he said. ABN Amro analyst David Wu said Intel needs to make sure that it can continue to manufacture the Pentium III in volume because the Pentium 4 will be too expensive for the mainstream market for most of next year. But Wu said Intel should be able to produce Pentium IIIs at up to 1.4 GHz once it shifts to an even thinner 0.13-micron manufacturing process in the middle of next year. The thinner wiring allows the same design to operate at a quicker clock speed. AMD's Greenagel said it is the competition that is revealing Intel's vulnerability. "I'm sure Intel has had problems in the past," Greenagel said. "They've never been visible because they haven't had anyone nipping at their heels." News.com's Joe Wilcox and Cecily Barnes contributed to this report.;

2002-01-02 - Servers workstations beat PC sales slump

Article:
The buying slowdown that pummeled PC sales during the fourth quarter bypassed higher-margin systems, analysts say. Dataquest on Monday reported worldwide server shipments rose 21 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, while workstations posted a more modest 11.3 percent gain. Servers tied notebooks, which also beat the sales slowdown. This compares with fairly dismal PC shipments, which had, until midyear, posted strong double-digit growth. During the fourth quarter, Dataquest put worldwide PC shipments up a paltry 1.6 percent. For 2000, IDC concluded PC shipments grew only 0.3 percent over the previous year. Server shipments rose 14 percent year over year and workstations rose 11 percent during 2000, Dataquest concluded. Worldwide server shipments reached 3.9 million for the year, with 1.1 million units going out in the fourth quarter alone. Servers soar The U.S. server market plowed past the economic slowdown, with 32 percent growth during the fourth quarter 2000 over the same period a year earlier. "Most of the growth in the United States has been fueled by e-business and a resulting demand for front-end Web, Web application and database servers," Dataquest analyst Jeffrey Hewitt said in a statement. Sun Microsystems and Dell Computer saw phenomenal server growth--61.2 percent and 42.2 percent, respectively--last year compared with 1999. Compaq Computer, the volume mover, passed the 1 million mark for the first time. Compaq led the worldwide server market in 2000, with 27.1 percent market share, down from 28 percent a year earlier. Compaq server shipments rose 10.7 percent from 1999. IBM captured a far-distant second place, with 16.7 percent, down from 17.3 percent a year earlier, and 10.8 percent growth. Compaq shipped nearly 1.1 million servers in the quarter compared to IBM's around 658,000 units. Third-ranked Dell, with 14.6 percent market share, shipped about 573,000 servers last year. Hewlett-Packard saw modest growth of 4.2 percent and a decline in market share: 11.2 percent from 12.3 percent a year earlier. HP shipped about 440,000 servers. Palo, Alto, Calif.-based Sun pulled up the rear, gaining market share--7.3 percent from 5.2 percent in 1999--and shipping nearly 287,000 servers. Dataquest also noted that component shortages affecting supply in earlier quarters had virtually disappeared in the Intel-based server market. Still, the server sales situation is not all rosy. Market leader Compaq reported sales of its Intel-based ProLiant servers grew only about 25 percent during the fourth quarter, down from more than 40 percent growth the two previous quarters. This could indicate a slowing sales trend for the overall market. "Because of the length of typical server purchase cycles, the next two quarters will be critical in assessing the impact of the current economic situation on the server market," Hewitt said. No. 2 IBM is navigating an important product transition as it rebrands its server line and starts selling the long-awaiting G7 mainframe. At the same time, a crippling shortage of ceramics used in chips has prevented the Armonk, N.Y.-based company from meeting demand for some of its most profitable, high-performance systems. Workstation wrinkle Round Rock, Texas-based Dell, for the first time, pushed ahead of Sun in workstation shipments: 382,000 units to 357,000. Dell captured 23.1 percent of the market, up from 16 percent in 1999, with whopping 60.3 percent growth. Sun's share rose slightly--21.7 percent compared with the previous year's 21.6 percent--to 11.3 percent growth. HP fell to third place as the company continued its workstation decline, down 7.2 percent from 1999 with shipments of about 290,000 units. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company's market share dropped to 17.5 percent from 20.9 percent a year earlier. Compaq shipped about 230,000 workstations, for growth of 10.6 percent. But the Houston-based PC maker's share declined slightly year over year to 13.9 percent from 14 percent. IBM fell to fifth from fourth place, with 176,000 unit shipments--down 19.1 percent from a year earlier. The company's market share plummeted to 10.7 percent from 14.6 percent in 1999. Combined, computer manufacturers shipped 1.6 million workstations in 2000, Dataquest concluded. For the fourth quarter, the segments 11.3 percent growth rebounded from a weak third quarter, when workstation shipments grew a modest 3.9 percent. Workstations differ from PCs in a number of areas, the most important being two-processor capability. While not a mandatory facet of the category, the capability of using a second processor has been a distinguishing feature. Workstations also tend to offer beefier graphics, support for two monitors and more robust storage offerings, such as SCSI or RAID. The systems are typically used for demanding tasks, such as computer aided design (CAD), software development or video production, among others. Dataquest concluded that the introduction of the Pentium 4 processor, which offers enhanced audio and multimedia performance, could be a boost for the workstation market. But because Intel introduced Pentium 4 late in the fourth quarter, "the shipments were only in the hundreds," Dataquest analyst Pia Rieppo said in a statement. While Dataquest expects Pentium 4 sales to pick up during the first half, one defect could hurt sales: Intel does not yet offer chipsets enabling multi-processor Pentium 4 systems. This represents "a significant change in product positioning since dual processor scalability is a key component of current IA workstation definition," Rieppo said. She concluded that, "many end users may bypass these workstations and wait until the dual-processor chipsets and the Pentium 4 Xeon CPU arrives this spring." Clouds cover Dataquest warned that workstation sales in the United States, which accounts for more than half of shipments, could be weak during early 2001 because of the Pentium 4 situation, socioeconomic conditions and other factors. Overall, a dark cloud hangs over workstation and server sales during 2001: two important product transitions coming later in the year. Intel around midyear is expected to release its long-anticipated and much-delayed Itanium processors, which will be used in servers and workstations. Typically, pending new products slow or stall sales. IBM, for example, saw S/390 mainframe sales plummet 24 percent during the third quarter in anticipation of the z900 server. Big Blue shipped the server in mid December. More troubling may be the release of Microsoft's next version of Windows, code-named Whistler. The new operating system, rumored to be called Windows XP, won't come out until several months after Itanium's release. While Microsoft plans an interim 64-bit version of Windows 2000 for Itanium, the operating system confusion could conceivably hurt workstation and server shipments during the second half.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - The week in review Linux ever upward

Article:
Just as Comdex used to bring the PC world together, so it seems a New York trade show is becoming a focal point for Linux adherents and their ever-expanding initiatives. The startling buyout of a Linux media site that went public only two months ago and IBM's decision to incorporate the open-source software in one of its mainframe systems topped a busy week at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo. The gathering has grown rapidly in tandem with the widespread adoption of Linux, a clone of the Unix operating system and a competitor to Microsoft's Windows NT.Big deal Surprising everyone, VA Linux, which sells computers and services, acquired news and information site Andover.Net for more than $800 million, bolstering its efforts to lure corporate customers. VA hopes developers visiting Andover.Net for information will be steered toward buying VA's products. The agreement was negotiated within the space of a few weeks, according to VA's chief executive. But the speed at which Andover.Net moved from IPO to takeover target amazed even industry veterans. "This is unprecedented," one financial analyst said. "That deal went public a couple months ago and already they're tossing in the towel." In another landmark development, IBM previewed a multi-million dollar system running nominally free software. As part of its S/390 mainframe, Linux could be utilized by companies as big as Salomon Smith Barney or Schwab to speed up and better secure business processes ordinarily handled by smaller servers, Big Blue contends. Separately, a coalition called the Trillian project--including IBM, SGI and such leading commercial developers as Red Hat--released a version of Linux that works on Intel's next-generation microprocessors. The upstart operating system has much to gain from the 64-bit Itanium; however, Linux is new to the high-end market and Itanium isn't expected until the second half of the year, so it's not clear whether this will expand Linux's stronghold on 32-bit Intel chips. Meanwhile, Compaq announced new efforts to support Linux on its 64-bit Alpha chip platform. A bit lower on the food chain, "skinny" servers stacked up by the dozen are rapidly becoming the preferred way for PC companies to squeeze profits out of the popularity of Linux. Relatively low cost, high reliability and network-friendliness make the software a good choice for businesses that need lots of servers to handle tasks such as delivering Web pages or funneling requests to a back-end database. SGI, IBM, Penguin Computing and Network Engines, among others, announced new products that fit the mold.At last Vodafone AirTouch agreed to buy Mannesmann in a stock swap valued at $190.5 billion. The agreement ends Vodafone's three-month campaign for control of Germany's largest cellular company and makes it Europe's biggest phone business. If it goes through, the biggest takeover in history, surpassing America Online's pending $154.8 billion acquisition of Time Warner, would create a company with more than 42 million cellular customers. With about 10 percent of the world's mobile phone customers, the group could also dominate mobile Internet services. Qualcomm agreed to license its wireless voice and data transmission technology to China Unicom, the country's second-largest government-owned communications company, clearing the way for its CDMA standard to break into a lucrative market. The pact marks a significant win for CDMA, which has gained among North American carriers drawn to its efficient use of wireless spectrum and ability to carry data and Internet traffic at high speeds, but badly trailed the rival GSM standard in China, much of the rest of Asia, and Europe. Microsoft is negotiating distribution deals with Sprint PCS, AirTouch and others to boost its technology in the rapidly expanding market for wireless devices. The telecommunications companies would deliver a new version of Microsoft's Internet content service, dubbed MSN Mobile 2.0. Mobile MSN, launched last summer, pushes Net content such as news and sports scores to pagers and cell phones. Intel landed a deal to sell as much as $1.5 billion in flash memory chips to cellular phone maker Ericsson over the next three years, and the companies will co-develop flash products capable of storing code and data such as Web pages, email, voice and music. Both companies are looking to be part of future network services offering voice and Internet capabilities in wireless handheld devices.Expansion Gateway will expand its foreign marketing and sales efforts in the coming year, beginning by moving into Canada this month. A launch into Mexico will come later in 2000, according to executives. The move complements Gateway's transformation from PC manufacturing to providing more-complete technology packages incorporating software, training courses, ISP services and even networking equipment. PC makers in general are trying to counter the decline of computer prices. Flextronics, which manufactures PCs, servers and consumer devices for name-brand companies, bought Palo Alto Products, a design firm that helped create such popular products as 3Com's PalmPilot and some of the small, "designer" PCs that have recently emerged. Should the merger prove successful--and the "contract manufacturing" business continue to grow as it has--the PC market could be encouraged to divide into two camps: unknown companies such as Flextronics that actually make products and well-known firms such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard that focus on marketing and sales. Free-PC, which offered free computers and Net access to customers willing to accept on-screen advertising, wrapped up business after giving away some 25,000 systems. The company recently merged with low-cost leader Emachines, both of them having been at the forefront of the price war which transformed the consumer PC market. Customers who signed up for the deal and received a PC get to keep it, no strings attached, although the free Net service will end.The next step Traditional business software makers and emerging applications service providers are squaring off in the market for hosted software services. Oracle, SAP and PeopleSoft--expected to launch its own ASP next month--are building quickly for the same reason that telecommunications giants such as AT&T are investing in hosting centers that will house rented business applications: to nab new profits by providing customers with new Net-based services. KPMG incorporated its consulting unit, the first step toward a public offering. Such a move could serve as a litmus test for rivals Deloitte & Touche, Andersen Consulting, Pricewaterhouse Coopers and Ernst & Young. All of the "Big 5" accounting/auditing firms operate consulting practices that are struggling to find their place in the new Net economy, having lost executives to Internet start-ups offering lucrative option packages. An IPO could also build the company's image as a firm that can transform a Fortune 500 company's business into a Net play. Time Warner may be facing an early exodus of top executives who instantly became eligible to cash in all their stock options under an unusual but long-standing provision that took effect upon last month's takeover announcement by America Online. Employees with previously unvested options won't have to wait for the merger to officially close before exercising them. They can do so now. Amazon.com posted a wider-than-expected loss for the latest quarter but said its U.S. book business made money. Analysts had been watching to see whether the retail leader could turn a profit in its flagship segment, as it promised last year. But Amazon said it will continue expanding, and expects the current quarter's sales to be down from its fourth-quarter revenues because of the seasonal nature of Amazon's toys and consumer electronics businesses. Should that happen, it would mark the first time Amazon's sales have slumped on a sequential basis.Unhappiness A consumer advocacy group organized a protest against DoubleClick, encouraging the public to email complaints about the online marketing giant's privacy policies to the company and 60 leading clients. The Center for Democracy and Technology objects to plans to create a database of consumer profiles that would include each user's name and address; retail, catalog and online purchase history; and demographic data. In an email response, the company said it does not profile "health information, detailed financial information, information of a sexual nature and information on children" and will not link "personally identifiable information about a user to online behavior without first giving that user notice and the choice not to participate." Bulk email advertising--spam--is undergoing a quiet transformation as direct marketers implement more sophisticated techniques for better targeting messages to people who may actually want to see them. Advertisers have sought to gain permission from consumers before sending pitches, which has allowed them to tailor advertisements to an individual's preferences with impressive results. The industry has a long, long way to go in gaining the trust of email users, however. Students on university campuses that have banned Napster gained hope for circumventing blocked network access. After riling the software maker by posting instructions on how the controversial digital-music download system works, a Stanford University student published a tutorial for getting around school roadblocks. The music industry dislikes Napster because it says it fosters a black market; schools say it hogs bandwidth. Again bowing to pressure, eBay said it will ban new auctions of items that promote such groups as the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nation. Current listings will remain, however, and the online auctioneer will continue to allow items of "legitimate collectible" value, which must be at least 50 years old. Last year, eBay came under scrutiny for Nazi items. A trade group sued Sony Music Entertainment, alleging that the company is strong-arming retailers to point their customers toward its online shops. Brick-and-mortar chains are forced to stock CDs that contain Web links and include promotional material for Sony's e-commerce sites, according to the complaint. Giant Sony is a content company, CD distributor and e-tailer.Also of note Palm Computing cut prices in preparation for the release of new models, including its first color handheld...The Justice Department closed its antitrust investigation of Network Solutions without taking any action against the dominant domain registrar...Separately, the DOJ queried eBay about its efforts to block third-party auction search engines from accessing items listed for sale...A $2 billion White House plan to protect telecommunications, energy and other key systems from attack relies too much on detecting intrusions and not enough on improving security, said the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm...USA Networks and the National Basketball Association unveiled a cross-marketing relationship to sell and market NBA merchandise through USA Networks' e-commerce, television and customer service properties.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Intel takes on Sun with telecom servers

Article:
Intel, looking for new sources of revenue, will challenge Sun Microsystems by launching a line of telecommunications servers later this year. On Thursday Intel announced plans to build telecommunications servers and sell them via PC makers or telecommunications-equipment companies. Intel said the move will challenge Sun, which enjoys a healthy telecommunications-server business. The move is reminiscent of Intel's earlier moves into the high-end workstation market, where Sun is also a major player. The telecommunications thrust is classic Intel: Attack an established competitor in a new market with large numbers of inexpensive computers offering "twice the performance for half the price," said Abhi Talawalker, vice president and general manager of Intel's Enterprise Platforms and Services Division. "One of the areas where we have not been very active has been in the telecommunications and communications space," Talawalker said. The new server products "are responding to a decent amount of interest (Intel has seen) over the past few years" from customers in that market. Intel will not sell the servers directly to telecommunications customers. Following a model the company established with its network-appliance systems, Intel will sell the servers to PC makers and to telecommunications-equipment companies, which will then add operating systems and applications and resell them to customers. In 1997, Intel launched an effort to break into the workstation market. The company signed up PC makers to build workstations that would challenge the machines sold by Sun and Silicon Graphics, which at the time offered a high-end workstation based on its own processor. Known as NT workstations after Windows NT, the machines were initially more like high-end PCs and could not match the performance of a Unix workstation. However, the NT workstation took off in market share thanks to its lower price, sometimes less than one-third of that of a Unix workstation. PCs out, servers in Success in the telecommunications market would also mean a healthy boost to Intel's bottom line. While PC margins continue to shrink, servers are still commanding relatively high prices. Analysts said on Thursday that Intel could make inroads with its new servers in areas where companies are looking to expand--such as wireless--but only if the company can meet the stringent requirements of telecommunications customers. Cost is not the only thing telecommunications companies evaluate when they choose new servers. Intel will also need to demonstrate that it can offer reliability, analysts said. Telecom companies may also consider the ease of upgrading servers as well as their overall cost to maintain before buying. Many companies keep equipment for as long as five to 10 years. Executives from Sun agreed that building telecommunications servers consists of more than assembling hardware or hitting a low price. Sun introduced its first NEBS certified telecommunications server, the Netra, in 1999. Executives at the company believe that over the average life of a telecommunications server, which ranges from five to as many as 20 years, the initial price is less important than built-in abilities such as being able to perform a repair or upgrade--adding a faster processor, for example--in the field. "Every component of my Netra CT servers is field replaceable or repairable," said Bret Martin, a group manager inside Sun's Network Equipment Provider Division. "This gives (telecom companies) the ability to increase the horsepower as we move forward (with technology) without changing out the machine again. It's the serviceability, the reparability and the maintainability that separate us." Hewlett-Packard on Thursday announced it would use the new Intel servers in machines aimed at voice and data networks. The companies, in addition, opened a joint "telecommunications solutions center" in Grenoble, France, where much of HP's PC division is based. The center, among other functions, will offer a place for potential Intel server customers to test the new equipment. It will also allow software developers to test their work. Intel plans to begin shipping single- and dual-processor Pentium III-based servers in 1U (1.75 inches high) and 2U chassis in the fourth quarter. The servers will meet telecommunications specifications, such as NEB Class III, which requires that servers be able to withstand conditions such as fire or earthquake. The first servers will be based on Intel's forthcoming 1.13GHz "Tualatin" Pentium III chip. Tualatin is Intel's code name for Pentium III chips manufactured using the company's new 0.13-micron process. Intel plans to follow up on these first telecommunications servers with later servers offering its new Xeon and Itanium processors.;

2002-01-02 - Linux-on-Itanium effort gets more backing

Article:
A coalition of firms aiming to make the Linux operating system work on Intel's upcoming Itanium chip is getting bigger, with the addition of the four biggest Linux sellers, sources said. Leading Linux seller Red Hat won a place in the coalition, dubbed Trillian, when it acquired software development toolmaker Cygnus Solutions in November. Soon it will be joined by Caldera Systems, TurboLinux and SuSE, the three other largest sellers of the Unix-like operating system, sources familiar with the plan said. The Trillian project is a big factor in the future success of Linux, as companies try to push the operating system to the loftier position occupied by the closely related Unix operating system. Though Linux runs on several 64-bit chips, such as the UltraSparc from Sun Microsystems, the Alpha from Compaq and the PA-RISC from Hewlett-Packard, the Linux stronghold today is on 32-bit chips from Intel. The Linux operating system is particularly popular in servers and many see it as competing both with Windows and Unix. It was developed by Linus Torvalds and countless other programmers and has made its way into the product lines of the world's biggest computing companies. The Itanium is Intel's first 64-bit processor in its IA-64 family and the spearhead of its effort to take on the high-end chips from Sun Microsystems and others. Moving to a 64-bit architecture means the computer can deal with much larger amounts of memory and much larger databases, two important features for big businesses. Trillian members currently are chiefly hardware companies: Intel, VA Linux Systems, SGI, HP and IBM. The other two members are the European Laboratory for Particle Physics and Cygnus, which writes the software that translates programs written by people into instructions a computer can understand. Adding the software companies means the effort will be broadened to include the companies who actually will sell products based on Trillian. The development of Trillian currently is happening behind closed doors, a contrast to the usual methods of open-source programming. But the results of the effort will be shared midway through the first quarter of 2000--likely February--when Intel will release the participating companies from their nondisclosure agreements, said Ron Curry, leader of IA-64 marketing at Intel. Intel wants to see as many operating systems as possible succeed on its IA-64 chip. The company has invested in Red Hat, TurboLinux and SuSE. Caldera Systems confirmed its participation in the Trillian project. "We've already allocated resources. We're excited to be on this project," said Caldera Systems' Benoy Tamang. "It's necessary in order for us to maintain our own momentum and keep up with the new archtitecture. We believe strongly that the Merced [the code name for Itanium] version of Linux will be just critical." Intel versions of Caldera Systems software account for more than 90 percent of revenues, Tamang said. Intel declined to comment on the new partners. SuSE also confirmed its participation in Trillian. "All the primary Linux distributors have agreements in place with Intel to get the early release of the chips so we can have distributions ready in time for the primary launch," said Marc Torres, president of the U.S. branch of SuSE, which is based in Germany. Linux, which already runs on many different chips, is relatively easy to transfer from one type to another because the chip-specific sections are isolated in a separate section and the bulk of the software doesn't have to be changed, Torres said. TurboLinux chief executive Cliff Miller declined to comment on the specifics of the Trillian project and Red Hat representatives were not immediately available for comment. "We work very closely with Intel on several things, but we're unfortunately not able to talk about the Trillian project," Miller said in an interview. However, he said Trillian and the IA-64 chips will increase the Linux muscle. "Right now if you want 64-bit power, you go to other hardware platforms, which tend not to be commodity hardware," he said. Though versions of Unix from HP, Sun and IBM will be available on IA-64, Miller predicted that Linux would lead the way. "With a company like Intel behind getting these commodity boxes with 64-bit processing power, you're going to see some pretty fierce competition in the server market. I think you'll see Linux really leading that drive on the Intel platform for these servers," Miller said. Intel has begun shipping hundreds of prototype Itanium computers and chips to hardware companies, the company said.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Coalition says Linux ready for Intel's upcoming chips

Article:
NEW YORK--A Linux coalition called the Trillian project has publicly released a version of the operating system that works on Intel's next-generation microprocessors. The software now is available to anyone, not just the select few from a handful of companies that currently have worked on the Trillian project, executives at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo said here today. The Trillian effort began two years ago with David Mosberger's work at HP, the company that developed the architecture used in the upcoming 64-bit Itanium chip. Now the effort has expanded to include IBM, SGI, VA Linux Systems, Intel, Red Hat, Caldera Systems, SuSE, TurboLinux, CERN and Cygnus Solutions, a company acquired by Red Hat. In addition, representatives from the four biggest sellers of Linux said they will ship versions of their software as soon as systems built with the Itanium chip ships--currently expected in the second half of the year. These companies joined Trillian in December and now have some of relatively scarce prototype Itanium-based computers. Linux has much to gain from Itanium and the future members of Intel's IA-64 family that could help carry Linux into higher-end servers. However, Linux is young in this high-end market, and Itanium is even younger, so it's not clear how quickly the new systems will take over from the current Linux stronghold on 32-bit Intel chips. Even though very few have access to the few hundred Itanium machines, ordinary people will be able to help in the Trillian effort soon. In two weeks at the Intel Developer's Forum, the programming tools to write software for the Itanium chips will be available, meaning that people will be able to see if their software translates to the IA-64 chip even if they don't have an Itanium computer. Linux, a clone of Unix and competitor to Windows, is different from those better-established operating systems because its original programming instructions are freely available and the software itself is developed by several companies as well as numerous individuals. This strategy is called open-source development. However, marrying open source development to the proprietary constraints of a still-unreleased chip design was awkward, said Ron Curry of Intel. "This is somewhat of a new environment for the Linux development to occur," Curry said. In some ways, "Linux is just catching up to the way other operating system developers have code for new processor products. It's a lot easier to go talk to (Sun) or Microsoft four years before the product and put a non-disclosure agreement in place." Awkward, perhaps, but the strategy has worked, said HP's Mosberger. "I think it is living proof that it is possible to have competing companies work together and produce open source in the way open source was meant to be developed," Mosberger said. The Itanium chip will enable Intel to sell chips for a category of more powerful, more expensive servers that currently are powered by chips from IBM, Compaq, Sun Microsystems and SGI. Linux companies soared on the news, lead by VA Linux and Red Hat. At 1 p.m. PST, the close of regular trading, VA Linux was up $29 to $136.88, a 26.88 percent gain. Red Hat was up $15.50 to $108, a 16.76 percent gain. Itanium will enable faster mathematical calculations than current chips, so many companies expect the Itanium to be popular with scientific and technical users. The European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland, one of the Trillian members, has been working on software modules that will make mathematical calculations run well on Itanium, and Hewlett-Packard has been helping to fund the effort, said Mike Balma, leader of HP's Open Source Solutions Operation. Newer chips from Intel also will boost math performance. The "Foster" chip, due later this year, will be cheaper than Itanium but more powerful than current Pentium chips. Markus Rex, development director of Linux seller SuSE, is one of the lucky few to have an Itanium machine. He described it in one word: "Loud." The prototype machine has lots of fans to keep it cool, and therefore is sufficiently noisy enough that he quickly moved it from his office to the server room. Microsoft also is working on a new version of Windows that will work on Itanium. That version is expected to be ready at the launch of Itanium systems. By the end of June, Intel expects to have thousands of IA-64 prototype machines out, Curry said.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Intel to aim Itanium at tough IT crowd

Article:
Intel, in the midst of a stagnant market for new PCs, will use a technology show next week in New York to drum up interest in its powerful new processors. At next week's TechX NY trade show, formerly called PC Expo, the chip giant will lay out plans to ship a handful of new technologies in the coming months, according to Intel Executive Vice President Michael Splinter. Splinter will deliver a speech at the show Wednesday morning in an attempt to sway reluctant information-technology buyers by highlighting the processing power, and relative low price, of new servers based on the company's Itanium chip. Splinter will discuss Intel's newest products, including Itanium and the new Pentium III "Tualatin" chips, and may preview a pair of new Pentium 4 chips, expected next month. Despite the slow market for PCs and other computing and communications equipment, the chipmaker has launched a slew of products in the past two months. The keynote speech, intended to rally the IT audience behind Intel's chip strategy, comes at a critical time for the company. Intel, along with rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Transmeta, is suffering through a slowing PC market. Intel's processor shipments plunged 20 percent in the first quarter, compared with last year, and second-quarter shipments will be flat at best, Dan Niles, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, wrote in a report issued Wednesday. PC shipments were down 14 percent in the first quarter and are expected to drop 5 percent to 7 percent in the second quarter, Niles wrote. Niles cut his earnings-per-share estimates for both Intel and rival AMD due to "a continuing deterioration in demand for PCs," among other reasons. Other chipmakers are feeling the effects of a slowing market. On Thursday, Transmeta, which makes microprocessors for notebook computers and Internet appliances, said second-quarter revenue will be down 40 percent to 45 percent from revenue of $18.6 million for the first quarter of 2001. Intel CEO Craig Barrett said Wednesday that the company needs to see a recovery in the chip market within six months or it will consider cutting capacity and investments next year. The company is encountering some of its toughest competition from rival AMD. At TechX NY next week, AMD also will pitch IT managers on processors designed for business. The company is expected to tout its dual Athlon processor strategy for workstations and servers. AMD announced its dual-processor products earlier this month. Splinter is expected to woo buyers at the trade show by highlighting Intel's new chips in virtually every area of the PC business, from mini-notebooks to servers. The company intends to continue to invest in this strategy and the processors behind it to show its commitment to the business market, Splinter is expected to say. The Intel vice president also will demonstrate the Itanium chip for business users and will discuss customers that have plans to install servers using the chip. The 64-bit processor, launched in late May, is aimed squarely at the business market and was designed to offer greater performance than current Intel server offerings but lower prices than some of the large servers sold by companies such as Sun Microsystems. "What we are trying to do is bring the economics (of the PC) to the enterprise" with Itanium, Splinter told CNET News.com. IT managers "are the ones that we want to get a clear understanding of what we are bringing," he said. Intel will pull its chip offerings together "to show where we are and how serious we are about the space." One of the more important products for Intel will be the Tualatin Pentium III. Splinter is expected to confirm that Intel has been shipping this chip, manufactured with Intel's newest 0.13-micron manufacturing technology, since May. The chips that have been shipping are production-level processors, meant to stock customers with inventory. "We're not just playing around," Splinter said. Tualatins will come in a variety of forms. The first will be mobile processors. Intel will discuss these chips in a press conference Tuesday afternoon at the show. The company is expected to discuss the frequencies and low-power properties of the chips, as well as the launching of a new mini-notebook from Compaq Computer. The official Tualatin launch is expected in late July. The new Pentium III chips will also be available for desktop PCs and servers. "For ultradense servers, it is really a great product," Splinter said. "It will find its way into the desktop." However, "for the desktop, Pentium 4 is really the product," he added. Meanwhile, Splinter hinted that he might also discuss a pair of new Pentium 4 chips. As previously reported, Intel is expected to launch a 1.6GHz and a 1.8GHz version of the chip in early July. "I'll talk a little bit about Pentium 4," Splinter said. "I might touch on that.";

2002-01-02 - Commentary Good news for Windows shops

Article:
Compaq Computer has struggled to bring appropriate focus to its diverse businesses ever since it bought Digital Equipment and Tandem. If its announcement to place more emphasis on See news story: Compaq narrows server-chip competition software and services indicates that senior management is finally making the hard decisions it has so far avoided--particularly about what to spin off and what to keep--then this is a good sign for Compaq. If not, the company will continue to drift. A stronger focus on services by Compaq could benefit end users with large Windows environments and global support needs. Compaq is one of the world's largest and best Microsoft Exchange design and installation shops, with impressive references worldwide. Exactly what Compaq intends by refocusing on services and software is still unclear. However, we do not expect the company to start buying business applications--for instance, a CRM (customer relationship management) software vendor--and enter the application package market. Rather, we think it will look at middleware, storage management, systems management, asset management and messaging capabilities to augment its services and systems management offerings. We also expect Compaq to continue to aggressively partner with business application vendors, such as Siebel Systems. To support these application projects and differentiate its offerings, Compaq is likely to prepackage bundles of services, integration software, systems management capabilities and hardware around these business applications. The hazards of the game However, Compaq faces several dangers with this shift in emphasis. First, when all is said and done, Compaq will be an Intel-based hardware vendor, supporting primarily Windows along with Tru64, which we expect it to port to and make available on both Alpha and Intel's 64-bit chips--Itanium in the near term, McKinley in the longer term. With this reality in mind, Compaq must succeed in the Intel-based hardware market. This means that it must be able to position itself against both the high-end players such as IBM and more cost-conscious competitors such as Dell Computer. Both IBM and Dell have made significant cost-cutting inroads on their Intel-based systems, which Compaq must beat--or at least match. Second, Compaq must avoid competing with its larger resellers, many of which provide their own services to customers as part of their packages. When defining services, Compaq must consider partnerships in providing services and hardware with the application vendor, as it will struggle to appear platform-neutral and merely to be pushing hardware. Desktop services have been a struggle for the company in non-Compaq shops. Third, Compaq must avoid fragmentation. If the company ends up dividing into several stovepipe organizations, each focused on a vertical market, this will increase the fragmentation that already prevents it from focusing effectively on any one strategy. Overall, Compaq should not count on services to specific verticals to replace the income from server and desktop sales. Instead, it must focus on ways to compete more strongly in those markets. Vertical horizon In the past two decades, several hardware companies that have run into trouble in the market have retreated and stated that they would refocus on specific vertical industries and on providing services. IBM succeeded at this strategy, while other companies--including Digital and Unisys--have found it a recipe for creating a smaller company. Compaq must be careful that it does not fall into this trap. For Intel, the purchase of Compaq's Alpha processor operation makes sense. Although the Alpha market itself is fading, Intel will gain additional patents as well as some strong engineering talent. We recommend that Alpha users evaluate Itanium in its first release to set up a migration strategy before the transition from EV6 to EV7. They should then consider a route to Itanium McKinley-based servers from Alpha by the end of 2002 and complete the transition by the end of 2003. Organizations with large Windows installations should watch Compaq's services offerings carefully. To the extent that Compaq is serious about competing more effectively with IBM and other major services providers, its natural market is in integrating large NT-based systems, where it is one of the market leaders. Compaq has built several of the largest Exchange systems worldwide. To expand its presence in the services arena, Compaq may be willing to offer those services at a cut-rate price to gain entries into companies and markets where it does not now have a strong presence.

2002-01-02 - Microsoft cues up test of high-end Windows

Article:
Microsoft on Wednesday announced that a long-awaited high-end version of its Windows XP operating system, intended to compete with Unix, is entering customer testing. Microsoft announced two versions: 64-bit Windows Advanced Server Limited Edition for servers and Windows XP 64-Bit Edition for workstations. The 64-bit versions of Windows will be made available on a limited basis, bundled with systems using Intel's Itanium processor. Itanium, Intel's long-anticipated and much-delayed successor to the Pentium processor, will move computers to a 64-bit architecture from 32-bit. New 64-bit systems can accomplish roughly double the amount of work as 32-bit systems in a given amount of time. Major computer manufacturers including Compaq Computer, Dell Computer, Hewlett-Packard and IBM have shown off early versions of Itanium systems in the last couple of months. While both 64-bit operating systems are technically test, or beta, versions, Microsoft in an unusual move will provide product support for both, said Michael Stephenson, Windows 2002 Server product manager. Customers also will receive free upgrades to the final versions when they are available. For Microsoft, the early test version of 64-bit Windows is a milestone, as the company also prepares for the launch of 32-bit Windows XP. Both the 32-bit and 64-bit desktop versions of Windows XP will ship Oct. 25. Greg Sullivan, Windows XP product manager, made it clear that 64-bit computing is not for everyone. But for those who need the computing power required of the architecture, their choices are limited to fairly expensive alternatives. "We basically will take the economics of the PC model, the experience we have in mobilizing high-volume hardware manufacturers, software vendors and device manufacturers, and apply that to this very high-end technical computing space," he said. More importantly, it clears the way for the Redmond, Wash.-based company to cue up for testing its 64-bit applications, such as its SQL Server database. "We do have plans to make a 64-bit version of SQL Server available. A beta version will ship this summer, and a final release will happen shortly after we launch the Whistler server family," Stephenson said. The server operating system launch is slated for early 2002.Forrester Research analyst Carl Howe said Microsoft has done well to finally clarify uncertainties about its 64-bit Windows plans. "One of the challenges for Microsoft has been trying to stay on top of the ever slipping Itanium schedule, because frankly, a few months makes a huge difference in how they position this." At one point, Microsoft had considered releasing a 64-bit version of Windows 2000 Professional that would be available for just a few months preceding the Windows XP version. But Itanium's dimmed future as a production chip helped Microsoft back away from that strategy and go strictly for Windows XP, analysts say. The 64-bit Windows XP and Advanced Server betas are crucial for Intel's setting the stage for successor chip McKinley, said Gartner analyst Michael Silver. "Intel wants to get people on Itanium now and testing so that when 64-bit becomes a more useful platform, they're ready for it," he said. "They need to start to get developers working on 64-bit applications. This is where the real work starts." Itanium and computers containing it will compete against more expensive Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) servers and workstations running Unix. Those systems are sold by Sun Microsystems, IBM and other makers. The release of the 64-bit beta is as important for Microsoft as for Intel, said Guernsey Research analyst Chris LeTocq "From a revenue perspective it is probably insignificant, but from a credibility's standpoint it is important," he said. "Having a 64-bit OS out there and being able to sway with the big boys, that's significant." Stephenson said Microsoft has been working with Intel for about five years to deliver a 64-bit operating system. "We're still in the phase of working with (PC makers) to do early customer evaluations, and we're still working with software developers to get applications ready," he said. Microsoft has identified about 300 applications being developed for Intel 64-bit processors. Although Itanium has long been anticipated, its arrival may be muted, despite the availability of 64-bit Windows XP. Intel on Wednesday acknowledged that the chip, which initially will be used in PC workstations and servers, and telecommunications servers, is merely a way station to its successor, McKinley, due next year. "This is just a shakedown cruise to make sure 64-bit is ready for prime time," Howe said. "This is a far cry from what everybody expected--turning it into a development--but it's also fairly realistic. This is not for widespread adoption. This is not a system for which you should be planning to run Oracle this year." While Linux and other operating systems will also be available for Itanium, Intel is banking on Windows and its huge market share to drive sales, analysts say. "Intel really wants a Microsoft OS to run on Itanium," Silver said. With 64-bit versions of Linux also available, "Microsoft doesn't want to not be on the platform with Unix variants out there for Itanium." Beyond testing, real-world use may have to wait until 64-bit applications reach the market. The problem is a lack of applications, analysts say. "Right now, if it's an OS without apps, what good is it?" Silver asked. "Even though 32-bit apps run, it's not something you don't want to do." While Itanium will run 32-bit applications in emulation mode--a way of simulating older processors--testers report unsatisfactory performance. "You use this in 32-bit emulation and you're going to be underimpressed," Howe said. With the delivery of 64-bit Windows XP and Advanced Server, computer makers can finally start selling Itanium-based systems, which initially are expected to be used for more demanding applications. Dell on Tuesday launched its first Itanium server, the PowerEdge 7150, which will be available by August. Gartner predicts that initial 64-bit system adoption will be on servers. "We won't see it as mainstream on the desktop until 2006, 2007," Silver said. But for PC makers hoping to sell Itanium systems this year, the repositioning "is clearly going to be a disappointment for them," Howe said. "They were hoping it was going to rev up their sales. Saying it's a development is not the message they want their customers to hear.";

Title:
2002-01-02 - Linux explodes onto the scene

Article:
In the 12 months of 1999, Linux rose from obscurity to overexposure. The year began with a bang for the upstart operating system. In January, IBM, Compaq Computer, Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard started selling systems designed for use with Linux. And the pace didn't let up. By the end of the year, four successful Linux-related initial public offerings raised hundreds of millions of dollars, at least three executives became paper billionaires and the operating system had grown from a counterculture hobby into a corporate mainstay. Linux is a modern-day clone of the Unix operating system born decades ago. It began as a project on Linus Torvalds' computer in 1991 and since then has grown to the point where the biggest computing companies typically either include it in their own product lines or take it seriously as a competitor. Red Hat, the seller of Linux instrumental in fueling this growth, embodies the history of Linux in 1999. Red Hat set the stage in 1998, securing investments from Intel and Netscape. Red Hat then led the first wave of Linux adoption, providing the technical support and a stable point of contact the computing heavyweights needed. In the spring, Red Hat then cemented the legitimacy of Linux by soliciting investments from IBM, Novell, Oracle, Compaq, SAP and Dell. For Matthew Szulik, who took over as Red Hat CEO in November, this was the single biggest event in 1999--bigger even than Red Hat's IPO in August. When the year began, Red Hat had 40 employees. Now, with the acquisition of Cygnus Solutions, Red Hat has grown tenfold to about 410, Szulik said. And some of those employees are crucial. Red Hat snapped up Alan Cox, Stephen Tweedie, David Miller and other programmers at the heart of Linux development. "We were fortunate to have folks like Alan and Stephen choosing to join us way back before it became fashionable, before there was a true value established for the Red Hat stock," Szulik said. Red Hat's IPO raised $84 million, providing serious capital for expansion and further development of Linux. It was followed by Cobalt Networks, Andover.Net and the biggest of them all, VA Linux Systems, which set a record when its stock closed at 698 percent above the IPO price in the first day of trading. None of these companies are making profits as yet. Their strategy is similar to that of the Internet companies that are more famously lacking in profitability: Stake a claim, hold an IPO to gain an unbeatable lead over competitors, then reap the profits at some undetermined point in the future. And, like a number of Net companies, profits eventually will derive not from technological products but from the necessary trappings of technology: advertising or support. Red Hat reported a net loss of $5.2 million for the six-month period ending Aug. 31. VA Linux, which specializes in Linux-tuned hardware, lost $10 million for the quarter ended Oct. 29. Andover.Net lost $5.4 million for the year ended Sept. 30. And Cobalt lost $13 million in the nine months ended Oct. 31. Being unprofitable while paying for expansion is unavoidable. "We're competing against organizations that have been in business for 20-plus years," Szulik said. And he was cagey about when the company will start focusing on profits instead of just revenues. "Our emphasis is going to continue to be on growing the top line.... We will continue to make investments and scale our business and brand." Microsoft probably stands the most to lose from ascendance of Linux. Microsoft set up Windows NT as the server operating system that would take on Unix. But while Windows NT in 1999 benefited only from bug fixes and its successor was delayed, Internet companies revived interest in Unix. And though most agree Linux is still rough around the edges, few deny it has moved ahead rapidly. Linux benefited from upgrades that made it more business-friendly, then improvements aimed at desktop use and visions from Torvalds that the next frontier would come in gadgets. While Red Hat, TurboLinux, SuSE and VA Linux Systems aimed Linux at the server, Corel fulfilled its promise to begin selling a version aimed at the Microsoft desktop stronghold. It even has the potential to be used in the world's fastest supercomputer. The extent of this seriousness is visible in the efforts of the Trillian group, a consortium working to get Linux working on Intel's upcoming 64-bit chips. Where typically Linux has lagged other operating systems that usually were ready for a new chip arrival, the Trillian project, newly beefed up, aims to have a 64-bit Linux for Intel ready by the time the Itanium chip arrives in 2000. Microsoft has been ambivalent toward Linux. In March, a spokesman denied that Linux is a threat, and in April, Microsoft chief executive Bill Gates predicted Linux would have a limited impact. At the same time, however, Microsoft has established and augmented its efforts to study and counter Linux. Microsoft also tried to argue that Linux posed a competitive threat in arguments to a federal judge that Microsoft doesn't hold monopoly power. The judge was unconvinced, though, saying Linux doesn't yet compete in the desktop market where Microsoft is strongest. Linux companies, many of whom are motivated by the possibility of taking Microsoft down a peg, were delighted by the judge's finding that Microsoft is a monopoly. Meanwhile, Linux has been expanding its turf while Windows NT contracts. Since the Windows NT debut, Microsoft has abandoned plans to have it run on Mips, PowerPC, and Compaq Alpha chips, NT now has a future only on Intel processors. Linux has gone the other direction. It began on Intel chips and has expanded to all other major chips with corporate help. Compaq hopes Linux will boost Alpha sales. HP is quietly funding efforts to bring Linux to its own PA-RISC chips. Even Sun Microsystems, a tepid supporter of Linux, has begun selling Red Hat for its UltraSparc-based computers. Intel, though, is among the most aggressive boosters of Linux. It led the field with its investment in Red Hat, and now has invested in Red Hat competitors SuSE and TurboLinux. It invested in hardware makers too, VA Linux Systems in March and eSoft in November. Linux connections have been the Midas touch for companies such as Applix, K-tel and V-One and Corel. But will Linux popularity become too much of a good thing? LinuxOne, which filed its IPO plans in September when its first Linux product just entered beta testing, hopes not. Despite the fact that large sections of its Securities and Exchange Commission filings are identical to similar documents from Red Hat, that it has zero revenue, and that it has sparked continuing animosity from the Linux community, LinuxOne plans to go public as soon as January.;

2002-01-02 - Intel names Merced chip Itanium

Article:
Itanium--think "Titanium" with a slight regional accent--will be the official name of Intel's Merced processor, and the company will provide more details on the chip's microarchitecture at the Microprocessor Forum in San Jose, California, tomorrow. The name Itanium was chosen to "reflect the strength and performance of the processor," said Jami Dover, vice president of marketing at Intel. Sausalito, California-based Lexicon, which also coined the chip names Celeron and Xeon, came up with the name, she said. Itanium, due toward the middle of next year, will be the chipmaker's first 64-bit processor, which means that the chip can process information in 64-bit chunks. Current Intel processors work with 32-bit chunks. The processor will allow Intel to provide the building blocks for servers that compete against the expensive "big iron" servers currently sold by Sun and others. Itanium-based systems will largely be targeted to e-commerce applications and to Internet service providers. Although Intel has not officially released the speed or price of the chip, it will provide details about the internal structure of the chip tomorrow, according to Steve Smith, vice president and general manager of the IA-64 division. If anything, the structure of the chip makes it apparent that the processor will indeed be more powerful than any previous Intel processor, he said. The Itanium will be capable, theoretically, of performing at six gigaflops, or performing six billion operations per second, Smith said. The chip will include 4 integer units and 2 floating point units, two internal structures integral to mathematical calculations. In addition, Itanium will come with up to 4MB of secondary cache memory, Intel said. Cache serves as a data reservoir for the processor and enhances performance. Current Intel Xeon chips top out at 2MB of cache. In its package, the chip is slightly smaller than a 3 x 5 index card. To complement the chip, Intel will also produce the 460GX chipset, which will work with standard 100-MHz memory, the company said. Initially, the Itanium will not be geared to work with next generation Rambus memory. Server builders typically are more concerned with the amount, rather than the speed, of memory, and using standard memory initially will allow them to pack much more memory into their systems. Intel is currently having trouble with its 820 chipset, which is the first to use Rambus memory. More "Coppermine" details Intel will also use the Microprocessor Forum to provide more details on its "Coppermine" Pentium III processor, which is expected on October 25. Coppermine differs from current Pentium IIIs in that it will contain 256KB of integrated secondary cache on the same silicon as the processor. Current Pentium IIIs come with 512KB of cache, but the cache is on separate chips. Although smaller, the integrated cache will boost performance and help Intel close the performance gap between the Pentium III family and AMD's recently released Athlon chips. Overall, Intel states that its own benchmarks show that Coppermine outperforms standard Pentium IIIs in 3D tests by 13 to 23 percent. The new Coppermines are expected to run at 700 MHz, with a 733-MHz version coming soon after. Mobile versions of the chip running at 500 MHz will also be released. Coppermine processors will also come with a 133-MHz system bus, which is the main conduit between the processor and the rest of the computer. Most Intel system buses today run at 100 MHz. Later, Coppermine chips will work with Rambus memory.;

2002-01-02 - Linux makes inroads into high-end computers

Article:
Parallel actions by Hewlett-Packard, SGI and Red Hat are combining to put major muscle into the development of Linux for Intel's future flagship Itanium chip. Gartner analyst George Weiss says Linux technology and the market itself are not mature enough for a significant run at the high end. see commentary   Next week, Hewlett-Packard and Intel are expected to release programming tools that will enable people to create and run software designed for the new chip, sources familiar with the companies' plans said. Though some of these tools exist already, the key new feature will be an HP product that lets people try out Itanium software without having to wait for one of the relatively rare prototype machines. Intel and HP representatives declined to comment on the plan. Meanwhile, SGI--a maker of high-end computers that is banking much of its future on Linux and Intel chips--released its own tools Monday to help write software for Itanium computers. Members of the Trillian team creating Linux for Itanium have been eagerly awaiting these critical tools, called "compilers," which translate programming code into instructions a computer chip can understand. While HP has the most experience with the details of the IA-64 architecture, SGI is good with compiler expertise in other areas. "They have had historically very good compilers, and they have very good compiler people," said MicroDesign Resources analyst Keith Diefendorff said. The release of the HP emulation software will be accompanied by compilers developed by Cygnus and supporting software called libraries from Intel. Red Hat has caught up to rival TurboLinux by releasing its test version of Linux for the Itanium chip. TurboLinux released its first version, a very raw prototype, two months ago. The moves are critical for Linux if it's going to meet the expectations Intel and others have for the upstart operating system, still too new to be suitable for most high-end applications. Consequently, Linux currently is most popular in low-end servers based on 32-bit Intel chips, but Itanium and its successors in Intel's "IA-64" family offer a path that could lead Linux into higher-end computers. But developing software for the new chip is difficult right now because there are so few Itanium prototype computers to go around. Intel has shipped more than 3,000 so far, but the systems are in high demand and aren't available to the vast majority of Linux programmers. The three announcements illustrate the cooperative nature of the Linux movement: All the companies involved, as well as others, can take advantage of the software its competitors are releasing. By comparison, Microsoft and Sun are working separately to develop Itanium versions of their own operating systems. Linux, a clone of Unix developed by a host of "open-source" programmers who share software, competes with Windows and versions of Unix from Sun and others. To accommodate the Linux movement, Intel has had to curtail its usually secretive methods, sharing more chip information than is typical for an unreleased product. The goal is that Itanium versions of Linux will be available at the same time Itanium systems ship later this year. Linux dovetails with Intel's philosophy of bringing high-end technology into mainstream computers. Intel hopes the Itanium chip and its successors will bring Intel technology into expensive, high-power computers that previously were the domain of Sun, Compaq, IBM and SGI, each of which have 64-bit processors. The Itanium chip, Intel's first 64-bit processor, will be able to manage vastly larger databases than 32-bit chips and will be much faster at mathematical calculations. HP, the original inventor of the design underlying the IA-64 chips, has its own compilers but has yet to release them. "In my talking to HP, my feeling is they believe their value-add in this whole IA-64 proposition is their compiler," Diefendorff said. More surprising to Diefendorff was the fact that SGI chose to release its compiler. Likely reasons for the move include an attempt to win the attention, respect and goodwill of the Linux community and to foster development of software that will run on the type of computers SGI is good at building, such as its next-generation SN-1. SGI released its compilers as open-source software under the General Public License license, which allows other programmers--including SGI competitors--to see how SGI achieved its reputation for strong compiler abilities. In addition, the SGI compilers may legally be fused with compilers from Red Hat's Cygnus team or modified by a user. Microsoft is attached to the IA-64 architecture for some of the same reasons as Linux companies are: a way to penetrate untapped high-end markets. Microsoft's new Windows 2000 operating system is helping to undo the company's reputation for crash-prone software, but at the same time, the number of chips Windows runs on has dropped from four in the 1990s to one today. Intel favors three operating systems for IA-64 computers: Linux, Windows and a version of Unix called Monterey-64 being jointly developed by IBM and Santa Cruz Operation. IBM has its own plans for using Linux in high-end machines. The company's work developing Linux for its mainframe S/390 computers has now become an actual product. TurboLinux and SuSE, two of the four major sellers of Linux, will distribute Linux for the S/390 in partnership with IBM's global services, IBM said today. The new version will allow Linux software to be used on these very expensive but very reliable servers, opening them to a wider range of uses. Sun, though its Solaris operating system is more mature than Linux, can only dream of the attention Intel is lavishing on Linux. Intel and Sun are feuding over how much support Intel will give Sun in developing Solaris for IA-64. At the root of the disagreement is the fact that Sun prefers to sell computers based on its own UltraSparc chips.;

2002-01-02 - Microsoft ready to send 64-bit Windows 2000 to developers

Article:
Microsoft has completed a near-final version of its 64-bit edition of Windows 2000 that will be sent to all software developers with Itanium prototype computers, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said today. The new "preview" version Gartner analyst Neil MacDonald says most businesses will greet the latest beta of Microsoft's 64-bit version of Windows 2000 with little interest. see commentary  of 64-bit Windows 2000 is a necessary step along the road to bringing a Windows operating system to computers based on Intel's next-generation Itanium chips. Intel and Microsoft see the new computers as a way to divert revenue--and fat profits--from Sun Microsystems and other manufacturers of high-end Unix servers. Although the preview release represents a milestone, the company's server strategy is far from seamless. The Datacenter version of Windows 2000, a beefed-up version of 32-bit Windows 2000 for servers, remains noticeably absent. This version, about a month late, was due four months after the Windows 2000 debut. Two final versions of 64-bit Windows, one for servers and one for workstations, will be released when computer manufacturers begin selling their systems, said Michael Stephenson, lead product manager for the Windows enterprise server division. The first Itanium processors, which will run at 800 MHz, are expected in the next few months. Computers incorporating the chip may appear toward the end of the year, according to several sources. Today's version is "about 95 percent feature-complete," Stephenson said. It's similar in technological maturity to a beta version, though Microsoft is avoiding the term "beta" to describe the software unfurled today. Even when production versions arrive, 64-bit Windows isn't expected to have an immediate effect, said Summit Strategies analyst Dwight Davis. "My gut sense is that it's going to be (for) pilot kinds of programs, and there won't be significant volumes through this year. "Ultimately, there will be more near-term demand for the 32-bit version of Datacenter than for the 64-bit Windows, which obviously will grow in sync with the 64-bit Intel platform," Davis said. Gates, speaking at the Windows Professional Developer Conference in Orlando, Fla., also said updated programming tools are available for those writing low-level and high-level software. And Microsoft is making 10 Itanium systems available to programmers who don't have the new computers but who need to test their codes remotely. The preview edition will be sent to those running the 5,000 Itanium prototypes Intel has sent, said Ron Curry, director of IA-64 marketing for Intel. Analysts and computer companies agree the biggest market that the 64-bit technology will open is the use of massive databases. That's because 32-bit systems can talk to relatively small amounts of memory--4 gigabytes--whereas 64-bit systems can keep vast amounts of information at hand. 64-bit vs. 32-bit chip? A 64-bit chip:Allows computers to incorporate vastly more memory than the 4-gigabyte limit imposed by 32-bit chips.Provides substantial performance improvement because information can be transferred in 64-bit, rather than 32-bit, parcels.Can run software such as complex databases that typically require huge amounts of memory and can manage higher-precision mathematical calculations. Customers who need to use large, fast databases today often purchase computers from Sun, IBM, Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard or SGI, all of which have a 64-bit version of Unix that runs on their own 64-bit chip. In the first three months of this year, $6.6 billion worth of these Unix servers were sold, according to market research firm International Data Corp. Intel is backing three operating systems for mainstream use on Itanium machines and the successors in the IA-64 family: Windows, Linux and a hybrid of three versions of Unix called Monterey-64, spearheaded by IBM and Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), among others. Boosting Linux on Itanium has been a novel experience for Intel because the Unix clone is produced by a loosely organized band of programmers. Intel has been helping by offering some programmers sneak peeks at the new architectures, a fact that will enable Linux for the first time to be ready when the new chips arrive, instead of trickling out months later. The earliest version of Linux for Itanium was released in February. TurboLinux, followed by Red Hat, released a complete prototype distribution of the heart of Linux along with other necessary components. VA Linux Systems has made test servers available for remote debugging. And last month, HP released software that allows people with today's 32-bit systems to test whether their 64-bit Itanium software works. The initial versions of 64-bit Windows were developed on Compaq's Alpha chips, but the effort has moved completely to Itanium chips, Stephenson said. Compaq abandoned plans for Windows on its 64-bit Alpha chips last year.;

2002-01-02 - Commentary AMD ''reasonably uncrushable'' vs Intel

Article:
This just in: Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD) has proclaimed itself "reasonably uncrushable" when it comes to battling its larger nemesis Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC). We'd take it a step farther and say AMD has graduated from being a chimp to a gorilla. Now there are two 800-pound gorillas in the chip market. Luckily for us, the gorilla warfare is entertaining. AMD checked in with its latest quarterly results Wednesday and threw in a stock split for good measure. The company reported second quarter net income of $207.1 million, or $1.21 per share. First Call's survey of 18 analysts predicted an AMD profit of $1.14 per share for the quarter ended July 2. Sales were up 7 percent sequentially to $1.17 billion. Exactly a year ago, AMD was losing tons of cash. The results, coupled with strong demand that only "an act of God" could derail, had AMD officials giddy. And why not? AMD has been running circles around Intel, which has had numerous problems and took a $200 million charge to replace defective motherboards in its second quarter. In the chip race, AMD is giving Intel a great run with strong products. In addition, AMD's quarter was refreshing because it was clean and easy to understand. Translation: No major investment gains to puff up results. Intel's quarter was messy to say the least. The company had a $2.1 billion investment gain in its second quarter. Back that gain out and Intel doesn't look so hot. In fact, operating earnings were flat. Of course, Intel gets a free pass on Wall Street. Of 33 analysts only three are cautious on the stock. No matter how many glitches, odd financial items or body blows Intel takes from AMD, analysts are usually cheery despite the challenges. "We believe that Intel will likely outperform in the second half," said Scott Randall, an analyst at Wit SoundView, who reiterated a "strong buy" rating Wednesday. But even the biggest cheerleaders have a few concerns. Ashok Kumar, of USB Piper Jaffray, said Intel "left some money on the table" by underestimating demand in recent quarters. Meanwhile, AMD keeps making a lot of noise. On a conference call with analysts, Hector J. Ruiz, president and chief operating officer for AMD, struggled to be negative. "I have to think hard to say something negative," he said. The processor market also looks robust, executives said. Shipments of 1GHz Athlon chips quintupled during the quarter, said Ruiz. "We were able to meet our commitments to all our customers in this high-end segment," Ruiz said, contrasting Athlon's availability with the shortage of Intel's 1GHz Pentium III chips. As for the flash memory market, there's no slowdown in sight. AMD said it is already sold out through the year. Some analysts have said flash memory, which powers wireless devices, was headed for a slowdown. On its core Athlon and Duron processors, AMD was also bullish. The company said shipments will increase to 3.6 million units in the third quarter and to 7.2 million units in the fourth quarter. The growth should provide higher average selling prices. The chip market is fragile and has a history of boom and bust cycles, but for now AMD is booming. Big Blue sees blue skies in second halfAfter three quarters devoid of revenue growth, investors were hoping for any kind of optimism coming from IBM's (NYSE: IBM) second quarter conference call. Big Blue delivered. As far as the second quarter results go, IBM had a ho-hum quarter. The company topped estimates with earnings of $1.06 a share, but sales fell 1 percent year-over-year to $21.7 billion. The outlook, however, was the real focus. The company remains comfortable with analysts' full year earnings estimates, CFO John Joyce said, during a conference call with analysts. First Call currently predicts a profit of $4.36 per share for 2000. Joyce also said he "felt good about our momentum." Joyce said mainframe shipments were perking up (1 percent growth in the second quarter after previous declines), and added the second half looked strong. Joyce even went out on a limb and said the company could hit double-digit revenue growth in the second half. Analysts estimate that IBM will post mid-single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth in the second half. IBM even said its PC division may post a profit by the end of the year. Now that's optimistic.

2002-01-02 - Intel to spend 100 million on assistance program

Article:
NEW YORK--In the next year, Intel will spend more than $100 million on a new program to lend its business partners a helping hand gaining entry to markets Intel hopes to penetrate. The program, announced at the PC Expo show here today, will focus on helping Intel customers such as Dell Computer or Compaq Computer tune their Intel-based servers so they can win a place against competing server designs, said Will Swope, general manager of the newly formed Intel solutions enabling group that's in charge of the program. Though Intel will charge those partners $50,000 apiece for the privilege of receiving Intel's expertise, Swope says the program's purpose isn't to garner Intel more revenue, but rather to further the adoption of Intel hardware in the long run. The fee merely covers the costs of the program, he said, which will involve thousands of Intel employees. The program is part of Intel's increasingly aggressive push to steal away market share from higher-powered servers, typically running variants of Unix atop RISC chips Intel hopes to supplant. Intel's years-long strategy is to extend its dominance on desktop computers into ever more expensive, complex, powerful and profitable machines. The strategy marks a more active engagement between Intel and the computer makers that buy its chips. Intel hopes essentially to tow its customers into new markets, helping them by designing Intel hardware that can get the job done. The program is beginning with servers, but will expand to other Intel products later, Intel said. Intel is in a sense taking a page from the Unix-RISC marketing manual, where tight integration between chipmaker and computer manufacturer often is inevitable. In the case of IBM, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, SGI and especially Sun Microsystems, a single company designs the chip, the computer and the fundamental software known as the operating system. Intel's Itanium chip, due later this year and the first 64-bit CPU in Intel's "IA-64" family, is the spearhead of Intel's push to dethrone the more powerful Unix-RISC servers. Intel also has high hopes for future computers with eight more Intel CPUs. "As we roll out IA-64 and new and improved eight-way servers, we know we have applications that will work stunningly better," Swope said. In addition, Intel today announced an expansion of its existing program to let customers visit centers where they can translate their software to Intel hardware. The centers also help value-added resellers (VARs)--companies that typically sell hardware with their own specialized software to a particular market, Swope said. VARs often have a difficult time, for example, testing their software designed for a network with 50 PCs to work on a network with 200, he said. "We're making sure that applications can be tuned and delivered on Intel servers," Swope said.;

2002-01-02 - IBM ups Linux support with laptops

Article:
IBM today jumped behind Linux in a big way. Big Blue is increasing its commitment to the Unix variant in high-end systems, laptops and desktop PCs. Among the changes: the availability of SuSE Linux on select RS/6000 servers and Caldera OpenLinux on A20 and T20 ThinkPads; WebSphere support for Linux; the introduction of a software bundle for small businesses relying on Linux; and funding for Linux education and certification. Today's announcement ups the ante for big-iron server companies backing Linux, with IBM substantially widening its support in both Linux servers and services. The move also pits IBM against Compaq Computer, which has an early market lead selling the Unix variant. Gartner analyst George Weiss said IBM's Gartner analyst George Weiss says IBM's Linux push will help increase the credibility of Linux in the enterprise sector. see commentary  increased emphasis on Linux is obviously good for the company and could bring more corporate attention to the Unix variant. But Weiss warned that Linux has yet to prove itself "in large enterprise deployments" and added that fledging "software developer enthusiasm, service and support on a global basis, disaster recovery, and other service-level guarantees" are significant weaknesses that must be overcome before the operating system makes additional headway in corporate installations. Initially, SuSE Linux will be available on just a few RS/6000 models, with wider support planned for later in the year. The B50 rack-mountable server, which IBM targets at service providers; F-50 deckside server; and 43P model 150 entry servers and workstations are among the first RS/6000s supporting Linux. IBM said it would later offer Linux on its AS/400 systems but would not give specific information on availability. Big Blue already offers Linux on Netfinity servers and has been testing it on the S/390. "You will absolutely see Linux available on our entire server line," said Buell Duncan, general manager of IBM's global business partners group. The stumbling block is "the ability for the applications to port and migrate across our server family." Besides the server news, IBM announced that WebSphere version 3.02 now supports Linux applications. WebSphere, IBM?s main business-to-business e-commerce software package, could benefit from supporting Linux applications, many of which are geared toward the Internet and are available free. Big Blue also introduced Small Business Pack for Linux, with DB2 Universal Database 7.1, WebSphere 3.02 and Lotus Domino Application Server 5.03, for a promotional price of $499. According to International Data Corp., 48 percent of Linux installations go into small businesses with 100 employees or less. To bolster Linux services and support, Big Blue today committed several million dollars to support and training programs for 45,000 software developers and 45,000 IBM dealers. Duncan said that in the past year, IBM has invested $10 million in e-business training. Unlike competing commercial operating systems, such as Microsoft?s Windows 2000 or Solaris from Sun Microsystems, Linux is an open-source effort, with many programmers continually contributing to its development. Programmer Linus Torvalds first developed the Unix derivative in 1991. In the past few years, several software companies, such as Red Hat and VA Linux, have hit it big offering commercial versions of Linux and associated services. But not all is well in the Linux community. Canadian software maker Corel, which has all but bet the company?s future on Linux, last week laid off 320 employees as part of restructuring. Corel seeks to trim $40 million in annual spending. Linux?s biggest success has been on servers, where Compaq commands the lion's share of the market. In the fourth quarter, the Houston-based PC maker had 25 percent Linux server market share, compared with 10 percent for IBM and 7 percent each for Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer, according to IDC. IBM's bolstering of not just server but software and services support for Linux could be the boost it needs to widen its lead over Dell and HP and close the gap with Compaq. The Linux battle rages on other fronts. While Microsoft fights with the government over the future of Windows, some of its biggest competitors are positioning Linux for the future, with HP, Red Hat, SGI and Sun working on projects to bring Linux to Intel?s Itanium processor. By contrast, Microsoft?s efforts to quickly bring a 64-bit version of Windows 2000 to market may lag behind Linux. Linux is slowly gaining ground on the desktop, with Dell and others offering the operating system on some commercial PCs. But Linux availability on portables has lagged, mainly because of driver deficiencies and other compatibility problems. Big Blue last year broke ground on certifying Linux for portables--Red Hat 6.0 on the ThinkPad 600E--but fell short of offering it preinstalled. Today?s commitment goes much further, with Linux available directly from IBM and on its newest ThinkPad models. IBM is not the only major computer manufacturer offering Linux on portables. Dell in February started offering Red Hat Linux 6.1 preinstalled on Latitude CPx and Inspiron 7500 notebooks. IBM today committed to preloading Caldera OpenLinux eDesktop 2.4 on the ThinkPad A20m and T20 models. In the third quarter, IBM promised to certify select ThinkPad models for Red Hat, SuSE and TurboLinux versions of Linux.;

2002-01-02 - Intel CEO says Sun model doomed

Article:
SAN JOSE, Calif.--The Berlin Wall came down long ago, but the specter of communism still looms as long as Sun Microsystems is around, Intel CEO Craig Barrett joked during an interview at Intel?s Developer Forum. Sun, which designs the hardware, software and processors that go into its servers, represents an increasingly outmoded way of doing business because it locks corporate customers into products or services from a single seller, Barrett said. By contrast, the "horizontal" PC market, where different companies sell interchangeable products based on common standards, lets customers shop around and will emerge victorious. "The horizontal makes much more progress than the vertical market. You just have to look at Sun," Barrett said with a laugh. "If (Sun CEO) Scott McNealy's model worked, communism would still be prevalent and challenging capitalism." Hyperbole aside, Sun represents the future challenge for Intel. Although Intel?s largest direct competitor remains Advanced Micro Devices, Sun will likely emerge as a prominent, visible antagonist in coming years. Sun leads the market for expensive, highly profitable servers for running e-commerce sites and business-to-business transaction services. That's a market that Intel wants to enter with its Itanium processor. Compaq Computer, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, among others, also want to put a dent in the 40 percent-plus growth Sun has seen in recent quarters. Sun?s McNealy and many of the PC companies have traded verbal barbs for years. Sun and Intel, however, had a nasty split six months ago over a now-defunct plan to bring Sun?s Solaris operating system to Intel?s Itanium chip. Intel claimed Sun was not dedicating the necessary resources to the project, while Sun said Intel overreacted. "Sun is going to get a lot of competition in their area of strength, which is the back office," Barrett said. "It wasn't the horizontal marketplace that brought eBay to its knees. The horizontal marketplace can provide just as good reliability as Sun." One of the advantages of the horizontal market is that, combined, a horizontal industry spends more research dollars than a single company. Historically, consumers also have gravitated away from vertical markets. "If the vertical market was successful, Apple would have 95 percent of the market rather than 4 percent," Barrett quipped. Barrett, who had just returned from fighting fires at his ranch in Montana, also said Intel has worked to shore up some loose ends at the company. On the acquisition side, Intel has begun to take a less heavy-handed approach toward changing cultures and processes at these companies. Rather than indoctrinate these new acquisitions right away, Intel has allowed the integration process to become more open-ended. "We've gotten quite better at it. We no longer smother our acquisitions," Barrett said. "You acquire people for the technology they have, the knowledge they have, and (you) keep all of it...If an acquired company has a different sales model or a different HR structure, there is not reason to slap them around...We are much more adaptable." As part of the integration process, the company appoints a proxy general manager from inside of Intel to teach new acquisitions the formal and informal rules of life at the company. Intel has also moved to correct manufacturing and planning problems, which helped cause a processor shortage that has lingered for nearly 10 months. The company simply didn?t anticipate demand correctly last year, Barrett said. Some products also had to be delayed because of defects. "I don't believe (Intel had) bad luck in that stuff...We kind of dropped the ball," he said. "We have been embarrassed by the slips and are dedicated not to have a continuing episode of these slips.";

The author argues that Sun's model, where they control both hardware and software, is outdated and will be surpassed by the more flexible and competitive horizontal model. This comparison is used to frame the impending challenge for Intel as they attempt to enter the server market dominated by Sun with their Itanium processor.

The article highlights the following points:

**Strengths of the horizontal market:**

* **Innovation:** The article claims the horizontal model drives more research and development due to the competition between different companies, unlike the vertical model where a single company controls everything.
* **Customer Choice:** The article emphasizes how the horizontal market offers customers greater flexibility to choose between different products and vendors, leading to more competitive pricing and better value.
* **Reliability:** Despite Sun's claims of superior reliability, the article asserts that the horizontal market can achieve similar levels of reliability due to the shared expertise and development across multiple companies.

**Challenges for Itanium:**

* **Competition:** The article emphasizes the intense competition from existing players like Sun, Compaq, IBM, and HP, all vying for market share in the server market.
* **Past Failure:** The article mentions a failed collaboration between Intel and Sun on bringing Sun's Solaris operating system to the Itanium chip. This failure implies a lack of trust and potential compatibility issues.
* **Uncertainty:** While the article highlights the potential for Itanium to succeed, it also acknowledges the challenges and uncertainties involved in competing against a well-established player like Sun.

## Sentiment Analysis:

The article's overall sentiment towards Itanium is **mixed**. While it acknowledges the potential of Itanium to disrupt the server market and gain market share, it also highlights the challenges and risks involved.

2002-01-02 - Intel thumbs its nose at economy's downturn

Article:
Barrett: Intel prepared for economic upturnCraig Barrett, CEO, Intel SAN JOSE, Calif.--Although high-tech demand is slow, Intel will continue to invest heavily in development and new products, CEO Craig Barrett vowed Tuesday. "You never save your way out of a recession," Barrett told the audience at the Intel Developer Forum here. "The slowdowns are going to end, and you need to prepare for the upswing...the build-out of the Internet, the build-out of this digital world is still in its infancy." To that end, the company will plow about $12 billion into capital expansion and research and development in 2001, Barrett said. The list includes preparing the "McKinley" processor for servers, retrofitting factories for churning out chips made with copper wires, and developing a fairly extensive line of chips for notebooks and handheld devices. If there was a theme to Barrett's speech, it was back to the future. A year ago, the company touted how it planned to move into a wider variety of markets such as the server appliance and Web-hosting markets. Many of these efforts have floundered. And like other tech companies, Intel has announced cutbacks. So now, the message is silicon, silicon, silicon. Barrett and Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel Architecture Group, also outlined a number of products and initiatives coming in 2001 and early 2002. These include: The processor that is code-named "McKinley." The successor to the long-delayed Itanium chip, McKinley will begin pilot production at the end of the year. The chip will have a much larger integrated cache for better performance than the Itanium and three times the bandwidth, or data throughput power. The chip will provide eight times the performance of an equivalent UltraSparc chip from Sun Microsystems on some benchmarks, Otellini said. Barrett demonstrated the chip, which came out in samples only three weeks ago. "That's great progress for them to make after three weeks of silicon," said Linley Gwennap, principal analyst at the Linley Group. Strong emphasis on the "extended PC." Intel and Microsoft will aggressively market the idea of the PC as the nerve center of the home entertainment network. Pentium 4 computers and Windows XP, Microsoft's upcoming operating system, are ideally suited for manipulating or delivering video, audio, photographs and other media, the companies assert. Mobile Pentium III chips. A 700MHz Pentium III came out Tuesday morning. Later in the quarter, the 1GHz mobile Pentium III will be released. In the second half, Intel will begin to make notebook chips on the 0.13-micron manufacturing process. These chips will use copper wires, rather than aluminum ones. Consumers will also see better integration of Bluetooth and 802.11b wireless technologies in notebooks. Mobile Pentium 4 chips. Otellini said the company's latest desktop chip will hit portables in 2002, with sources putting the release date in the second quarter. In 2003, the company will come out with a brand-new mobile chip architecture designed for power-efficiency and wireless connectivity. Apple Computer has a similar effort afoot that, Barrett pointed out, followed Intel's kickoff at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. "Perhaps this is one of the few times that (Apple CEO) Steve Jobs followed us in the marketplace." Networking and communications will expand. "We're going to produce at least 35 new IXA (Intel Exchange Architecture) products this year," Barrett said. These chips go into telecommunications equipment and networking gear. Itanium server chips. The long-delayed server chip and the precursor to McKinley will come out in the second quarter. "The sheer complexity of the task--the number of variables--was really more work than any of us in the company imagined," Otellini said, explaining why the chip was delayed so many times. "We had to debug it. We have to develop a new chipset. We were working with four (operating systems), one of which was a stable platform." New technologies for interconnecting servers. Intel is preparing a competitor to Lightning Data Transport from Advanced Micro Devices, Otellini said. It will be unveiled Thursday. Intel's expansive product plans are based on a massive investment in infrastructure, Barrett said. The company is investing in machinery to make copper chips on the 0.13-micron process. In addition, Intel is investing to manufacture chips from 300-millimeter wafers, rather than 200-millimeter ones. Through the magic of geometry, the larger diameter increases the number of chips that can be produced per wafer by 225 percent. That will result in a 35 percent reduction in costs. "I think the investment will pay for itself in lower costs," Barrett said. "It is new technology and products that let you walk out of a recession." Barrett, though, added that the economic picture could change. "There is absolutely a slowdown in U.S. manufacturing. It hasn't spread to other markets yet," he said. If the malaise does move overseas, a wider recession could hit. "There's a potentially bigger problem that hasn't hit yet," he said. However, the international markets haven't synchronized downward in a long time. "That hasn't happened in nearly 30 years.";

Title:
2002-01-02 - New technologies set stage for Intel server growth

Article:
The convergence of several new technologies is setting the stage for a time when Intel servers will be seen as more than just overgrown desktop computers. Intel will release two major server-specific chips in the coming months--the 64-bit Itanium processor this year and the 32-bit Foster early next year--as well as several motherboards, chipsets and nearly complete servers that some companies will use as foundations for their own products. But these servers will benefit from more than chip upgrades. Invisible, yet critical, supporting technology such as the InfiniBand data transfer standard and server-specific chipsets from ServerWorks will also be part of these new systems. Major computer manufacturers such as IBM, Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard and Unisys also are taking the initiative to design high-end systems that will cram 16 or more processors into a server. The goal is to develop computers that will enable these companies to capture some of the status and profits currently reserved for makers of proprietary Unix servers. The Internet-driven server sales boom has proven extremely lucrative for Unix server leader Sun Microsystems. To date, Intel largely has been largely locked out of this market, as has Microsoft, which earlier today released a "preview" copy of a 64-bit version of Windows for Itanium. IBM, HP, Compaq and others that will promote InfiniBand and Itanium in servers are already competing in the upper reaches of the Unix market. But by cooperating on technological standards, these companies can undercut the leader because they are effectively pooling research. To a certain degree, the market, as far as design is concerned, will be two-pronged. Servers containing eight or more processors will largely depend on technology provided by computer manufacturers. Many of the servers containing four or fewer processors, however, will be based around designs, and often subsystems, from Intel. "We're growing away from being the chipheads we were," said Mike Fister, vice president of the enterprise server group at Intel. "We build and sell (servers) at multiple levels of integration. To some we sell 'white box' systems," the generic computers that lack only a brand label. Added Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood: "Nobody is expecting the volumes on the initial Itanium machines to be enormous." But "everybody wants to have a box. The path of least resistance is to go with Intel." Compaq, though, is bucking the trend with its four-processor Itanium machine, which features its own motherboard and chipset, said Paul Santeler, vice president of enterprise Intel servers for Compaq. "IA-64 is going to be something that's around for a long time. You either pay development costs now or later," he said. Reaching this point, though, hasn't been easy. A rocky past For one, Intel and those who would use its chips have wrestled for control over the server designs. And Intel product delays left the chip giant languishing when Sun's dominance injected new energy into Unix server lines. Even the standard-bearer of the new era, the IA-64 chip family from Intel, will face a lukewarm debut tempered by the modest pace of adoption. And Compaq's Santeler predicts that the support for IA-64 won't reach full steam until the second-generation McKinley chip arrives. Advantages will grow with time, however. The Itanium chip and, more important, McKinley and other successors in the IA-64 family will give Intel servers the ability to use massive databases available today only on Unix servers, mainframes and other proprietary designs. Compaq's first Itanium system will hold as much as 64 gigabytes of memory--far more than the 4GB practical with current Intel chips, Santeler said. In addition, the chip family has features that will allow it to be used in multiprocessor systems with numerous CPUs and that make the computer less likely to crash, said Ron Curry, director of IA-64 marketing. Chipsets in play Chipsets, which join the CPU, memory and other central components, are finally receiving the attention once reserved for CPUs. A company called ServerWorks is building chipsets specifically designed for servers. ServerWorks has licensed high-end server technology from IBM in a five-year agreement. The deal will make possible mainstream systems that are more reliable and that aren't afflicted with today's comparatively slow internal data transfer speeds of today's Intel servers, said ServerWorks chief executive Raju Vegesna. ServerWorks has a technology agreement that ensures its products will be able to communicate with Intel chips through 2008. Its server specialization allowed it to win a presence in every one of the biggest server makers' products. ServerWorks' chipsets will be for mainstream computers, but several higher-end chipsets also are on the way. IBM is working on a Summit chipset that will allow for 16-processor IA-64 machines, said Tom Bradicich, director of the architecture of IBM's Intel servers. HP also has its own chipset that will enable 16-CPU IA-64 servers, said Duane Zitzner, president of HP's computer division. Unisys already has a server, its ES7000, that will support 32 IA-64 chips, and Compaq is selling it under its own name. NEC and Hitachi also have designs in the pipeline that will support systems with 16 or more IA-64 CPUs, Intel's Walker added. Compaq is building a chipset called the F8 that will enable 8-CPU Foster servers. "We're really excited about Foster," Santeler said. The chip comes with 10 parallel memory controllers to ensure that the CPUs can communicate with memory fast enough, he said. InfiniBand will arrive in 2001 as a way to speed connections to networks and storage systems and as a way to join computers in high-performance cooperatives. IBM has announced it's making InfiniBand chips. Though the technology will arrive in time for the McKinley chip in the second half of 2001, "there are people targeting earlier processors," said Jim Bowers, architecture marketing manager at IBM. InfiniBand's obvious use is to plug devices such as network cards and hard disk controllers into a computer. But the more powerful use in all likelihood will be joining processors into clusters that can work cooperatively or take over from each other when one fails, analysts say. Bowers said InfiniBand will be used across a vast spectrum of Intel servers, costing anywhere from $2,000 to $250,000, though it first will show up in midrange systems.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Stratus debuts delayed Windows server

Article:
High-end-server maker Stratus Technologies will take a step into the low-end market Monday when it introduces its first machine using Intel chips and Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating system. Stratus sells high-end, crash-resistant machines for jobs such as running 911 emergency call systems or ATM networks, where the operators can't afford to have a machine go down. To ensure that its servers are reliable, the company uses carefully tested software and backup hardware components--"redundant" components--that keep running if the primary unit fails. Until now, the 1,100-employee, Maynard, Mass.-based company has used Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC chips in systems that ran either the HP-UX version of Unix or Stratus' VOS operating system. These systems typically cost $200,000 to $300,000, said Chief Executive Steve Kiely. The new Intel and Windows-based ftServer 5200, though, will start at $28,000, with typical models costing in the mid-$30,000 range, Kiely said. This price difference will let the company tackle customers looking for affordable systems to handle less-critical jobs such as e-mail. The cheaper price tag means the company expects to earn more revenue from the Windows machines than from its other lines in the fiscal year ending Feb. 28, 2002, Kiely said. The profits will change over the year after that, he said. But the system is late: The company said last year that the ftServer would arrive in September 2000. "It wasn't ready," Kiely said. "It was more important to have it absolutely perfect than it was to ring the bell on time to market." Stratus, long a niche player, will face heavy competition as it tries to move into the Intel server domain dominated by giants such as Dell Computer and Compaq Computer. Sun Microsystems could provide a challenge, too, as it cuts prices on its own Unix servers. Stratus' plan, though, is to sign "original equipment manufacturing" partnerships so these potential rivals will sell the Stratus systems under their own brands, Kiely said. The company has trumpeted one such deal, with NEC in Japan, and it has others up its sleeve, Kiely said. "We have OEM partners signed on in Japan. In the U.S., we have a couple signed up but not announced," he said. It can be tough for niche players, though. Network Engines, which pioneered superthin two-processor servers, is beseiged now that major server makers have their own designs. And Unisys has been struggling to spread its high-end CMP server design. The ftServer 5200 is a four-processor machine, though double- and triple-redundant components mean it's actually built with eight or 12 CPUs. The system uses Intel's latest server chip, the "Foster" Xeon model based on the Pentium 4 design. More ftServer models are on the way. The lower-end ftServer 3200, co-developed by NEC, is expected in July. That system is a two-processor setup, with only double redundancy available. And in late 2002 or early 2003, the company will release a model using the second-generation version of Intel's top-end Itanium CPU, Kiely said. The company also will use Windows 2002--the server successor to Windows 2000--on which Stratus has been working in conjunction with Microsoft. "We want to make the operating system as indifferent as possible to changes in hardware state," Kiely said. That would include changes that make it easier to swap out hardware components without shutting down the machine, he said. Stratus, though privately owned, is profitable, Kiely said. Though the spending downturn has hurt the company and spurred expense cuts, no layoffs were required, he said. "We're hoping (the market) will recover in the second half. We're optimistic, but not betting on it," Kiely said. "We had enough of a cushion in operating margin that we're...not reducing staff.";

2002-01-02 - SGI promotes CFO boosts Linux effort

Article:
SGI, struggling to regain its share of the graphics workstation business, has promoted Chief Financial Officer Hal Covert to president, freeing Chief Executive Bob Bishop to spend more time with customers. In addition, the Mountain View, Calif., company released version 1.0 of a high-end file system for Linux, the clone of Unix that SGI has banked on heavily for its future workstation and server products. SGI promised that the software would be released for Linux nearly two years ago. "I can focus on the internal operations," concentrating on making the company more efficient and profitable, Covert said in an interview Tuesday. That means Bishop "will be able to focus full-time attention on customers and the overall strategic direction of the company." Covert will retain his CFO title but shift some of his duties to others. Years ago, SGI hoped to use Intel servers with the Windows operating system to help the company become as powerful as Sun Microsystems, but the plan proved overambitious, and SGI reverted to its older plan of selling high-end Unix supercomputers and systems for tasks such as scrutinizing automobile designs. The worsening economic climate has made the transition harder, and SGI announced in April it would lay off 1,000 employees to adjust for lower revenue. The company hopes to achieve profitability in the quarter beginning in July. "We're a little behind where we want to be," Covert said. Others were more skeptical. "We believe SGI is three to four quarters away from operating profitability," Salomon Smith Barney analyst John Jones wrote in a recent research note. "SGI's announced 1,000-employee staff reduction is a good start, although this special charge will likely cost" $65 million to $75 million in cash in the third and fourth quarters of calendar 2001. The current economic climate has been hammering SGI as well as competitors such as Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard and Sun, but Covert said the company expects the situation to improve in the second half of 2001. Covert joined SGI after leaving Linux software company Red Hat in July 2000. SGI is banking on Linux for computers using Intel's upcoming Itanium chip, expected to be announced late this May, according to a source familiar with the plan. Part of the company's longer-term effort to accommodate the chip consequently relies on improving Linux in directions where SGI thinks it can do better than the competition. To that end, SGI released version 1.0 of XFS, file system software that governs how a computer reads and writes information on hard disks. XFS is a "journaling" file system, which keeps track of changes to files so that it's easier and faster to recover from computer crashes. Most high-end operating systems, such as Windows 2000 and various versions of Unix, have journaling file systems. With the release of XFS, Linux now has four, along with JFS from IBM, ReiserFS and ext3. Because Linux computers can use numerous file systems simultaneously and the various journaling file systems each have their advantages, top Linux programmers intend to let all the file systems compete side by side.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Intel's competitors refuse to follow the leader

Article:
SAN JOSE, California--Intel is forging ahead with high-end processor plans, although the chip giant is moving in a direction that no one else seems interested in following. While Intel's upcoming Itanium chip, code-named Merced, speaks a brand-new language, IBM, Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, AMD, and other competitors are sticking with the chip architectures they already have. Those Intel competitors laid down the gauntlet yesterday, unveiling high-end chip plans at the Microprocessor Forum here and revealing a wide variety of ways to extend their current chip designs. Intel says those current chip designs are hobbled and don't have room to grow. But Intel's competitors, in sticking with existing designs, offer a huge benefit: They don't require software firms to overhaul their products. (When computer makers adopt a new chip architecture, all software must be reworked to fit the new design.) "We see no need to move to a new architecture," IBM's Jim Kahle said in a talk to hundreds of chip designers at the annual processor industry conference. "Our customers demand architecture stability." Intel acknowledges that many improvements emerged at this week's conference but said its own chips will be able to benefit from many of those design improvements in coming years. With Itanium, Intel is focusing on creating a "better building block" that later can be updated with technologies such as multiple CPUs within a single chip, said Harsh Sharangpani, principal engineer of the Itanium chip. Ironically, the debate resembles one that began years ago when the roles were reversed. Then, Intel stuck with existing "CISC" designs while competitors shifted to new "RISC" designs. To address performance problems, different companies are taking different approaches for chips that are scheduled to arrive in 2001 or later. IBM, with its Power4, is putting two central processing units (CPUs) on a single chip and connecting lots of Power4 chips with super-high-speed data pathways. Compaq's Alpha EV8 chip will use a method called "symmetrical multithreading" that doubles performance with only a minor increase in the size of the chip. And HAL Computer Systems, which makes chips for Fujitsu based on Sun's Sparc designs, said some of the methods Intel is pursuing with its IA-64 chips don't provide much performance benefit. All chips speak a language called an "instruction set," and for years Intel's chips instruction set has been known as "x86." However, with its upcoming Itanium chip--the first in a the family that uses the IA-64 instruction set--Intel is beginning a new era. AMD, meanwhile, still sees a future in the x86 architecture. It's extending the x86 line with its own 64-bit chips, said AMD's Fred Weber, vice president of engineering for AMD's Computation Products Group. HAL's Sparc64 V Mike Shebanow, a designer of HAL's Sparc64 V chip due in 2001, said his company found that a method called "predication" sped up chip operations only about 5 percent. Predication is the process of writing software more efficiently before it's ever processed by the chip, avoiding situations where one calculation in the chip must await the outcome of another before it can be completed. Shebanow, though, said his company has found it's more worthwhile for the chip to spend time on "super-speculation," executing instructions in advance, anticipating that one particular calculation is the right course of action and discarding the results if it's not. Intel's Sharangpani, though, believes that HAL didn't have a complete use of the predication method. "You can't patch these things on and expect the benefit," he said. Compaq's EV8 Compaq's EV8 is due in 2002 and will run at speeds of 1.2 GHz to 2 GHz, said Joel Emer, principle member of Compaq's Alpha design staff. It will be manufactured with on a process capable of making features as small as 0.125 microns and will use two methods--copper interconnects and silicon-on-insultor technology--that increase a chip's speed and decrease its power consumption. The symmetrical multithreading technique adds only 5 percent to the area of the chip, Emer said, while doubling its performance. The method essentially provides a more efficient way to feed a CPU instructions and data, filling up spare moments during which CPU is otherwise idling, Emer said. Emer said symmetrical multithreading of using a CPU more efficiently is less costly than IBM's brute-force method of stuffing multiple CPUs in a single chip. Indeed, Microdesign Resources analyst Keith Diefendorff said IBM's technique does use more silicon. But the symmetrical multithreading method is "more of a research thing"--in other words, a less proven idea. IBM's Power4 IBM thinks its Power4 design is plenty good, too. Big Blue's Power4 will debut in 2001, will run at speeds of at least 1 GHz, will have 170 million transistors, and will use both silicon-on-insulator and copper interconnect technology, Kahle said. The Power4 is a huge chip, with two CPUs connected to a large amount of high-speed memory called cache. Altogether, the package plugs into computers with 5,500 pins to transfer data--roughly 10 times as many as the Itanium. The Power4 has very high internal data transfer speeds, Kahle said. It can move data from the cache to the CPU at speeds of 100 gigabytes per second--fast enough to transfer 20 feature movies in a single second, Kahle said;

2002-01-02 - Intel shelves 800-MHz Xeon chip

Article:
Intel has canceled plans for high-end versions of its 800-MHz Xeon processor, saying computer makers didn't want the chip. The Xeon is Intel's high-end version of its Pentium III. The most expensive Xeons come with 1MB or 2MB of high-speed cache memory built into the chip itself. Intel released 700-MHz versions of these large-cache Xeons in May but decided to skip the 800-MHz version, company spokesman Otto Pijpker said today. Intel customers such as Compaq Computer "asked us to reduce the pace of large-cache processor introductions," Pijpker said. The move had nothing to do with Intel's ability to make the chips, he said. Compaq spokesman Steve Thieme concurred. "Our customers are looking for less frequent updates with larger incremental gains," he said. "We certainly relay our customer requirements to Intel." Indeed, computer makers have a lot of work to do to keep up with Intel's upcoming high-end chip launches for server computers, said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. The Itanium chip, the first in a new family of higher-powered 64-bit chips from Intel, will launch in the next few months at speeds of 800 MHz, with Level 3 cache of 2MB and 4MB, Pijpker said. Foster, a new update to the existing 32-bit chip line and successor to Xeon, will debut in the first quarter of 2001 at speeds greater than 1 GHz, Pijpker added. But even without those new lines, just keeping up with the existing Cascades line of current Pentium III and Xeon chips is difficult, Brookwood said. "Every time Intel comes out with a new speed bump in the current Cascades line, these guys have to stop and qualify not only uniprocessor models, but dual-processor, four-way, eight-way...None of those qualifications is easy work." In an effort to adjust to the different demands of higher-end marketplaces, Intel has been trying to ease back on how fast new chips come out. "For a while we tried really hard to keep up with the desktop space. But the customer feedback was that, in general, they weren't going to introduce servers at the same rate they introduce new PCs," Pijpker said.;

2002-01-02 - Intel makes strides with Tualatin chips

Article:
NEW YORK--Intel has moved forward in two major areas of the chipmaking process with "Tualatin," the new Pentium III processor the company showed off at the PC Expo trade show Wednesday. Tualatin, also known as Pentium III-M, will initially be used mainly in notebooks. Intel executives said all of the major notebook makers, including Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard, Dell Computer, Fujitsu and Sony, will adopt the new chip. Several have shown Tualatin-powered notebooks at PC Expo, part of the Technology Exchange Week New York event. Tualatin uses Intel's new 0.13-micron manufacturing process, which allows smaller circuits to be printed on the chip, thus increasing the processing power that can be squeezed onto a piece of silicon. Tualatin also marks Intel's entry into the chip industry's copper shift, using the metal to connect circuits on the chip. It's unusual for a chipmaker to make two major shifts with the same product, but Intel felt the time was right for both, Frank Spindler, vice president and general manager of Intel's Mobile Computing Group, said in a PC Expo interview with CNET News.com. The 0.13-micron manufacturing process essentially shrinks the size of processor features from the current 0.18-micron process. That means faster chips that consume less power. "We think everything about the 0.13-micron technology is significant," Spindler said. The move to copper interconnects--the metal wires that connect transistors--also promises faster clock speeds. Intel is the last large chipmaker to switch to copper, after Advanced Micro Devices, IBM and Motorola. Spindler said that Intel, which takes an incremental approach to adding new technologies to its chips, didn't feel it needed copper right away. "We have found that other companies will highlight a particular technology like copper because it helps them overcome architectural issues with their designs," Spindler said. "We're not trying to overcome a core weakness. "We waited until it provided a substantial benefit. It's going to help us get to higher frequencies, and it will help on the power" consumption. The incremental approach to new technologies boils down to "a lot of stuff over a long period of time," Spindler said, as opposed to creating a brand-new chip from the ground up. Gartner analyst Martin Reynolds says Intel's current challenge is moving the Pentium 4 into the IT mainstream. see commentary "It underscores the point that delivering performance and lower power is more than one magic thing," he said. Tualatin's speed and power advantages will initially be concentrated in laptops. Compaq announced a Tualatin-powered notebook at PC Expo that weighs 2.5 pounds and runs for eight hours on a battery charge. Notebooks, which continue to outdistance desktop PCs in sales growth, have become increasingly important to Intel as the PC market stalls. Tualatin will become Intel's new bread-and-butter processor for mobile. Despite the planned introduction of a mobile Pentium 4 next year, Tualatin will live through 2003 before Intel replaces it, company executives said. The first Tualatin chips are expected to range in clock speed from 866MHz to 1.13GHz when they debut late next month. Later, Intel will introduce low- and ultra-low-voltage versions of the chip. Compaq executives also said the company would adopt Pentium III-M in its Presario 1700 series later in the year. Workstation and server versions of Tualatin will be available later, but desktop PCs based on the chip are unlikely. Intel executives said the company is encouraging PC makers to use the chips only for consumer-oriented desktops, while relying on the Pentium 4 for corporate machines. Compaq, for one, says it's happy with its current mix of Pentium III, Pentium 4 and AMD Athlon processors. It will not offer Tualatin in consumer desktops. "Tualatin was attractive for notebooks, but we felt that we've got an AMD solution so that Tualatin didn't make a lot of sense" for consumer desktops, said Will Townsend, senior manager of marketing for retail desktops in Compaq's Consumer Products Group.;

2002-01-02 - Fiorina to unleash HP's latest weapon in server wars

Article:
Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina will unveil the first incarnation of the company's new high-end "Superdome" Unix server in New York on Sept. 12, sources said. HP will unveil the systems gradually, sources familiar with the strategy said. Fiorina will launch the first, using 32 processors, they said. A 64-processor model will arrive later this year, Duane Zitzner, head of HP's hardware division, told News.com in a July interview. Superdome is the flagship of HP's effort to regain its strength in the Unix server market, which Sun Microsystems dominates and which IBM is aggressively courting. The market also has seen the arrival of major new server designs with Compaq Computer's Wildfire systems and SGI's Origin 3000 series. HP representatives declined to comment beyond saying the computer maker planned to launch the servers in the middle of September along with several services. They added that Superdome machines will help in HP's effort to target Sun. HP's Unix server business had been on the rebound earlier this year, but weak sales last quarter sent HP's stock down. Unix servers are increasingly popular, partly because of the general increase in demand for servers spurred by the Internet, but also because Unix servers using 64-bit CPUs are able to address large amounts of memory and therefore use large databases. Though Intel currently doesn't have any 64-bit chips, the arrival of Itanium-based servers next year will change that, and Intel hopes its standard servers will sell better than custom designs from Compaq, IBM, HP, SGI and Sun. HP, the company that initially developed the design for Itanium and later members of Intel's IA-64 family, has been selling Unix servers that will work with either IA-64 chips or HP's own PA-RISC design. The N-class Unix server, a machine that uses up to eight processors and was unveiled last year, was the first designed to use either chip. HP later introduced lower-end A-class and L-class servers with the same design. Superdome will continue this trend, replacing the V-class machine that can use only PA-RISC chips. Sun can't seem to build enough of its high-end E10000 servers, despite the aging design and the arrival in 2001 of its replacement, code-named Serengeti. In the last quarter, Sun sold 500 of its E10000s, a fifth of the total sold over the several-year history of the product, which originally was designed by Cray. IBM argues that its S80 Unix servers are faster than the E10000, but analysts point to other elements of customer choice besides raw performance, including support or software availability. IBM's S80s, which use 24 of IBM's Power chips to the 64 in Sun's E10000, are less expensive, generally costing less than $1 million where E10000s cost more than $1 million. IBM is readying a successor, code-named Regatta, that will use 32 processors. Sources expect the Superdome machines to generally cost more than $1 million. Using a high-speed connection technology, 64-processor Superdome machines will be able to be grouped into foursomes with 256 processors, Zitzner said. HP this year upgraded its version of Unix, called HP-UX, so it can communicate with as many as 256 CPUs. Sun's servers enjoy "strong market momentum," Meta Group analyst Brian Richardson said in an Aug. 11 report, but IBM and HP currently offer more bang for the buck. "Our research indicates growing unease at Sun accounts. Unlike the competitive landscape just two years ago, the performance of Sun's systems is being overshadowed by more competitive offerings from IBM and Hewlett-Packard," he said. Though the upgrade to the Serengeti systems and the UltraSparc III CPU will offer doubled or tripled performance, "UltraSparc III is at least nine months late," he said. Unix servers in general, however, still will outnumber Windows NT servers for high-end jobs through 2003 or 2004, Richardson said. SGI's new Origin 3000 series servers are respected, though the financially unsteady company is focusing on niche markets much smaller than the broader marketing salvos unleashed by IBM, Compaq, Sun and HP. SGI sold two 512-processor Origin 3800 systems to NASA, which will combine them into a single 1,024-processor behemoth for researching aeronautics, Earth science and biology. SGI also sold a 512-processor Origin 3800 to the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, the company said. The Army Research Lab also bought one 256-processor and one 512-processor model.;

2002-01-02 - Bishop takes the heat as SGI mounts recovery effort

Article:
"You're welcome to pull the arrows out of my back." This is how SGI chief executive Bob Bishop jokes about attacks he took from investors and Wall Street for streamlining the company during the past year. Once known as Silicon Graphics, SGI morphed during the year from a company selling supercomputers, large servers, multimedia software and embedded chips used in consumer devices into one catering to just a few markets: technical and scientific computing and digital content creation. Along the way, Bishop shed four divisions, including the well-known Cray Computer operation, and advanced SGI's aggressive push into Linux. But the changes meant a continuous string of one-time charges and uncertainty about SGI's future. The company's stock price plummeted, and Bishop had the misfortune of delivering quarter after quarter of losses. Bishop took the hot seat Aug. 23, 1999. With his first year at SGI's helm behind him, new products to market and the start of a new fiscal year, Bishop is optimistic, feisty and even psychic. He told CNET News.com's Joe Wilcox that he expects a return to profitability in fiscal 2001. CNET News.com: You took it on the chin from Wall Street over the streamlining. Bishop: I decided to take all the hits. I knew when I came to this job I'd have to take the hits, and I took the hits. All of those steps had consequences: a number of one-shot charges in the books as we do this. The financial community had to look closely at what was going on, because it affected our tax position, affected our revenue position, head count, cost of goods, gross margins, every number. I spent a year trying to explain this. I'm actually happy that in our fiscal 2000, which ended June 30, we really got through it all. I'm just delighted we're off to such a fresh start in fiscal 2001, and we have the entire product portfolio to the market. Those steps you took involved cutting loose four divisions. What can you tell me about letting Cray go? I divested four pieces to get simplicity, clarity and full alignment. That's why I did it. We started by divesting Cray, so we're out of the vector (computing) business. We could not marry...a vector and parallel (computing) architecture. There's a religious difference, and we rightly concluded this marriage doesn't work, so we divested the vector piece and kept 800 Cray people and the lion's share of the technology. We chose the pieces to integrate with the parallel architecture. We're quite happy with what we did. And now the 800 people from Cray that stayed with us are highly motivated SGI people. There's no religious difference anymore. You also cut loose your MIPS chip business and some share value with it. Why? We're 100 percent committed to the MIPS-Irix product line. We had built an embedded chip business, embedded into consumer products. It was highly successful; there were approximately 50 million chips per year being shipped into consumer products. For example, Sony PlayStation...and...Nintendo 64--they all run on MIPS. Laser printers, automobiles, and all different products. But it did not fulfill our mission, our sweet spot, focused on the technical computing user from a system point of view. So we divested that. Keep in mind the designers for the high-end MIPS are still in our company. And we have a road map to take MIPS from 400 MHz today out through 1 GHz in the near future. Where are you now after the divestitures? The consequences on the remaining part of the company--about 6,800 employees--is a highly focused, streamlined operation focused on a single mission. And the sweet spot of that single mission is the technical communities. You are now focusing on technical and scientific computing and creative content, such as film production. But haven't you backed yourself into a niche market? Our revenue is only about $2.5 billion, but we estimate that market to be $25 billion. We only have 10 percent of that market and lots of room to grow. You've had a string of unprofitable quarters. Do you expect a turnaround during fiscal 2001? We've given guidance to Wall Street at our last call on July 20 that we would be profitable for the full fiscal year 2001 and that we would be growing the revenues somewhere between 15 and 20 percent. That's the guidance we gave Wall Street, and we're on target to do that. So you are 100 percent confident the rough times are over? We did the turn. Emotionally, the company's turned. And it's getting runs on the board. Getting runs on the board is pretty important to Wall Street. You can't change their game. That's their game. We're back. We're back quite strong. The products are great, and the motivation in the company's quite high right now. What's one of SGI's biggest failings? We've sown the seeds of innovation but failed to harvest them. Someone else has come along with stronger marketing capability or putting in lower-cost systems and found a way to harvest our work. I'm anxious to learn how to harvest more of what we sow. We are truly respected as the central innovator in this space, but we truly have not harvested volume, nor profits, from this effort. In July, you unveiled the Origin 3000 server and pinned much of the company's future on the product line. How is it doing? We had $100 million in advance orders and feel strong about what we have to offer. These new products are mind-boggling. These new servers have got attention. Now we've got to deliver these new products in volume, and we are dealing with a number of supply constraints in the industry, which are affecting everybody at this moment. Component shortages have hit everyone hard. How are you dealing with the problem? It's amazing how this problem is permeating the industry. We're clawing our way through it. It's a day-by-day struggle with our vendors, but we've got most of our componentry pinned down. We don't have as much upside as we want. Because we are at a point of takeoff and our booking stream is quite strong, we would like to be able to deliver more rapidly. I understand you expect Linux to account for half of SGI's revenue within five years. How does your Linux strategy interact with your proprietary technology? We offer a full line of Linux products, but only on Intel (processors). We don't offer the crossover. We're not putting Linux on MIPS. When Intel has its Itanium processor on the market, we will soon have a full range of IA-64 Linux products. The architecture is already done. The subsystems are already done. It draws upon what we've done on the MIPS-Irix side, so we don't have to redevelop this. So we're ready to go, and we think Intel will have the chip ready by the end of the year. Then our systems will follow probably in the March time frame next year. Linux is gaining momentum, but don't you think your revenue plans are aggressive? No one can truly predict the potential for Linux, but our scope of it is that it's, firstly, tightly linked to the Internet world. I think today it already occupies probably 25 percent of the servers in the Internet space. We're very focused on broadband Internet. Our servers we're looking to deploy in a broadband Internet space, where scalability and throughput become imperative. We're not talking about alphanumeric data, but visual content, interactive content, immersed content and continuous changing content. That's the world of broadband Internet. So you're talking about leveraging your technology used in creative content areas, such as film editing and digital film creation? Yes. And not just old-generation movies, the archive movies. We're talking about new-generation movies that have an interactive content component, where the viewer is immersed and has some dialog with the characters and plot. We haven't yet seen the Internet next-generation, new genre content. But if you had to compare it to anything, it would be the video game environment extended over the Internet with multiple players. That kind of content is very sophisticated, involving high-speed access to big databases. We're ready to deliver that with our new architecture. What kind of business opportunities do you foresee in this market? We think media will be sold and transacted, and instead of e-commerce we really should be talking about media commerce. That transition is under way because of the emergence of broadband Internet. We're gearing ourselves for broadband Internet. We see our new architecture fitting into that space, and Linux will be the gateway to broadband Internet. Do you plan to do more with marketing? Say, promoting your technology's use to make successful movies? We have come to a kind of rebirth, the relaunching of the company. We have committed some pretty significant funds to global promotion. For example, it's on our platform that "The Perfect Storm" special effects were developed. It's on our platform that the whole "Space Cowboys" simulations and special effects were developed. I can go on discussing this, whether you're talking "Toy Story" or "Jurassic Park." It's our stuff, and we have not taken advantage of this as we should have. For example, "The Perfect Storm" is a global phenomenon. It's a cult. And the animation and special effects are just phenomenal. We should be riding along, and our promotion should match what we've done for those customers. If you had one thing you would like to communicate to your customers, competitors and Wall Street, what would that be? We're back.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Intel accelerates plans to release high-speed chips

Article:
On Monday Intel released the 800-MHz Pentium III processor ahead of its original schedule, and apparently that's just the tip of the iceberg. The Santa Clara, Calif., manufacturer has advanced its "road map" for 2000, and will come out with 850-MHz and 866-MHz Pentium IIIs in the year's first quarter, according to a presentation obtained by the HardOCP hardware discussion site. In addition, a 1-GHz Pentium III has been added to the chip giant's plans and is scheduled to appear in the fourth quarter of 2000. Intel declined to comment on unannounced plans. But moving up the release dates of these and other chips is in line with the company's previous response to increased competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices. "That's absolutely consistent with this week's actions," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood, referring to Monday's announcement of the top-end 800-MHz Pentium III. "Intel always has to have in reserve three or four speed grades so they can continue the quarterly progression that has become a fact of the market." The flagship Pentium III will make a pit stop at 933 MHz in the third quarter while Celeron, the processor for budget computers, will rise to speeds of 633 MHz and beyond next year. A processor with integrated graphics capabilities, code-named Timna, will debut at the end of the third quarter at 600 MHz. In addition, a host of chipsets, the silicon which serves as a bridge between the processor and the rest of the computer, will come out as well, according to the document. These chipsets will run at 100 MHz and 133 MHz and will work with Rambus memory or standard memory running at different speeds. The main reason for the advanced schedule is Athlon,  AMD's performance processor. The chip has received rave reviews from benchmark testers, who have noted that Athlons and Pentium III run neck-and neck with AMD taking the edge in certain tests but losing in others. Perhaps more important, AMD has not hit any debilitating manufacturing snags, a problem the company had in the past. As a result, Intel is pushing its monster-sized, worldwide manufacturing capabilities to pump out faster chips in less time than ever before. "They are really concerned about AMD," said Linley Gwennap, publisher of the Microprocessor Report. "AMD has Intel sweating." Perhaps deliberately, Intel sprang the news of the 800-MHz chip at the beginning of a two-week holiday at AMD, whose representatives were not available for comment. "It's getting to be like with Clinton and Congress," when the president makes announcements when Congress isn't in session, Brookwood quipped. However, Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD "clearly is positioned to come back with an 800-MHz product early in the year," likely before Jan. 6, Brookwood said. The arrival of the 1-GHz Pentium III is also interesting, Brookwood said. "There was general concern that the current Coppermine core would max out at 933 MHz," he said. Coppermine is the newest Pentium III design, introduced in October. The Intel chip road map also shows a growing gap between the higher-end Pentium III chips and their lower-end Celeron brethren. The clock speed difference between the two lines was only 100 MHz at the beginning of this quarter, with Celerons running at 500 MHz and Pentium IIIs at 600 MHz. But a year from now that gap will be more than 300 MHz, when Pentium IIIs will have hit 1 GHz but the Celeron will still be in the 600-MHz range. In addition, the Pentium IIIs will benefit from a faster system for communicating with memory. Intel wants to let the development pace of the Celerons slow down to make sure they don't compete with high-end chips with comparable performance, Brookwood said. "It got to be a problem, with clock rates at the low end more or less tracking what was at the high end. It was getting hard to defend [buying] an $800 processor when you could get a $150 processor that seemingly had the same level of performance." With AMD mostly focusing on the high end, Intel can be a bit more complacent with the Celerons, Brookwood said. Still, AMD will keep pressure on with new versions of its budget K6-2 and K6-3. A discount version of the Athlon will also come out mid-2000. Separately, Intel will be coming out with its first 64-bit chip, Itanium, toward the middle of 2000. The company is currently shipping prototype processors running at between 500 MHz and 600 MHz to computer makers for testing. When released, Itanium will run at much higher speeds, Brookwood said. Though Intel has advanced its chip schedule, the fastest chips will be scarce. For instance, Dell and Gateway both announced 800-MHz systems yesterday. A Dell spokeswoman admitted, however, that it takes about 20 days to prepare and ship an 800-MHz computer, putting delivery into the next year. Computers with slower processors can be at the consumer's door in five days. Part of the acceleration also comes from a fundamental change in Intel's business practices. Until recently, Intel would manufacture thousands of new chips before announcing them so that there were ample supplies of PCs in the sales channel. Now, the company is announcing chips when only limited supplies are available, which allows Intel to release the chips at a faster rate. An Intel spokesman said that this pattern should continue in the future, especially as more PC companies move to the build-to-order manufacturing method. Ironically, AMD has been hurt in the past by an inability to manufacture enough chips to meet the demands of PC makers, noted Microprocessor Report's Gwennap, a track record that Intel executives have been known to mention. AMD may be able to go on the offensive with plans to introduce chips that have faster copper technology and special high-speed "cache" memory built into the chip. "If AMD can accomplish those two things on schedule, they would be in a position to put a little bit of distance between themselves and Intel by late in the second quarter," Brookwood said. "In the past, watching Intel compete with AMD was a really dull tennis match. Intel would serve the ball and AMD would never be able to return it," Brookwood said. "Now, Intel serves, and AMD so far has demonstrated a pretty good ability to return those serves.";

2002-01-02 - VA Linux shares jump on strong earnings report

Article:
Shares in VA Linux Systems climbed by more than 18 percent today, fueled by a report of stronger-than-expected revenue. Late yesterday, the company surpassed analyst expectations by reporting revenue of $50.7 million and a loss of 10 cents a share, a nickel better than analysts predicted. Shares were up $6.88 to $44 at the close of regular trading. Analysts generally expected revenue between $42.7 million and $44.5 million, and those surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected a loss of 15 cents a share. In the same quarter a year ago, VA had a net loss of 34 cents a share on revenue of $7.8 million. VA's net loss was $4.1 million, compared with $7.8 million the year before, the company said. The 10-cent loss excludes several items, including "write-off of in-process research and development, amortization of goodwill and intangible assets, amortization of compensation expense related to acquisitions, amortization of deferred stock compensation, and the dividend related to convertible preferred stock," VA said. ABN Amro analyst Keith Bachman and Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Amit Chopra both predicted next quarter's revenue will be about $65 million. "We see VA Linux continuing to exploit Linux's entry into new markets such as midrange servers and storage," Chopra said. The company's sales came chiefly from sales of rack-mountable servers used to build up Internet infrastructure, chief executive Larry Augustin said in an interview today. The most popular product is 3.5 inches thick, but future demand is moving to models 1.75 inches thick, he said. In addition, the company expects sales of servers packed with hard disks to be popular. Augustin predicted revenue next fiscal year to be 2.5 to 2.75 times this year's $120 million--$300 million to $330 million--but that still likely won't be enough to carry the company to profitability. "We're expecting to be in the black by the end of calendar 2001," the second quarter of VA's fiscal year, Augustin said. WR Hambrecht analyst Prakesh Patel sees VA's profit margins increasing. Several acquisitions by VA "show the solid progress VA has made" in shifting its revenue stream to high-margin professional services, hardware and software integrated to work together. The company's products sell to Internet service providers, customers needing data storage and Internet infrastructure, and all high-growth markets. VA's results mean Linux companies have surpassed analyst expectations twice in two days. Linux seller Caldera Systems yesterday reported a loss of 19 cents a share when analysts expected a loss of 25 cents. Caldera, though, had revenues of $1.2 million, much less than VA's. Though VA's growth has been swift, it still faces formidable competition. Dell Computer, IBM and others have aggressive plans to sell Linux servers, but those companies have deep relationships with customers, resellers and suppliers. And Sun Microsystems' $5 billion in revenue last quarter is 100 times that of VA. VA has some features its bigger siblings lack. The company touts its Linux experience, of course, but it also has a new build-to-order software system that lets customers choose in great detail what Linux software they want installed and save configurations for future purchases. VA expects these features to help build repeat business. The company also competes with other Linux companies, such as Red Hat, Caldera, SuSE, TurboLinux, Atipa, Penguin Computing, SteelEye and Mission Critical Linux. VA doesn't see any need to stray from designs based on Intel CPUs, Augustin said. Intel is an investor in VA. VA will be able to expand into new markets with the arrival of Intel's first 64-bit chip, Itanium, and its successor, code-named McKinley, Augustin said. "Clearly the driving application is big databases," which require 64-bit chips' ability to contain large amounts of memory, Augustin said. VA plans eight-processor servers for Itanium machines, he said. Currently, Linux isn't able to take good advantage of all those CPUs, but a new version is due soon. About 8 percent of VA's revenue in the last quarter came from services and from corporate sponsorship of its Open Source Developer Network, Augustin said. In the long run, VA expects about 15 percent of its revenue to be from services and 10 percent from its OSDN. OSDN, unveiled last week, collects news and other information from a number of VA-owned content sites including Linux.com, Slashdot, Freshmeat and SourceForge. Compaq, EMC, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, IBM and Sun are "technology partners" of OSDN, VA said. Meanwhile, many early investors have been selling shares in the company. Computer maker SGI sold 800,000 shares for about $31.5 million total today and yesterday. Two weeks ago, the company sold 350,000 shares for $15 million. Hughes Aircraft's retirement fund sold about 35,000 shares today for nearly $2 million. And the William Hambrecht Trust sold about 55,000 yesterday for $2.3 million. "While there continues to be insider selling, the majority of these are small amounts of stock from venture capital distributions. There have been no large blocks sold by key, operations-involved employees," Patel said.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - New era dawns for Intel servers

Article:
Intel servers are getting nearly as brawny as their Unix server cousins as the chip giant attempts to elbow its way into the high-end market. IBM next year will launch a new server that can accommodate as many as 16 Intel CPUs, said Tom Bradicich, director of architecture and technology for IBM's Netfinity line of Intel servers. Hewlett-Packard yesterday announced a partnership to sell a competing 16- and 32-CPU design from Unisys and will bring Intel CPUs to its own top-end 64-processor server design in the second half of 2002, said Duane Zitzner, head of HP's computer systems group. Compaq Computer, meanwhile, is working on a chip set that will enable 16- and 32-CPU Intel servers using Intel's second-generation 64-bit McKinley chips in early 2002, said Mary McDowell, general manager of Compaq's industry-standard server division. The new systems are at the beginning of a new era for Intel servers, which are benefiting from a host of new technologies that should help them compete better against traditional Unix server designs from Sun Microsystems, HP, Compaq and others. Until now, Intel servers generally have not been able to crack into the high-end market for tasks such as housing huge databases. One of those new components is Windows 2000 Datacenter, the first version of Windows that can run on systems with 32 processors. Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer unveiled Datacenter yesterday in San Francisco, but the new operating system is not expected to grow much beyond test usage for months. Intel, expanding from its tight alliance with Microsoft, also has been pushing Linux and IBM's AIX 5L, formerly known as by its project name, Monterey. Meanwhile, Sun is busy with its own server revamp, selling its first servers based on the UltraSparc III chip today. Meta Group says Microsoft's development of Windows 2000 Datacenter is in part triggering IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq to all announce plans to market 16- and 32-processor Intel-based servers. see commentary Until Compaq comes up with its own design, it will offer the 32-processor Unisys ES7000, the company announced earlier this year. McDowell said Compaq shipments will begin next week. HP will start selling the ES7000 at the start of next year, Zitzner said. Both the HP and IBM designs accommodate not only today's 32-bit Intel processors but also next year's 64-bit Itanium chips from Intel, Bradicich and Zitzner said. Large databases--and thus corporate customers--demand the use of 64-bit chips to run large databases. The new IBM system is based on a new chip set, code-named Summit, Bradicich said. The first Summit-based servers will be released in 2001 along with Foster, the server version of the upcoming Pentium 4, and a later version will arrive with McKinley, the successor to the 64-bit Itanium chip due in 2002. HP, meanwhile, won't rely on Unisys forever for its high-end Intel systems. The new 64-processor Superdome Unix server will be able to use upcoming 64-bit Intel chips in the second half of 2002, HP has said. Intel and HP co-developed the much-delayed IA-64 chip line, and HP has been moving gradually to transfer its servers to the new chip architecture. Superdome currently uses HP's PA-RISC chips. The IBM design consists of as many as four processor "quads," each with four processors, its own memory and input-output abilities. The quads can communicate over a high-speed "scalability port," a technology that came from IBM's 1999 acquisition of Sequent. The IBM design will incorporate a number of higher-end features as well, Bradicich said, including the ability to swap out memory modules without shutting the server off, a first for Intel servers. The architecture works up to 16-CPU systems, but IBM also plans to sell it in smaller systems with four, eight or 12 processors. In a four-way configuration, IBM hopes to squeeze the chips into a rack-mounted server just 1.75 inches thick--a difficult engineering accomplishment given the heat that chips generate. Compaq also is working on a chipset that will enable eight-processor Foster systems, McDowell said.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Dell expands Linux commitment with Red Hat deal

Article:
The prospects for Linux got rosier today as Dell Computer joined the parade of PC makers working to make the relatively new operating system more appealing to big business. Linux seller Red Hat will be a prime beneficiary of the move. Dell, which is well behind Compaq Computer in sales of Linux systems, will work with Red Hat to beef up marketing, support and Linux itself, the companies announced today. Dell has been the computer maker most closely aligned with Microsoft and Intel--the two halves of the "Wintel" alliance--but today's news marks a new step back from Microsoft. Under the new arrangement, Dell will elevate Linux to the status of Microsoft Windows and Novell Netware, building ties with Red Hat's programmers, customer support team, sales force and others. "There's a lot of marketing hype around this, but I think it is a pretty significant announcement that Dell wants to push Linux," said Technology Business Research analyst Brooks Gray. "They're straying more from the Microsoft platform. And clearly they've had a lot of demand for (Linux)." Though financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, Red Hat expects to make money by getting new customers in big business, said Red Hat chief executive Matthew Szulik. These sort of deals are central to Red Hat's future. Because Linux software can be obtained for free, Red Hat and others expect to thrive by offering Linux-related services. Chairman Robert Young has said that eventually, the company could become the Wal-Mart of the Linux world, offering a panoply of products and services. Dell, for its part, hopes the alliance will increase pressure on traditional rivals IBM, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems by allowing Dell to sell more equipment to build up the Internet, said Mike Lambert, senior vice president of Dell's enterprise systems group. As first reported by CNET News.com, Dell looked at embracing Unix to compete better in an Internet-dominated computing world. In February, Dell settled on using Linux instead, though it didn't rule out a version of Unix called Monterey under development from IBM and Santa Cruz Operation. Linux is a clone of Unix, similar in design and function though not as battle-tested or as able to run on super-powerful servers. Lambert acknowledged the lead traditional Unix has over Linux but argued that Dell isn't interested in taking on the entire Unix server market and that its alliance with Red Hat will help improve Linux. "I think it's a fair statement that at the very high end of processing, there are five-nines kind of requirements (that a computer stay up and running 99.999 percent of the time) that have been baked into Unix variants over the last five to 10 years. That's really not where we're aiming at this point in time," Lambert said. The Dell-Red Hat alliance fits well with the strategy of Intel, which like Dell has invested in Red Hat. Intel views Linux as one of three major operating systems that will prevail on its upcoming Itanium chip and its successors in the "IA-64" family, along with Windows and Monterey. Though Dell and Red Hat called today's initiative the "one-source alliance," Red Hat is hardly the sole source for Linux products and services at Dell. Dell executives said the company will in fact maintain its relationships with TurboLinux and Linuxcare, two Red Hat competitors. Dell sells computers in Japan and elsewhere in Asia using TurboLinux's version of Linux, said Russ Holt, general manager of Dell's workgroup server group. And though Red Hat is the default company to provide support for Linux computers sold by Dell, customers may select Linuxcare as well, Lambert said. In the alliance, Dell and Red Hat will work jointly to improve Linux's high-end abilities with technologies such as clustering, which ties together multiple servers to share workload or step in for one another if one fails, Szulik said. In addition, Dell and Red Hat will work to tune Linux for specific hardware designs such as Dell's special-purpose PowerApp servers. Keeping servers up and running around the clock means more opportunity for services revenue for Dell and Red Hat. Ensuring that level of performance requires a lot of planning as well as ongoing monitoring when the system is up and running, services for which companies charge premium rates. Though customers will pay Dell for such services, some of the money will flow to Red Hat, depending on who's actually doing the job, Holt said. High-availability services also require close collaboration between the hardware and software developers, added Red Hat chief technical officer Michael Tiemann. "It's now possible to align the hardware and software," he said. The companies will work together to prepare Linux for Intel's Itanium chip. Dell and Red Hat also announced today that automaker Toyota will buy 1,400 Dell computers with Red Hat software to serve as information kiosks in all Toyota and Lexus dealerships in the United States.;

2002-01-02 - THE DAY AHEAD AMD 'reasonably uncrushable' vs Intel

Article:
This just in: Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD) has proclaimed itself "reasonably uncrushable" when it comes to battling its larger nemesis Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC). We'd take it a step farther and say AMD has graduated from being a chimp to a gorilla. Now there are two 800-pound gorillas in the chip market. Luckily for us, the gorilla warfare is entertaining. AMD checked in with its latest quarterly results Wednesday and threw in a stock split for good measure. The company reported second quarter net income of $207.1 million, or $1.21 per share. First Call's survey of 18 analysts predicted an AMD profit of $1.14 per share for the quarter ended July 2. A higher tax rate also masked what could have been even higher earnings. Sales were up 7 percent sequentially to $1.17 billion. Exactly a year ago, AMD was losing tons of cash. The results, coupled with strong demand that only "an act of God" could derail, had AMD officials giddy. And why not? AMD has been running circles around Intel, which has had numerous problems and took a $200 million charge to replace defective motherboards in its second quarter. In the chip race, AMD is giving Intel a great run with strong products. In addition, AMD's quarter was refreshing because it was clean and easy to understand. Translation: No major investment gains to puff up results. Intel's quarter was messy to say the least. The company had a $2.1 billion investment gain in its second quarter. Back that gain out and Intel doesn't look so hot. In fact, operating earnings were flat. Of course, Intel gets a free pass on Wall Street. Of 33 analysts only three are cautious on the stock. No matter how many glitches, odd financial items or body blows Intel takes from AMD, analysts are usually cheery despite the challenges. "We believe that Intel will likely outperform in the second half," said Scott Randall, an analyst at Wit SoundView, who reiterated a "strong buy" rating Wednesday. But even the biggest cheerleaders have a few concerns. Ashok Kumar, of USB Piper Jaffray, said Intel "left some money on the table" by underestimating demand in recent quarters. Meanwhile, AMD keeps making a lot of noise. On a conference call with analysts, Hector J. Ruiz, president and chief operating officer for AMD, struggled to be negative. "I have to think hard to say something negative," he said. The processor market also looks robust, executives said. Shipments of 1GHz Athlon chips quintupled during the quarter, said Ruiz. "We were able to meet our commitments to all our customers in this high-end segment," Ruiz said, contrasting Athlon's availability with the shortage of Intel's 1GHz Pentium III chips. As for the flash memory market, there's no slowdown in sight. AMD said it is already sold out through the year. Some analysts have said flash memory, which powers wireless devices, was headed for a slowdown. On its core Athlon and Duron processors, AMD was also bullish. The company said shipments will increase to 3.6 million units in the third quarter and to 7.2 million units in the fourth quarter. The growth should provide higher average selling prices. The chip market is fragile and has a history of boom and bust cycles, but for now AMD is booming. Big Blue sees blue skies in second halfAfter three quarters devoid of revenue growth, investors were hoping for any kind of optimism coming from IBM's (NYSE: IBM) second quarter conference call. Big Blue delivered. As far as the second quarter results go, IBM had a ho-hum quarter. The company topped estimates with earnings of $1.06 a share, but sales fell 1 percent year-over-year to $21.7 billion. The outlook, however, was the real focus. The company remains comfortable with analysts' full year earnings estimates, CFO John Joyce said, during a conference call with analysts. First Call currently predicts a profit of $4.36 per share for 2000. Joyce also said he "felt good about our momentum." Joyce said mainframe shipments were perking up (1 percent growth in the second quarter after previous declines), and added the second half looked strong. Joyce even went out on a limb and said the company could hit double-digit revenue growth in the second half. Analysts estimate that IBM will post mid-single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth in the second half. IBM even said its PC division may post a profit by the end of the year. Now that's optimistic.

2002-01-02 - IBM supports new Java version

Article:
Despite its differences with Sun Microsystems, IBM will adopt the new version of Java as soon as possible, the company said. IBM was one of the early backers of Sun's Java software, which theoretically allows a program written in the Java language to run on any Java-enabled computer. However, the company has been unhappy with the degree of control Sun maintains over Java. IBM has said Sun "betrayed" IBM by going back on a verbal promise to turn control of Java over to an industry group. IBM still has Java firmly entrenched in its product line, working to speed up the "virtual machine" component of Java and using Java across its four server lines--the Netfinity, RS/6000, AS/400 and S/390. Sun released Java 2 version 1.3 this week. IBM will release Java 2 version 1.3 software for its four server lines by the summer, the company said. It will run on the Windows, Linux and OS/2 operating systems for Intel-based Netfinity servers. By the end of the year, Java will run on three operating systems on Intel's upcoming Itanium processor.;

2002-01-02 - Sun shines Solaris on new Intel chip

Article:
Sun's Solaris operating system is running on prototypes of Intel's upcoming 64-bit chips, becoming the last of the major server computer operating systems to do so. Sun Microsystems was beaten to the punch by Microsoft, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and the collection of programmers working on adapting the Linux operating system to run on the forthcoming chip. The processor had been code-named Merced but now is called Itanium. The only reason for Sun's lag was that it's hard to get access to the Intel prototype hardware used to test out software, said Jonathan Han, product manager for Solaris on Intel. Solaris is Sun's version of the Unix operating system. "Unfortunately, hardware access has been the gating factor," Han said. Once the company got access, it took less than a week to get Solaris working on the new chip, he said. Getting established operating systems up and running on a new chip is a critical stage in creating products for any processor. An operating system, the special software that's in charge of a computer, is needed before higher-level software such as a financial application or image editor can run. The Itanium will be the first in a new line of chips that will form the "IA-64" family, a new architecture originally conceived at HP. Intel says it will have room to outgrow current high-end chips from IBM, Sun, and Compaq Computer, among others. A version of Windows and Linux were demonstrated when Intel unveiled the first Itanium samples in late August. HP said in September that its version of Unix, called HP-UX, was running on the Itanium prototype. IBM had passed a similar milestone for its new operating system about two weeks earlier, called Monterey-64. Monterey-64 is a combined version of the Unix products from IBM, the Santa Cruz Operation, and Sequent, a server maker IBM acquired. The Unix landscape got a little simpler last month when Compaq reversed its plan to translate its Unix, called Tru-64, to the IA-64 chips. Instead, Tru64 will work only on Compaq's Alpha chips. Sun's servers and workstations are based on Sun's own chip, the UltraSparc, but the company also sells the Solaris OS for Intel chips. However, the current Intel version of Solaris is less powerful, running only on 32-bit chips, whereas the UltraSparc version of Solaris runs on 64-bit chips. A 64-bit operating system is able to deal with much larger amounts of memory and much larger databases of information, important factors for high-end systems that handle tasks such as keeping track of all of a large company's accounts. The advent of the new 64-bit chips from Intel means it will be easier for software companies to make sure their software runs on Intel and UltraSparc system. Software will be about 95 percent alike for the two systems, Han said. The arrival of a 64-bit Solaris on Intel chips won't cause Sun to change its Solaris strategy, Han said.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Glitch prompts Intel to recall 113-GHz Pentiums

Article:
Intel has recalled its fastest chip--the 1.13-GHz Pentium III--saying the chip could cause system errors when running certain programs and at a particular temperature. The problem is with certain circuits of the chip that have been shown to malfunction in laboratory tests under certain conditions, said Intel spokesman Howard High. Intel said it has not received reports from customers of any problems, but the glitch has been noted by some hardware review sites in recent days. As first reported by CNET News.com, Dell Computer and IBM have stopped shipping PCs with the processor. Intel said it will work with those companies to satisfy existing customers. "Clearly if they want a replacement, then we will replace (it)," High said. "If they want a refund, we'll accommodate them." The 1.13-GHz chip began shipping July 31 in limited quantities. Intel would not say exactly how many 1.13 GHz chips have shipped, but analysts said the number is quite small. "There can't be very many--tens of thousands at most," said Linley Gwennap, principal analyst at The Linley Group. "I wouldn't be surprised if it was under 10,000." Word of the glitch comes on the same day as rival Advanced Micro Devices announced shipments of its 1.1-GHz Athlon. Analysts say competition with AMD may have caused Intel to release a chip that wasn't ready. "It sounds like Intel may have pushed a little too hard," said chip analyst Peter Glaskowsky of MicroDesign Resources. "It shows the Pentium III is not really capable of reaching these levels." Gwennap noted that Intel did not originally have the 1.13-GHz chip on its road map and has struggled to produce the 1-GHz chip in enough quantity to satisfy customers. "When you push the clock speed beyond what it was designed to do, you run into problems," Gwennap said. "They rushed to get the 1-GHz chip out, and they couldn't produce enough of them." Intel said it has identified the cause of the problem and will fix it by redesigning the circuits in question. "It's probably a couple of months before we get units back into the marketplace," High said. Although other Pentium III processors have the same design, Intel said it has not found the same problem in other chips. "We've done quite a bit of testing, and we haven't seen anything," High said. Intel said the fact that it had not shipped many of the processors will make the problem easier to remedy than past glitches, such as the bug with the 820 chipset. In that case, computer motherboards with the defective chipset were sold through distributors and available in computers from many retailers. "We're kind of early in the process, which is a benefit with something like this," High said. Only Dell, IBM and a few European companies had been selling systems with the 1.13-GHz chip. Intel said it is recalling chips that have not yet been sold and has halted its shipments of the processor. High said various computer hardware review sites began noting a problem with certain kernels of the Linux operating system. Intel at first could replicate the problem only when the chips were operated outside recommended temperature specifications. Over the weekend, it began noticing problems even within the chip's specifications. Intel executives said it was too soon to say how much the bug might cost, but the cost will not be material to Intel's earnings. In addition to the glitch that forced the recall of the 820 and the delay of the low-end Timna chip, Intel has had delays and performance issues with its forthcoming Itanium chip, which is aimed at high-end servers. Gwennap noted that Intel's manufacturing woes over the past year--and AMD's success--reverse what had been the trend. "For a long time, Intel was this machine that couldn't break and AMD couldn't take two steps without tripping," Gwennap said. "For the past year, Intel has been having problem after problem, and AMD keeps cranking out more and more chips." Gwennap said that while the Pentium III may have hit its limit, Intel will be able to introduce chips at much faster speeds when it debuts the Pentium 4 later this year. The Pentium 4 design "clearly allows higher clock speeds," Gwennap said. "That's one of the reasons they are moving to a new architecture.";

2002-01-02 - The week in review Microsoft survives intact

Article:
Although Microsoft claimed victory after an appeals court this week vacated an order to split it into two companies, legal experts say it may be too early to name a winner in the landmark antitrust case. In a 125-page decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld a previous ruling that Microsoft used illegal conduct to retain its OS monopoly and asked a trial court to determine an appropriate remedy--tossing out the possibility, at least immediately, of a company split. The appeals court also asked the trial court to revisit the controversial issue of tying products such as the browser to Microsoft's ubiquitous PC operating system. For Microsoft, the decision puts it in the hot seat on a number of issues. For one, it potentially places in jeopardy the company's recent Windows XP bundling efforts and plans for .Net. The ruling could also expose Microsoft to huge legal liabilities in potential private lawsuits on behalf of consumers or competitors. In a separate issue, the appeals court said the trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, "seriously tainted the proceedings." It removed him from the case and tossed out his order calling for a Microsoft breakup. XP in turmoil Despite dodging a breakup bullet, Microsoft has a few more issues on its collective plate over the upcoming release of Windows XP. The company's new product-activation technology, which locks Office XP or Windows XP to a particular PC hardware configuration, can deactivate unexpectedly, rendering the software useless until a code number is obtained from Microsoft. The feature could present the biggest headache to people who frequently upgrade or change components on their PCs. Already the activation technology, introduced to thwart piracy and promote software subscriptions, is controversial with some users of the new Office software package. Separately, Microsoft is lightening the load on Windows XP by deciding to exclude Smart Tags--a technology that could alter the Web-surfing habits of millions of consumers--from the version to ship later this year. The company included Smart Tags in the most recent test versions of Windows XP, but a company spokesman said the technology will not be included in the final version that will be released Oct. 25. With Smart Tags, Microsoft can link any word on a Web page to another site chosen by the company. For example, if a person were reading a story about traveling, the word "airline" could include a link that would divert the reader to an airline or travel service chosen by Microsoft. Microsoft, together with Intel, PC makers and retailers, will spend $1 billion promoting Windows XP, the software giant's upcoming operating system. Microsoft and Intel alone will spend $500 million to market Windows XP, which is slated for an Oct. 25 launch, with PC makers and retailers spending another $500 million. Microsoft will spend a combined total of more than $700 million on marketing to launch Windows XP and the Xbox video game console this fall, according to estimates from the company and Merrill Lynch. Xbox is set to debut Nov. 8. Changing directions In a major boost to Intel's Itanium chip, Compaq Computer will license its Alpha chip technology to Intel and will use Itanium in its servers as the PC giant looks to consolidate its operations to focus on software and computer services. Intel, through the Alpha deal, will gain valuable intellectual property from Compaq for use in its chips and a major customer for its Itanium processor. As part of the deal, Compaq eventually will transition all of its server systems to use Itanium processors. In a radical change, VA Linux Systems announced it will stop selling Linux computers July 10, abandoning a business central to the company since its founding in 1993 and its phenomenal initial public offering in 1999. The company also will lay off 35 percent of its staff--about 153 of 436 employees. Leaving hardware means VA instead will work on Linux software, its collaborative programming tools, and its Web site. The move puts VA into closer competition with software specialists such as Red Hat and CollabNet. Napster is forcing people who want to trade music through its file-swapping site to upgrade to a severely restricted version that allows trading of only a fraction of the songs previously available. People who signed onto the site on Thursday were greeted with a message telling them their older software would no longer work. "All previous versions of Napster have been disabled," the message says. "We're making this change as part of our ongoing effort to comply with the court's orders." PC Expo: On the go There wasn't much PC in PC Expo this year, as portable computers and handhelds took over the convention floor. Aiming to restore confidence in his struggling company, Palm CEO Carl Yankowski announced several new deals designed to attract more corporate customers. Under one deal, Big Five accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers will begin recommending Palm handhelds to clients as a way to increase profits by making employees more productive. The two companies will work together to help businesses incorporate handhelds into their existing information-technology systems. They also will develop and market products that give companies mobile access to existing software such as customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning programs. Compaq is working to create the "iPaq Economy" by dramatically increasing the selection of add-on modules for the handheld. The PC company showed off several upcoming expansion packs, including those for a cell phone, GPS (Global Positioning System) and Bluetooth wireless communication technology. Compaq, not unlike competitors Palm and Handspring, is trying to create additional uses for its handhelds. Company executives hope that additional expansion capabilities will help create an effect similar to what Handspring accomplished with its Springboard expansion slot: drive sales by allowing its devices to be used in a number of new ways. Intel has moved forward in two major areas of the chipmaking process with "Tualatin," the new Pentium III processor the company showed off at PC Expo. Tualatin, also known as Pentium III-M, will initially be used mainly in notebooks. Intel executives said all of the major notebook makers, including Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Dell Computer, Fujitsu and Sony, will adopt the new chip. Tualatin uses Intel's new 0.13-micron manufacturing process, which allows smaller circuits to be printed on the chip, thus increasing the processing power that can be squeezed onto a piece of silicon. Tualatin also marks Intel's entry into the chip industry's copper shift, using the metal to connect circuits on the chip.

Title:
2002-01-02 - Intel looks to software to lift Itanium

Article:
Intel is taking a new look at the software behind its processors to increase performance for future chips. Intel's Microprocessor Research Labs (MRL) established an alliance Wednesday aimed at increasing the performance of compilers for its long-awaited IA-64 processors for servers. The compiler plays a vital role by allowing operating systems, such as Microsoft's Windows, to interact with processors in the most efficient way. A well-tuned compiler is in Intel's best interest, since it can wring the highest performance out of new chips by allowing application software, such as Web servers and transaction processing systems, to take full advantage of a new processor's speed. The MRL, which is responsible for researching new processor designs five to eight years in advance, enlisted the Chinese Academy of Science near Beijing for help with the compiler project. The goal of the project is to augment existing compilers, such as Silicon Graphics' compiler for IA-64 processors, to increase performance of the chips. Intel would like to loosen up the traditionally rigid compiler-design process by creating a new, freely available compiler development framework that would allow easy experimentation. The best of the new ideas, in theory, would go to market with future processors. "We're at a point, particularly with IA-64, where we're looking at testing out a number of novel optimizations," said Wilf Pinfold, MRL's business director. "We're looking for a way to test novel ideas and add new techniques in a modular way." Intel's first IA-64 chip, Itanium, is considered a crucial step in Intel's efforts to challenge Sun Microsystems in the lucrative server market, but the chip has been a long time coming. Originally due at the end of 1999, the chip has been delayed several times since, while Intel worked to complete its design. The company later grappled with clock-speed problems but now plans to release 733MHz and 800MHz versions of the chip. While production-level chips are set to ship this quarter, big-name servers using the chips won't arrive until fall. Adding to the drama, most server makers have greater interest in McKinley, the follow-up to the first Itanium chip. But Intel soldiers on with Itanium and its associated technologies, such as compilers. The compiler's work is long completed by the time computer users boot-up their PCs, but it affects people directly in terms of the performance it lends to or takes away from a processor, either in a desktop PC or in a distant network server. A poorly written compiler can sap performance from a chip, while a well-devised one can help squeeze out extra power. "The continued ability to make processors run more quickly is related to a few things, and one of them is the compiler," Pinfold said. One method for increasing processor performance, known as parallelism, tackles many jobs at the same time, instead of waiting for one to finish before moving on to the next. IA-64 chips already use another performance bump, processing data in 64-bit chunks instead of in the 32-bit chunks used by Pentium chips. Just as a person might speed things along at work by making a phone call while waiting for a PC to boot, a processor would tackle several jobs at once. It could also break a large job into many smaller jobs, which could be processed at the same time. Here, the compiler helps to direct data as these jobs are split between parts of a processor. Intel intends to explore these and other means of boosting processor performance by making the compiler more efficient at handling data. "There are some very interesting and innovative ways to split up tasks" between parts of a processor, Pinfold said. The MRL, which maintains an office in Beijing, will tap the academy's Institute of Computing Technology, where engineers are particularly talented in writing system software such as compilers, Pinfold said. There, a dozen or so engineers will work on the new framework in combination with Intel's MRL compiler-research team of 10 to 15 people. The MRL expects to complete the compiler-framework project in about two years. However, it plans to regularly post developments, such as compiler-code modules, for the researchers to review. Analysts said improving compiler performance could boost the performance of IA-64 chips over time. "Certainly, Intel has enough support for IA-64, but the more ideas you can get behind it the better," said Linley Gwennap, principal researcher at The Linley Group. "In theory, if this compiler technology could give better performance, it would be a rising tide for all boats." But until Intel can prove performance improvements, analysts will remain skeptical that the project is aimed at anything more than drumming up more support for IA-64 chips. "Without knowing exactly what these guys are doing, it's tough to see the value," Gwennap said. By making the compiler framework freely available, Intel believes it can benefit from thousands of extra sets of hands. Researchers would download the framework and its associated software tools and test new twists on compilers designed for Intel chips. "At this stage, you learn a lot from breadth of research. You want to test out a lot of ideas, even if some of them are a bit wacky," Pinfold said. Ultimately, however, Intel expects to directly benefit when new ideas for compilers are tested, proven and then written into production-level compiler software, helping to increase performance of future 64-bit chips. Typically, it takes time to perfect the compiler for a new chip, Pinfold said. Now, "we're trying to do some of that work earlier in the game.";

Title:
2002-01-02 - Commentary A slow assault on Unix

Article:
Intel's 64-bit Itanium chip, expected to be introduced at the end of May, is a major competitive threat to high-end RISC/Unix workstations and servers--but this threat will take some time to develop. Jumping to 64-bit processing is a major See news story: Itanium to arrive at last technical accomplishment for Intel. However, a processor is only part of a full computer system. Other component makers must redesign their peripherals to take advantage of 64-bit processing, and computer manufacturers must design full systems around Itanium, which will require time. This process may be delayed by the promise of a second-generation Itanium chip (McKinley), which is scheduled to be released in about 11 months. We expect some hardware vendors--such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer, and Dell Computer--to introduce initial Itanium systems early to win bragging rights, but the truly commercial systems will be based on McKinley and will be introduced in 2002. The initial systems--particularly 16-way servers from IBM and HP--will expose Unisys's high-end "Wintel" servers as purely tactical offerings. Windows has been 64-bit-enabled for some time and should run on Itanium systems out of the box. However, software vendors must retune their applications for 64-bit processing before they can deliver a real step forward in performance. This is particularly important for the CAD systems that engineers run on high-end Unix workstations. The same need for application retuning has occurred in past shifts to a new processing architecture, such as the move from 16-bit to 32-bit processing. The largest initial market for Itanium servers probably will be small and midsize database servers, because the leading Unix-based database systems are already optimized for 64-bit processing on Unix platforms. We expect the initial Itanium servers to be too expensive to compete for the lower and middle tiers of the three-tier Web server architecture, although they may find a place in security servers. Sixteen-way Itanium servers also may find an early home in the back-end third tier of Web architectures, where their large address space will enable effective management of large amounts of storage and memory and where the software is already optimized for 64-bit computing. Two and three years down the road By 2003, we expect 64-bit versions of key applications to start appearing on the market, and by 2004 Itanium will be competing head to head with Unix/RISC, moving Wintel into the high-end server market for the first time. This will definitely provide major competition for Unix vendors, although exactly how much will depend on price and performance. In the long term, we expect 64-way McKinley servers to deliver huge amounts of performance. But even a 16-way Itanium server this year is not a small platform for the back end. For the rest of 2001 at least, most consumers should generally adopt a "look but don't touch" policy when it comes to Itanium-based servers. The exceptions will occur when a company has applications that started small on Windows NT and have grown rapidly, such as Oracle databases running on NT as the back end of a multitier Web architecture, an arrangement that would benefit from the raw power of the Itanium processor. Consumers should view the pre-McKinley Itanium-based servers mainly as compatibility test beds for the performance of key software and the effect of Itanium servers on their computing environments. They should wait until McKinley to do performance testing--because the second-generation chip will increase performance dramatically--and to bring Itanium into production environments. However, consumers should be aware that any Wintel servers and high-end workstations they buy during the next few months may have a shorter-than-normal life before being replaced with Itanium-based hardware. Also, in a few months as Itanium reaches the marketplace, Intel will reduce the price of its Pentium 4, decreasing the cost and therefore the residual value of units based on that processor.

2002-01-02 - The week in review IBM's missteps

Article:
IBM conceded a series of recent missteps but hopefully described plans for improvement. Meeting with financial analysts, chief executive Lou Gerstner acknowledged the company has been struggling mightily with desktops and server computers, key segments for the computing giant. Restructuring will lead to better sales, he asserted.Big Blue's discontents Topping the list of IBM's shortcomings: faster hard drives for large servers. "We were late; we screwed up the design," Gerstner said. "It cost us in the first quarter, and it's going to cost us again in this quarter." Server storage will account for as much as 75 percent of new corporate hardware spending, he said. News from the PC division hasn't been much brighter. The company called a halt to retail sales in the United States late last year, a move that produced a steep, 42 percent drop in the first-quarter unit sales. Industry share fell to 4 percent from 7.9 percent a year earlier. At the start of the week, IBM introduced its NetVista line to reverse the trend. IBM further bolstered its midrange server line as part of its continuing attempt to close ground on market leader Sun Microsystems. But the fast-growing segment is fiercely competitive. Sun promptly introduced innovative discounts for educational customers.Unrepentant? Microsoft said it would accept restrictions on its business practices if a federal judge dismisses a government proposal to break the software giant in two. Specifically, the company would allow PC makers more freedom to customize the "start-up screen," refrain from using exclusive contracts that encourage PC makers and Internet service providers to favor Microsoft products, and give software developers access to information essential to making their products work well with Windows, among other proposals. The government said Microsoft's apparent lack of contrition makes these empty concessions. In a related matter, a delay in ruling on the government's proposal seems likely. A Filipino computer student admitted he may have released the "Love" bug. The virus has been deemed one of the most destructive ever, affecting more than 600,000 computers and causing an estimated $2.5 billion in damage. Intel acknowledged a problem with components inside some Pentium III computers that causes systems to freeze. Released in November, Intel's "memory translator hub" is used by computer makers that want to incorporate the 820 chipset without using Rambus, a high-cost, high-speed memory technology. The problem could cost Intel several hundred million dollars to fix. Separately, Intel posted the microarchitecture for its upcoming Itanium processor in an unusual effort to make it easier for open-source programmers to build applications for the new chip. Linux appears destined to play a substantial role in the acceptance of Intel's first 64-bit processor.Cut rate Hewlett-Packard cut prices on its leading business PC lines by up to 21 percent. The company has been pulling closer to leaders Compaq and Dell, recently overtaking the latter as the fastest-growing manufacturer with first-quarter 2000 shipment gains of 67 percent domestically and 56 percent worldwide. Dell's quarterly revenues bested last year's figure by more than 30 percent, and its net income improved by more than 20 percent, taking the PC manufacturer well past Wall Street's expectations. The company credited sales of servers, storage devices and PCs associated with use and construction of the Internet. Sony's PlayStation2 will debut with a suggested price tag of $299 in late October, ahead of Nintendo's Dolphin and Microsoft's Xbox, due next year. The new unit is able to play DVD movies and audio CDs, but will not ship with a built-in modem. In response, Sega discounted its Dreamcast to $149. The company also is offering subsidies for customers who sign up for its Internet access service.Surging demand for flash memory, used to store data and programming algorithms in cell phones, digital cameras and MP3 music players, is creating a spiral of consequences for the industry. With sales expected to climb to $10 billion this year from $4.5 billion a year ago, manufacturers such as Intel, AMD, Atmel and Fujitsu are expected to reap substantial profits. At the same time, supply shortages are worsening, which may lead to product delays and rising prices.Self-inflicted The recent flap over whether Time Warner had the right to pull Disney and ABC TV programming from its cable TV systems has raised the question among cable industry leaders: Will the dispute have implications for the regulation of broadband Internet content? Separately, CMGI is rallying Internet companies to demand further government scrutiny of America Online's pending merger with Time Warner, citing AOL's refusal to open its instant messaging services to rivals. MP3.com offered an olive branch to the record industry, agreeing to remove all major-label content from its controversial My.MP3.com service. The company was sued in January by the Recording Industry Association of America and the five big music labels, and last month lost an important round in court. The fight over MP3.com's service has helped sketch how far Web companies can stretch the boundaries of copyright law as they seek to expand their offerings online. Napster said it blocked 317,377 user screen names that have been identified by Metallica as allegedly infringing on the rock band's copyrights, but let members know that they have a way to appeal their eviction. Meanwhile, a few tech-savvy subscribers figured out a way around the ban and started posting instructions for the others on Napster's online bulletin boards. Many political portals may lack sustainable business models to carry them beyond the November presidential election. Political information is generally free and advertising dollars aren't flowing in because traffic figures are low. Some predict that e-government sites will suffer the same fate as medical and health information services, which launched with a flourish but fizzled by the end of last year. Commercial email--mail selling products and services--is expected to increase 40-fold by 2005, with marketers spending about $7.3 billion a year to send it, according to a study. The average number of marketing messages online consumers receive per year was 40 in 1999, and may rise to more than 1,600 in 2005. Sixty-five percent of companies are spending up to 5 percent of their marketing budgets on email marketing, cutting into direct mail.Also of note Sun Microsystems boosted the speed of its popular Java software for desktop systems, but distribution challenges may slow adoption of the performance update ? Microsoft is nearing completion of Windows Me and is expected to release the new consumer operating system sometime in June ? The House voted to extend the ban on Internet taxes for five more years ? The Republican-led branch House also hopes to ease restrictions on the number of visas given to foreigners with technical skills, another move favored by the high-tech industry, but the Clinton administration is trying to finesse the issue ?

2002-01-02 - AMD seeks Linux developers for 64-bit chip software

Article:
Advanced Micro Devices is putting money and energy into recruiting Linux developers to write software for Hammer, the company's 64-bit processor that will first appear in late 2001. Under an initiative announced today at LinuxWorld in San Jose, Calif., AMD said that is has created a Web site for Linux developers and will ship participants a "technology simulator" of the chip next month so that the companies can begin to move their operating systems and applications to Hammer. AMD will also fund other Linux-Hammer related initiatives, sources have said. The move parallels the approach taken by AMD rival Intel, which invested in VA Linux Systems and helped other companies bring Linux to its upcoming 64-bit Itanium chip. The company essentially is trying to make it as easy and as inexpensive as possible for companies to write software for the processor. Executives from Red Hat Software, SuSE and other Linux companies saluted the move. Hammer, which was earlier code-named Sledgehammer, is AMD's most ambitious project to date. The chip will run software designed for 32-bit processors, such as Intel's Pentium III and AMD's Athlon, as well as software for 64-bit chips, a class of processors that includes Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc, Compaq Computer's Alpha and Intel's upcoming Itanium. Samples of Hammer will emerge in late 2001, with commercial availability likely following in 2002, Bob Mitton, division marketing manager at Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD, said last week. Moving to 64-bit chips--as long as there's an operating system and other software that can take advantage of them--enables the use of much larger databases and other advantages. For this shift, though, the companies have chosen different paths. Intel has chosen to develop a completely new language, called IA-64, for communicating with Itanium and subsequent 64-bit chips. Sledgehammer, though, uses an architecture AMD calls x86-64, an extension of Intel's 32-bit architecture. However, to run on these new chips, Linux and its accompanying programming tools must know how to speak the chips' native tongues. AMD began releasing details on how to communicate with Sledgehammer earlier this week. SuSE said one of its programmers, Jan Hubicka, has produced the first versions of programming tools necessary to develop Linux and other software for Sledgehammer. Other companies involved in AMD's x86-64 effort include CodeSourcery, which has experience in programming tools, scientific and technical computing firm Portland Group, and others. SuSE, a German company that is one of the four major sellers of the Unix-like operating system, plans to hold an initial public offering, chief technology officer Dirk Hohndel has said. With its primary use on servers today, Linux could provide a new way for AMD to attack the business market. To date, AMD's chips have been used almost exclusively in consumer computers. With the upcoming Mustang chip and Sledgehammer, however, the company will try to enter the market for corporate desktops and servers. AMD is already gaining peripheral penetration into the corporate market. Net Express, a small server and workstation specialist in the San Francisco Bay Area, has sold single-processor Athlon servers running Linux to a number of established companies, said Roland Baker, Net Express CEO. Penguin Computing CEO Sam Ockman, however, added that AMD will need to popularize chipsets for making multiprocessor servers before commercial acceptance of their chips takes off. Penguin is actually dropping Athlon from one of its server lines. AMD's first multiprocessor server chipset comes out later this year. "For our market, what we need a server to be is rack-mount friendly and capable of multiprocessing," Ockman said. Still, other small companies and even motherboard makers have said that they are seeing a shift in resistance to AMD in corporations. The 32- and 64-bit designations refer to the amount of data that a processor can handle in a single instruction: The larger the number, the more information the chip can digest in one gulp. With 64-bit chips, server makers also can incorporate much more memory into their machines, the key feature for speeding up access to large databases. Sledgehammer will use the same basic instruction set as the Athlon but will contain features that allow the chip to run 64-bit programs. As a result, software makers need only retrofit their existing programs, not write completely new ones. "This is the conservative step approach. It is not a major disruption," Bob Mitton, division marketing manager at AMD, said earlier this month. "If it's not broke, why fix it?";

2002-01-02 - STOCKS TO WATCH Intel Microsoft and Vodafone

Article:
Expect the following technology stocks to be among Monday's most actively traded issues: Intel, Microsoft, Priceline and Vodafone. Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC) Intel figures to see its typically high volume Monday after Friday's downgrade from Merrill Lynch. The chipmaker's shares fell 3 1/4 to 76 3/16 Friday after analyst Joseph Osha cut the stock from a "buy" recommendation to a near-term "accumulate" rating, citing increased competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NYSE: AMD) and the possibility of slower-than-expected adoption of its Itanium chip next year. "AMD was the straw that broke the camel's back," Osha told Reuters. "There have been problems, problems and more problems gathering that made it harder for me to defend the rating." He cut his price target on the stock to $90 from $100. He also trimmed the outlook for fiscal 2000 earnings per share to $2.55 from $2.69. With the arrival of AMD's Athlon chip, Intel will now have competition for its Pentium III at the high-end of the consumer and corporate PC sector. Up until now, AMD's Intel-compatible chips have targeted the low-cost PC market. Intel shares hit a 52-week high of 89 1/2 in September. Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) Microsoft shares will be moving as usual Monday, especially after Bill Gates was quoted as saying he insisted on the right to determine what goes into the company's widely used Windows operating system. Gates was interviewed by Time news magazine after a federal judge ruled last week Microsoft was a monopoly that had bullied rivals and hurt consumers by stifling competition, a ruling that analysts said could have drastic consequences including a possible break-up of the company. "We'd love to resolve this thing, and we're going to be pragmatic about it," Gates told Time when asked if he was ready to settle. But Gates said he could not agree to a settlement that restricted what new applications could be added to Windows. "Let's face it. Without innovation, given the intense competition out there, Windows would become irrelevant. Not only would that be a tragedy for the shareholders, it would be a tragedy for consumers.'' But Gates refused to be drawn into discussing details of a possible settlement. "The only thing that we know for sure that would be ad for consumers is anything that blocked us from being able to innovate Windows or anything that made is so that when people buy Windows they don't know what is in it. "Beyond those two principles, we'll be as pragmatic as we can," Gates said. Its shares closed off 7/16 to 89 3/16 Friday. Priceline.com Inc. (Nasdaq: PCLN) Ford Motor Co. will announce plans to let visitors to its Web site negotiate prices for new cars using Priceline.com's online bidding system, in the first deal of its kind between the Internet company and a car manufacturer, the Wall Street Journal said Monday. Ford will direct Internet users who look up prices for new Ford automobiles on its Web site to Priceline, where they can bid on the vehicles. Ford will pay Priceline an undisclosed amount to conduct the test, Priceline said.  Vodafone Airtouch Plc. (NYSE: VOD) Vodafone made a hostile takeover bid for German telecommunications and engineering company Mannesmann AG. So far, it's been unsuccessful. Sources close to the company said the all-stock bid was valued at more than $100 billion. Mannesmann AG said on Sunday it had rejected the unsolicited offer, saying it had turned down a Vodafone share exchange offer in which Vodafone proposed swapping 43.7 of its shares for a single Mannesmann share. It described the proposed deal as "financially extremely unattractive." Vodafone shares closed off 4 and change Friday to 47 3/8.>;

Title:
2002-01-02 - TurboLinux unveils system for Intel's Itanium chip

Article:
TurboLinux has become the first company to release a test version of the increasingly popular Linux operating system for Intel's delayed Itanium chip. The version, at this point a very raw collection of the Linux kernel along with bundled software and a less inconvenient installation, is significant for companies who want to move their software to Linux and Intel's future flagship chip design. Although TurboLinux was the first, it likely won't be alone for long. The other major Linux sellers--Red Hat, SuSE and Caldera Systems--are expected to come out with their own versions soon. Even Microsoft is paying attention; it was one of the companies that downloaded the TurboLinux OS, said Lonn Johnston, TurboLinux vice president of corporate communications. Linux, barely known in the computing industry two years ago, has emerged as one of the three premier operating systems that Intel is backing for the launch of the Itanium chip. Intel has been among the most aggressive investors in Linux, taking equity stakes in several young Linux companies as a way to give the operating system the seal of approval of the dominant chipmaker. "It never hurts to get out there first," said Microdesign Resources analyst Keith Diefendorff, but the more significant software development for Itanium is the compilers. Compilers, which translate programs written by people into instructions a chip can understand, are vastly more important with the Itanium chip than with other designs. Linux, an operating system based on Unix and rapidly embraced by the computing industry, is a key part of Intel's push to establish its Itanium chip, the first in its "IA-64" family. The chips will allow computers to store huge databases entirely in memory and enable faster mathematical calculations. Intel hopes Itanium and the later members of the IA-64 family will carry it into high-end computers that currently use chips from IBM, Sun Microsystems, Compaq, SGI or Hewlett-Packard. The Itanium chip has been delayed several times and is widely viewed as a first-generation product that will be used to debug software rather than to run critical computer tasks. But even months before the first systems built on Itanium arrive, it's already a dominant part of the computing landscape, with all the biggest hardware companies backing it. Most have higher expectations for Itanium's successor, code-named McKinley, which will offer higher performance and will arrive in late 2001, when companies have had more time to remove bugs from IA-64 computers and software. The number of operating systems available on Itanium has dropped. Compaq canceled its program to bring Tru64 Unix to Itanium. SGI decided to use Linux for the new chip. And IBM, Sequent and the Santa Cruz Operation decided to merge their versions into a single package called Monterey-64. The maturity of the Itanium operating systems will have a powerful influence on how well the chip design is received and how fast the chips wrest market share from the competing designs of Sun Microsystems, Compaq, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and SGI. The three-person "Frontier Group" at TurboLinux has three Itanium machines, early prototypes from Intel. Though the computers tend to crash when pushed hard, the effort is going better than expected, said Uros Prestor and Robert Read. During a three-day period, the Frontier Group prepared 350 different software packages in five days in an effort to get the alpha version of TurboLinux for IA-64 out. But using new-fangled, crash-prone hardware under such intense conditions is a mixed blessing, Prestor said. "It's always exciting being on the cutting edge. But during crunch time, we would take out the Nerf gun and shoot the machine," he said. For Linux, IA-64 offers a free ride into a more upscale neighborhood. Linux currently is most popular on less powerful 32-bit Intel chips, with versions for 64-bit chips such as Compaq's Alpha and Sun's UltraSparc far less common. IA-64 could be a way for Linux to become more popular in more powerful servers. "I think it's potentially very important," VA Linux Systems chief executive Larry Augustin said in an interview Wednesday. In particular, IA-64 Linux machines with large amounts of memory will be useful for serving up Web pages quickly, he said. The Trillian project to bring Linux to Itanium began at Hewlett-Packard more than two years ago and now involves numerous hardware companies. The Linux sellers themselves got involved in December. The Trillian project members released the core of Linux for IA-64 to the public in February and the first compiler two weeks later. A month ago, SGI--a hardware company moving its high-end servers and graphics machines to Linux--promised it would release its own compiler by the end of February. That compiler still hasn't shown up, though it's eagerly awaited, Prestor said. The current IA-64 compiler, GCC from Red Hat's Cygnus team, works very well when compiling software for lots of different chips, but it doesn't produce particularly fast software, said Prestor. SGI's compiler is expected to produce software tuned to run much faster. HP and Intel each have their own compilers for IA-64 as well. Diefendorff expects HP's will offer the highest performance. "If anybody is ahead on this, it is probably HP," he said. HP invented the IA-64 architecture and joined with Intel to make sure the design wouldn't be relegated to a small market. Though ostensibly an open-source project in which anyone can see and modify the original programming instructions, most Trillian work happens with the original teams, said Eric Sindelar, business development manager at VA and leader of VA's Trillian team. "All these hardware issues are still under NDA (non-disclosure agreement)," he said. "In early-level systems and software, you can't detach the operating system debugging from the hardware debugging." Diefendorff expects Itanium chips to arrive in late fall. Intel has said the chips will first run at speeds of 800 MHz. "I don't think the performance of this first generation is going to create a demand pull. It will mostly be an Intel and HP push," he said. But Intel's marketing and pricing efforts, combined with the longer-term potential of IA-64 and the existing support from computer makers, will mean success. "For the large-volume server market, it looks like IA-64 is unstoppable at this point," he said.;

2002-01-02 - The week in review Linux stocks rocket

Article:
The Internet mania which grips Wall Street seemed merely a prelude to the frenzy surrounding two Linux stocks that began trading this past week. VA Linux Systems, a company which sells computers based on the upstart operating system along with technical support and consulting services, set an all-time record for the biggest gain in the first day of trading. The company's IPO price was $30 per share, but the stock closed its first day of trading at 239.25--a phenomenal increase of 698 percent.Linux mania The jaw-breaking pop came one day after another Linux IPO, the debut of programmer information site Andover.Net, surged 250 percent. What is Wall Street thinking? Linux is comparatively little-used in the computing industry, except in server computers, where most think the so-called open-source software performs well. But the operating system's future growth could get a huge boost if it's deployed in conjunction with forthcoming 64-bit chips from Intel, which the giant hopes will power a new generation of even bigger servers. VA Linux is one of several companies involved in an effort to prepare Linux for the first of the new Intel chips, called Itanium, but the effort is about to gain steam with the addition of Linux sellers Red Hat, Caldera Systems, SuSE and Turbolinux, the companies that actually will sell the new version of Linux. Meanwhile, tensions over control of the Java programming came to a head. Creator Sun Microsystems backed out of a highly publicized effort to turn Java into an industry standard, which would have meant ceding some control to other companies. At the same time, IBM, Sun's biggest disciple in preaching the Java gospel, refused to support Sun's latest edition of the software, a version called Java 2 Enterprise Edition that's designed for use in servers.On the horizon Ericsson and Microsoft announced a joint venture to develop products that provide fast access to the Internet from any device. Ericsson will provide Microsoft with its Wireless Application Protocol format--which allows Net content to appear in the window of cellular devices--while adopting Microsoft's new Mobile Explorer package for Internet phones. The move is consistent with Microsoft's overall effort to expand as the high-tech industry turns from the personal computer to a variety of Net-based devices for communications. But the Redmond, Wash.-based software behemoth hasn't been the most successful in creating and sustaining alliances. Many companies have been jockeying furiously as the once-separate markets--software, telecommunications, handheld devices and e-commerce--continue to converge at a breakneck pace. With the first round of alliances and relationships to create products seemingly completed, the landscape looks remarkably familiar: Palm Computing and its allies vs. Microsoft and its camp.Another front Separately, in a speech highlighting the growing importance of streaming technologies, Microsoft chief executive Bill Gates said the company is investing significant resources into making it easier to see video and hear audio via the Internet. Some 45 companies backed Windows Media Player as their streaming media software of choice--including Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments and General Instrument--and joined Microsoft's Windows Media Broadband Jumpstart Initiative, a coalition of companies that support the software. At the same industry trade show, RealNetworks chief executive Rob Glaser reiterated his company's commitment to a hybrid identity as both a technology and media firm, outlining what he described as a streaming media "ecosystem" that provides technology for programmers and consumers as well as content services and aggregation to connect them. Real's vision of itself as a content aggregator stands in stark contrast to Microsoft's, which said it would not focus on streaming media content aggregation. Industry observers are skeptical on that point; Microsoft's determination to overtake Real is more certain. One day after blocking AT&T customers from accessing its giant instant messaging network, America Online agreed to sit down with AT&T and ally Tribal Voice to seek ways to end the escalating battle over access to the online giant's user base. The two companies agreed to meet early next year after Tribal Voice introduced a workaround. AOL previously battled Microsoft to a standstill on the issue, leading the software giant to throw in the towel on interoperability last month. In the war on bulk junk email, some companies are beginning to claim partial victories, and users are surprisingly backing those claims. Yahoo's anti-spam measure, launched last week, has met with some success. Hotmail's implementation has been more disappointing, users said. The Recording Industry Association of America sued start-up Napster for violating federal and state laws through "contributory and vicarious copyright infringement," because it has created a forum that lets online users trade unauthorized music files directly from their PCs. The lawsuit is the latest front in what has become a quicksand-like terrain for the music industry, which has been aggressively fighting to maintain control over their copyrighted material. In the case of Napster, it could be an uphill battle: At least two federal laws protect content "providers" from being held responsible for illegal activity over their networks.Shifting sands SAP chose IBM as its database of choice for internal development of its R/3 business application software on key operating systems, distancing itself from long-time database partner Oracle. Friction has been building between Oracle and its enterprise resource planning software rivals. AT&T plans to give high-speed Net access customers a choice of Internet service providers, announcing a deal with leading dial-up company MindSpring Enterprises. But the agreement doesn't go into effect until AT&T's exclusive contract with subsidiary Excite@Home expires in 2002. The move comes at a time when AT&T is waiting for a ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Portland, Ore., as to whether it can be legally forced to open up its high-speed network to outside ISPs. The decision comes just as Excite@Home had laid to rest some questions over its business strategy and future course. Two weeks ago, the company announced it would offer a tracking stock for its media assets, a move intended to quell rumors that the company might sell off Excite.com and other content properties. Separately, Excite@Home recently topped 1 million subscribers, meeting analysts' expectations and catapulting the company into a limited group of large, national ISPs. News Corp. formed a partnership worth more than $1 billion with Healtheon/WebMD. The financial terms include News Corp.'s providing $700 million in branding services over 10 years ($400 million domestically and $300 million internationally), a $100 million purchase of Healtheon/WebMD stock at $50 per share (making News Corp. a 10.8 percent minority stakeholder), a $100 million cash investment by News Corp. in an international joint venture; and a $62.5 million five-year licensing agreement for syndication of WebMD daily broadcast content. In a reversal of the usual trend to place traditional media content on Web sites, the media giant plans to distribute Healtheon/WebMD content across New Corp.'s television and print outlets.Think again Rambus named a new president and made other organizational changes as it prepares to launch into new markets, namely communications and other chip-to-chip applications. The company also disclosed a road map for existing chip technologies. Rambus' seemingly bright future darkened in September when Intel unexpectedly delayed a chipset that promotes next-generation Rambus memory, stunning many PC makers. Japanese consumers' preference for ever-thinner mobile computers and slimmer desktops that pack in moderate yet compelling features is influencing the design of products sold in the United States. PC makers including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq and Gateway are taking some cues from the world's second-largest market. Ted Waitt, the founder of Gateway, will step aside as chief executive on January 1 and hand over the reins to president Jeff Weitzen. Waitt did not say why he has decided to resign, but indicated that a transition has been underway for some time.Service, please Eleven major U.S. banks will join a consortium called Spectrum that operates an online bill-pay network. Formed in June by Chase Manhattan Bank, First Union and Wells Fargo, the network's new members include Comerica, Mellon Financial and Wachovia. Earlier this week, Sun Microsystems and Netscape announced plans to help Spectrum create an Internet billing system. About 63 billion bills are issued in the United States every year; companies that grab a significant share also can expect to sell other products and services because consumers tend to stick with their chosen financial institution. As e-commerce gains popularity, figuring out where to go for a redress of grievances can be just as frustrating as dealing with an uncooperative company. Problems ranging from missed shipping dates to outright scams ordinarily found offline now apply to the Internet. Additionally, even during this important holiday shopping season, many retail companies appear ill prepared for the perennial problem of handling customer phone calls. Calls made to online retailers' customer service centers can mean hold times of 10 minutes or longer--if you are able to get through at all, an informal survey by CNET News.com found. American television stations have joined the fight against Canadian Net TV company iCraveTV.com, demanding that the company stop showing their TV signals online or face legal action. ICraveTV, which launched early last week, streams the signals of 17 Canadian and U.S. TV stations online--uncut and uninterrupted. But the Web company didn't ask permission first, and now programmers on both sides of the border are trying to shut the young Net company down. The National Football League is also annoyed.Also of note IBM aims to build a $100 million supercomputer called Blue Gene that performs a quadrillion calculations per second--about a thousand times faster than the Deep Blue machine that beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov two years ago--to help researchers understand how proteins are created ...

Title:
2002-01-02 - Intel to detail new generations at conference

Article:
Following a year of product delays and increased competition, Intel plans to reassert itself in 2000 by introducing three microprocessor families meant to replace existing product lines. By fall, "Willamette" processors running at speeds greater than one GHz (gigahertz) and utilizing an enhanced data pathway will be seen in high-end desktop systems, while many lower-end PCs will contain the upcoming "Timna" processor, a derivative of the current Celeron that will contain integrated graphics capabilities. The first servers containing the Itanium chip, which will gradually replace Xeon, will also be out. Details of the new processors will be made available at the company's Developer Forum beginning Feb. 15 in Palm Springs, Calif. Along with a look at upcoming chip architectures, Intel will outline plans for expanding into the communications market and recruiting developers to write applications for the new processors, among other topics. Although Itanium will hit the market before Willamette and Timna, the latter two processors will probably garner more attention at the three-day conference. Far less is known about these two, so details will be finely scrutinized. Willamette will debut at speeds "well in excess of one GHz," said Pat Gelsinger, vice president and general manager of Intel's desktop products group. The chip is based on a different architecture than the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company's Pentium III, although both will run substantially the same software and share a large number of baseline characteristics, he said. People familiar with the chip have said it will incorporate a vastly improved "system bus," the processor's main conduit for data and a crucial element in performance. The bus will run at 200 MHz, these people said, faster than the 133-MHz bus on Pentium IIIs and equal to the bus on Advanced Micro Devices' high-end Athlon. In addition, the Willamette bus will be expanded from 64-bits wide to 128-bits wide. This means that more data will move to the processor at a faster rate, explained Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64, who noted, "They (Intel) haven't changed the bus width since 1993." Manufacturers will be able to match Willamette with high-speed Rambus-style memory, or the increasingly popular Double Data Rate memory. Willamette is due in the second half, with sources pinning it in the third quarter. Its sales could hit the ground running, analysts say. By contrast, Itanium sales are expected to get off to a slower start, according to a wide variety of industry observers. The 64-bit chip, Intel's first entry into a high-end market largely defined by such companies as Sun Microsystems and IBM, represents almost a complete break in design compared to its earlier processors. (The 64-bit designation refers to how the processor handles data, and is independent of a 64-bit bus.) Many think Intel's 64-bit chips may not sell in large numbers until the follow-up "McKinley" processor arrives in late 2001. While bullish on Itanium's marketplace acceptance, Gelsinger said the transition from Xeon, Intel's current and more conventional server chip, will be gradual. "Itanium will coexist with Xeon for a long time," he said. On the other hand, Willamette is likely to displace the Pentium III. "By the end of 2001, Pentium III is likely to be off the map," Brookwood said. The shift won't be as quick as the fairly easy leap from Pentium II to Pentium III, but shouldn't cause much of a fuss. "This is more like the transition from Pentium to Pentium Pro or Pentium II," Brookwood said. Intel also seems to have fairly high ambitions for a quick transition to Timna from Celeron. "This will become the primary product (in the "value PC" segment) by the end of the year," Andy Bryant, Intel's CFO, said at yesterday's Banc of America technology conference. "Originally it was designed as a way to reduce cost, but what we're learning is that you get performance with it. In a nutshell, Timna will be a version of Celeron integrated with a graphics chip and a memory controller, two components that typically exist on different pieces of silicon. "This is where you are going to see the promise of segmentation take place," he added, referring to the industry term for designing chip performance and price to appeal different markets. Timna will come out at 600 MHz and faster speeds when it debuts in the second half. Along with the processor efforts, Intel will encourage developers to write applications for all these architectures, said Dan Russell, general manager of the Intel architecture content services group. In particular, the company will work with e-commerce developers to create applications to run on Intel-based servers.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Tech titans tout new Java tools

Article:
Oracle, Sun Microsystems, BEA Systems and others will add a boost of caffeine to their Java menus this week. Software makers are courting the Java faithful at the JavaOne trade show with new products that allow software developers to use the Java programming language to build their business software. For years, the software companies have hitched their future to Java to combat rival Microsoft. They're all gunning for a piece of the lucrative market for e-business software that enables companies to share data and conduct trades online. They're also racing to offer the technology that businesses need to build Web-based software and services. The software makers this week will announce new Java products to improve and fill holes in their product portfolio, said Gartner analyst Mark Driver. "Everyone is coming out to push out their latest and greatest." Oracle on Monday announced it has jazzed up its application server with improved Java support to better compete against market-share leaders BEA and IBM, which have captured 35 percent and 30 percent of the $1.6 billion market, respectively. Application-server software allows businesses to handle e-commerce and other Web site transactions. Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison recently blamed his company's poor showing in the application-server market on its poor support of Java. Oracle executives now say the company's product is finally up to snuff. Oracle has rebuilt its application server to make Java software run faster than it previously could, said John Magee, senior director of Oracle 9i marketing. "Oracle has not been known for its core Java support. Now we have made major enhancements to make (the server) faster and smaller." The database-software giant, like its rivals, is supporting the new version of a Java-based standard for writing business software. The standard, called Java 2 Enterprise Edition, is a uniform way for companies to build business software using the Java language. At its core is the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) programming model, which lets developers create reusable pieces of software code and is a direct competitor to Microsoft's programming model. Not to be outdone, BEA on Monday is releasing several new products, including a version of its application server that supports new Web standards that allow people to build Web-based software and services. Oracle's new application server supports the new Web standards as well. All the software companies have been racing to develop and sell software for building and delivering Web services, which let people access software through the Web instead of from individual PCs. To fill gaps in its e-business product family, BEA also announced a new integration server, software that allows businesses to link their different computing systems so they can exchange data and conduct business over the Web. The company also announced new portal software, which allows businesses to create Web portal sites for their employees, partners and suppliers. IBM, which last week announced similar application-server features to be released later this summer, said that its WebSphere application server will support a new Java standard that will make it simpler for telecommunications service providers to offer new, fancy features to telephone subscribers. Hewlett-Packard will announce a small, lightweight version of its application server, so software developers who are writing business software can integrate an application server into their product. Sun executives say the company will release a high-end Java software development tool to better compete against WebGain, Borland and IBM, which have traditionally led the market in Java tools for writing software. Sun's Forte for Java Enterprise Edition supports EJBs and includes features that allow members of a software-development team to work closely together on the same project. Sun needed to release the high-end tool to help augment sales of its iPlanet family of application servers and other e-business software, analysts say. "Their previous Forte for Java tools were entry level at best. It was a hobbyist tool and not used by the bulk of commercial developers," said Gartner's Driver. iPlanet, an alliance between Sun and America Online, on Monday is releasing new messaging software that allows business messages to be sent back and forth from company to company. Borland is announcing that software giant SAP has chosen its product for developing Java. Borland also recently announced that it has built a new Java development tool for Nokia, allowing software programmers to write Java software for Nokia phones. Borland executives said they plan to offer Java tools for other cell phone manufacturers in the future. WebGain, formerly Symantec's Java tools division, also announced new versions of its tools, which include features such as the ability to test and debug software. Even Intel is getting into the act, ponying up cash to be a gold sponsor of the software show, despite its hardware rivalry with Sun. Intel will tout its Developer Services for Java, a program to help companies fine-tune and promote their Java software running on Intel-based computers. The Intel program also makes it easier for programmers to get access to computers that use Intel's new Itanium server chip. IBM is providing Java programming tools for Itanium, Intel said. Also on the hardware front, IBM will announce that it has beaten Sun and Hewlett-Packard in releasing Java for use on 64-bit servers--a development that allows the use of much more memory than that available with 32-bit Java. The new IBM Java Developer Kit, version 1.3.0, works on IBM's Unix servers. Big Blue, which is Java's biggest supporter after Sun, also will boast that its servers outpace Sun's own on Java speed measurements. News.com's Stephen Shankland contributed to this report.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Intel halts sales of defective server chip

Article:
Intel has stopped shipping its top-end server chip because of a bug that could cause servers to crash. Intel began shipping the chip, the Pentium III Xeon with 2MB of high-speed "cache" memory, in March. But about a month later, a company that sells computers using the chip notified Intel that it found a problem while testing the chip, Intel spokesman Bill Kircos said Tuesday. Intel was able to reproduce the problem but unable to patch existing systems, Kircos said. Accordingly, the company stopped shipping the chip in mid-April. Intel is changing the chip's manufacturing process, and a new version of the processor is expected to begin shipping in mid-August, Kircos said. Until then, Intel will swap out the defective chip with the slower 700MHz version. The problem is comparatively minor because few customers had the chip at this early stage in its life, Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood said. "It's very contained. I doubt any end-users have experiences or are likely to experience this problem," Brookwood said. In addition, the customers buying the chip are comparatively rare and often are satisfied with a 700MHz chip. Though Intel characterized the problem as minor, the company doubtless would prefer to sell the 900MHz model, which sells for $3,692 in quantities of 1,000, compared with $1,980 for the 700MHz chip. It's not easy designing high-end chips, which typically feature more circuitry and run under higher stress than the CPUs of desktop computers. Sun Microsystems found a problem in its new top-end UltraSparc III chip that forced the company to disable a speed-boosting feature, even though the problem only was found in lab testing. But companies have to be conservative when dealing with demanding server customers, the people in charge of the computers that handle critical business operations such as tracking inventory or booking plane reservations. The Pentium III Xeon is one of a host of high-end server chips Intel is selling as a way to take on Sun and other more established server companies. The 900MHz Pentium III Xeon with 2MB of cache is the current top-end product for multiprocessor servers. Eventually replacing it will be a server version of the Pentium 4 chip, code-named Foster and sold since May under the name Xeon with no "Pentium" prefix. But the 2MB cache feature, which increases the size, speed and price of the chip, isn't yet available on the Xeon. That model is expected in the first quarter of 2002, Kircos said. Also coming in 2002 is a version of the Xeon chip built with smaller, faster 0.13-micron circuitry, Kircos said. This chip is code-named Prestonia, Brookwood said. But for the long term, Intel is banking heavily on a totally different design called Itanium. This chip, which began shipping in servers in June, speaks a totally different language than the Pentium and Xeon lines. Because it's such a dramatic departure and requires big changes to software, it is largely used as a development system at present. Intel had hoped to be able to screen for the problem so it could continue to sell 900MHz chips that didn't show the defect, Kircos said, but that plan didn't work out. "The workaround we hoped would keep them shipping was a screen," he said. "We didn't feel the screen met our quality standards. We decided to go with a manufacturing tweak." Intel's problem occurs in rare circumstances in "extreme" testing and hasn't been reported by any system users, Kircos said. When the problem occurs, the chip fails to write information to a part of the processor that keeps track of what tasks are going on, locking the chip into an endless loop of pointless processing.;

2002-01-02 - Intel pushes back schedule for Itanium chip

Article:
Intel's Itanium schedule slipped a notch today, as the company said the need for another revision to the chip will mean it can't begin selling its future flagship product as soon as expected. Intel said it won't start receiving revenue from the Itanium chip, the company's first 64-bit processor, until the fourth quarter of this year. The company earlier expected revenue to begin in the third quarter. In addition, the only computers using the chip to ship this year will be "pilot systems," and the general availability will encroach even further on Itanium's successor, code-named McKinley and due to arrive in the second half of 2001. Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel architecture group, said testing and other tasks to ensure that the new architecture was bulletproof prompted Intel to delay the product. "The overall task of validating and fixing everything...pushed us to look at it one quarter further out than we thought," Otellini said. "This is a different environment for us." Consequently, general availability for Itanium won't begin until the first half of next year. "We expect our customers to offer general availability of hardware, software (and other Itanium products) over the first half of 2001," Otellini said. Added spokesman Bill Kircos: "The change of recognition of revenue is a result of requiring an additional processor revision prior to moving to the pilot release." The news is a vindication for skeptics who doubted Intel's ambitious and already delayed schedule. The Itanium chip and its successors in the IA-64 family are geared to muscle into the market for servers based on elaborate, high-priced chip designs from Sun Microsystems, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer and SGI. "I think there are still some delays in getting the chip really ready to go and getting the (computer manufacturers) ready to run with it," said Linley Group analyst Linley Gwennap. "This is what I expected a year ago. It was going to take longer than they thought." Itanium, which was known for years by its code name, Merced, is expected to debut at speeds of 733 MHz and 800 MHz, Kircos said. The schedule hasn't changed for McKinley, Kircos said. McKinley also will debut in "pilot systems" near the end of 2001. In early 2001, early samples of the chip will be sent to manufacturers, Kircos said. Analysts and even some computer makers have been warning that Itanium systems would largely be used to debug the new hardware design and accompanying software. However, they have generally agreed that the IA-64 family would prevail in the long term as a number of new design features provide for more muscular Intel server designs. Hewlett-Packard, which invented the design underlying the IA-64 family but expected it to come to market much earlier, has described a modest pace of adoption for the new chip. Manufacturers, in fact, have been economizing on their development funds for Itanium for a while. Intel, for example, will actually manufacture Itanium servers for some computer makers and will sell motherboards to all of them, the company said. This cuts down on independent design costs. "For two- and four-ways, we've got a popular motherboard configuration," Kircos said. Bucking the trend, Intel server stalwart Compaq is building its own four-chip Itanium server. Intel is also not designing its own chipset for eight-processor Itanium servers, said a company spokesman. The company will make eight-way chipsets for Foster, a version of the Pentium 4 for servers coming in the first quarter of next year, and McKinley, the successor to Itanium. The revision to the Itanium will take the form of a new "stepping," a modification to the chip design, Kircos said. The chip currently is in its "b" series of steppings, a source familiar with the chip said. Currently there are about 15,000 Itaniums in 5,000 systems in the hands of software and hardware designers, he said. Unlike the fanfare that's surrounded the debuts of Pentium chips, Intel doesn't plan doesn't plan a big to-do for Itanium, Kircos said. "We'll have a series of milestones. There won't be one processor launch per se," he said.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Compaq Life after Alpha

Article:
Compaq Computer's announcement on Monday to license its Alpha chip technology to Intel signals the end of the line for the chip--once hailed as the fastest on the planet. Intel will begin channeling some Alpha technology and engineering talent toward its recently introduced line of Itanium processors, and Compaq will turn exclusively to the Intel chip to power its servers--paring down expenses, consolidating its product lines, and beginning a shift to software and services. The Alpha will be no more by 2004. Originally designed by Digital Equipment, the Alpha was for years considered an example of state-of-the-art technology that few people wanted to buy. The first Alpha chip shipped in 1992, running at a record-breaking 200MHz. The 64-bit chip was engineered to run multiple operating systems--Unix in addition to Microsoft's Windows NT--and was expected to have a life span of 25 years, according to historical information on Compaq's Web site. Alpha was also the first mass-produced chip to reach a clock speed of 1GHz, back in 1999. The chip--and servers based on it--won a dedicated core of customers, but it was expensive, and finding software applications to run on the Alpha was a constant struggle for its users. Because of low sales of Alpha systems, Microsoft stopped shipping a version of Windows NT for the chip architecture in 1999. Compaq acquired the chip as part of its purchase of Digital in 1998. After that, the technology's death was often predicted, as more-popular chip architectures gradually caught up to, and finally surpassed, the Alpha's performance level. Given the history of the chip, the decision to discontinue it wasn't easy, said Compaq executives. But it was necessary for the company's bottom line. And aside from the cost of maintaining the chip--at least several hundred million dollars per year--Compaq executives said the chip was running out of steam. "I think there was a growing feeling--not just inside Compaq--that a lot of these RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architectures (such as the Alpha) were running out of runway," said Mike Winkler, Compaq's executive vice president of global business units. "As we continued to work with Intel...there was a kind of mutual epiphany that said (the Itanium's) price-performance...is really reaching the point where it eclipses the RISC architecture we're using today." "As you get to next-generation processors with smaller and smaller die sizes," Winkler said, referring to new manufacturing processes, "it becomes more and more expensive exponentially to continue to invest in this architecture over time." "It was a very pragmatic business decision, and it was very much about price-performance, commonality...scalability...and every customer we've talked to so far has been positive," said Winkler. Compaq's decision came to a head after the results of an exhaustive study conducted by the company were made available to Compaq brass, according to analyst and company follower Terry Shannon. "Within four years or less, Compaq no longer would be able to maintain performance differentiation on the Alpha chip," Shannon wrote in the latest edition of his newsletter "Shannon Knows Compaq." "In light of cost-reduction efforts now underway throughout Compaq, the substantial investment required to develop and deploy future Alpha processor designs became extremely difficult to justify," wrote Shannon. "Hence, the researchers carefully examined a number of 'Life After Alpha' business scenarios." Translation: Alpha, the chip once hailed as the most advanced on the planet, is now an also-ran. Compaq realized "the then current Alpha chip--its EV8--would not have a significant performance advantage" over Itanium, Shannon said. So the company began the long process by which it will phase out the chip. While it populates its product lines with Itanium processors, Compaq will finish development work on two future versions of the Alpha chip, including its chips code-named EV68 and EV7, which will offer 1GHz and faster speeds. The Alpha EV68 will be available this summer in Compaq's AlphaServer GS, at speeds of 1GHz, the company said. Meanwhile, the EV7 is planned to ship later this year at speeds of 1.2GHz and later 1.6GHz, Shannon said. Compaq said it will use the EV7 in an AlphaServer model planned for next year. While analysts such as Shannon lamented the loss of the once mighty chip, they say that Compaq did help to ease the process: The company notified customers ahead of time, essentially giving them three years before the Alpha is phased out and Itanium becomes the chip of choice. "All in all, customers should have nothing to fear," Shannon said. "As a longtime Alpha advocate, I'm saddened Alpha is going away." However, "I know some of the very large customers I have talked to are happy." Shannon expects "there will be a lot of Alpha technology incorporated into (Intel's Itanium) designs." He speculates that Alpha's "glueless SMP" and EV8's SMT, or simultaneous multi-threading technologies, would make their way into future Itanium chips. Intel's involvement with Alpha goes back to the settlement of a patent lawsuit between Intel and Digital in 1998. As part of the settlement, Intel purchased Digital's StrongARM processor, along with the Hudson, Mass., manufacturing plant where the StrongARM--and the Alpha--were produced. At the same time, Samsung, IBM and Advanced Micro Devices were granted licenses for the Alpha. IBM now manufactures some Alpha processors for Compaq, while Samsung produces the rest. A marketing organization--dubbed Alpha Processor Inc.--was formed. The company is now known as Alpha Networks and is diversifying its horizons in working with other chipmakers, such as AMD.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - Commentary Oracle faces challenges with 9i

Article:
Despite adding ambitious capabilities to 9i, Oracle still faces challenges with its first new version of its database software in two years. 9i provides new functions in areas such as OLTP and decision support and brings Oracle even with DB2 and SQL Server in OLAP performance. However, adding capabilities such as cube building in the DBMS and Real Application Clusters (RAC) are keys to this new release--and the most significant technical challenge. If this extension of Oracle Parallel See news story: Oracle takes on foes with new price plan Server works, it will be a significant advancement, providing the capability to expand a database with new logical nodes in a shared environment on any platform that Oracle supports. Logical clustering is difficult in an OLTP environment, and Oracle is the only vendor to even attempt it on a platform it does not totally control. However, that "if" is significant, given the short beta period Oracle gave 9i to meet Larry Ellison's promise to deliver the new database version in the first half of this year. We recommend that users wait 10 to 12 months before moving production databases to 9i, just as we would for any major DBMS migration. But Oracle should get some credit for attempting this feat. In effect, it is demonstrating its leadership of the database industry just by making the attempt. However, we do not expect RAC to work immediately without a hiccup in production systems. We expect that Oracle will need to bring out intermediate upgrades, and that it may not work outside specialized applications on any platform until clustered file systems are available for the four major platforms. This should be available from Veritas around the same time as the next scheduled major upgrade of 9i, which is due in March 2002. A key question is when Microsoft will come out with a cluster file system. Oracle wants to include cluster file system functionality in RAC so that it will work on any platform, but we believe it will take a significant amount of time to achieve that. Combining this with the introduction of Intel's new 64-bit Itanium processor family creates the possibility of commodity Unix systems. Hewlett-Packard and IBM have promised to port HP-UX and AIX to Itanium. But, significantly, Sun has no plans to move the SPARC environment. If Oracle does succeed with RAC, it will be a major breakthrough in database capabilities. Although Oracle talks about it mainly as an advance for OLTP, we see its most valuable use in high-availability situations requiring a master/slave environment. We also expect early adoption for analytical applications, which currently are some of few applications that use two nodes under Oracle Parallel Server. But it does not deliver the performance that IBM's and NCR's shared-nothing architectures deliver. We believe Oracle has a good chance of making RAC work. From an architectural standpoint, it looks sound, and when it does work it will be a huge leap. For example, users that currently have a high-availability application on an eight-way system typically have a second eight-way system standing by in slave mode. If these users want to move to a 16-way system, with RAC they will no longer need a second 16-way just to stand by in slave mode. Users should not plan to move production databases to 9i for at least six to eight months, giving Oracle a chance to iron out the inevitable wrinkles associated with a release this significant. Risk-weary users should wait until the second major version appears in March 2002. Those with advanced needs demanding leading-edge technology (such as high-availability master/slave databases) should use the intervening period for testing. In general, however, we expect 9i to have significant issues. Sixty days is too short for a general beta test of major enterprise software, particularly because it would take the testers several weeks just to get their hands on it and get around to installing it. Users should regard the next 10 months as the real 9i beta test. META Group analysts Mark Shainman, Charles Garry, Val Sribar, Dale Kutnick, and David Cearley contributed to this article.

Title:
2002-01-02 - Itanium to largely skip telecom market

Article:
Itanium-based servers for the telecommunications market will be largely symbolic until the arrival of the chip's successor. Despite multiple delays and the stringent requirements of much of its target market, Intel still says its Itanium processor launch this year will be one of the biggest introductions of its kind. But a senior executive admitted that telecommunications companies and other businesses won't be tempted to switch their existing 64-bit systems over to IA-64 until next year. The chip giant is in the midst of launching the first IA-64 chip, Itanium, for workstations and servers--and now for telecommunications servers. But Gordon Graylisch, Intel's director of e-business and communications solutions, admitted on Friday that for telecom users, Itanium will mainly be used as a development technology for IA-64 while companies wait for Itanium's successor, McKinley, next year. "With McKinley people will start taking existing environments and moving them over," said Graylisch. He said Itanium will mainly be bought by companies that happen to be in the market for new servers and workstations and are interested in the new technology. "But I don't see that as particularly limiting for Itanium," he said. Intel is entering unfamiliar territory with its move into servers for the telecommunications industry. Such servers face far more strict reliability requirements, which will make it even more difficult for Intel to sell the brand-new and untested Itanium processor. The market is now dominated by the likes of Sun Microsystems, which is also a major player in the high-end servers Intel originally designed IA-64 to run. Intel's main selling point is the notion that IA-64 will be one of the few platforms that will be running high-end servers and that it could eventually also become the standard for lower-end servers, desktop PCs, and even mobile and embedded devices. Because of Intel's massive manufacturing base, Itanium is also far less expensive than its competitors. Graylisch said Itanium's release will be "small by PC standards," but it will be "one of the strongest introductions from anybody." Industry analysts believe that Itanium's multiple delays have partly damaged its attractiveness by giving it a short shelf life before it is replaced. "The first version will get a very respectable rollout, and people will be deploying around that," Graylisch said. "McKinley makes it an absolute no-brainer." Staff writer Matthew Broersma reported from London.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - New Pentium 4 to turn up heat on PC prices

Article:
Intel on Monday released a 1.7GHz Pentium 4 processor--and with it, a scorched-earth approach to the PC market. As earlier reported, the new chip, which will be featured in a number of PCs from major manufacturers, will increase overall desktop performance, especially on entertainment applications such as video encoding, according to company executives. Equally important, Intel will slash the price of the Pentium 4 line and pour millions into advertising and software-developer programs to ensure the chip penetrates nearly every segment of the sleepy PC market. The 1.7GHz Pentium 4 will sell for $352 when it debuts, with PCs incorporating the chip selling for just less than $1,800, monitor included. Price cuts on 1.3GHz, 1.4GHz and 1.5GHz Pentium 4 chips slated for the following week will drop the base price of computers using the chip to the $1,000 mark. A little more than a year ago, 1GHz chips alone cost $1,299. "In corporations, (buying Pentium 4 computers) becomes a no-brainer. The price moves are incredibly aggressive," said Van Baker, a vice president at Gartner. "For consumers, for the kind of applications Intel is talking about--video streaming, audio--it offers significantly better performance." More applications also will begin to emerge that are optimized for the chip, said Anand Chandrasekher, vice president of microprocessor marketing at Intel. The company will spend roughly $500 million on promoting its technology with software developers, with most of the activity geared toward the Pentium 4 or Itanium, its new server chip. Another $300 million will go into advertising. "Up until now, it has been consumers, but we are going to start to ramp into the corporate environment," Chandrasekher said. "The new architecture enables a significant threshold of performance." Rival Advanced Micro Devices next week will provide its first public demonstration of dual-processor Athlon workstations at the National Association of Broadcasters show in Las Vegas. Dual-processor Athlon machines will come out later in the quarter, sources said. The price cuts don't come without pain, however. The chip still costs far more to produce than the Pentium III, according to many analysts, although Chandrasekher said manufacturing costs are declining. AMD, which increased market share by four percentage points last quarter, will also likely feel a price pinch. CEO Jerry Sanders has said that the company will match Intel pricing for chips rated at the same speed. The 1.3GHz Athlon sells for $318, which means AMD will have to chop the price 39 percent to keep pace with Intel. The price issue will also likely not abate. Although AMD has been able to equal and even best Intel when it comes to chip design, Intel far outstrips AMD when it comes to factory capacity. The price of a cheaper chip By the end of the year, Intel will be producing Pentium 4s in seven plants, Chandrasekher said. AMD has two plants. Often in the past, the production imbalance has allowed Intel to undercut AMD in volume and price. Intel, for instance, will move to the more economical 0.13-micron manufacturing process with the Pentium 4 in the fourth quarter, a quarter ahead of AMD, and also move more quickly to use larger 300-millimeter silicon wafers, which will cut manufacturing costs by around 30 percent. "Intel will be the lowest-cost producer, enhancing its gross margins and giving the company an edge in any price war," wrote Ashok Kumar, an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. The megahertz gap between the two companies will also grow. Right now, AMD's fastest Athlon tops out at 1.3GHz. By the third quarter, it goes to 1.5GHz. By then, the Pentium 4 will be hitting 2GHz, according to sources. "AMD is forced into a frequency matchup with Intel, which is beneficial to Intel," said Kevin Krewell, senior analyst with Microdesign Resources. Then again, the Pentium 4 to date hasn't sold as well as anticipated, according to, among others, Dan Niles of Lehman Brothers. AMD's share of the PC processor market rose from 17 percent in the fourth quarter of 2000 to 21 percent in the first quarter of 2001, according to preliminary numbers released by Mercury Research. Corporate buyers are also losing their Intel-only mentality. Athlon "has proven itself over the past two gears," said a manager of desktop support and strategy at a large Northeast manufacturing company, who asked not to be identified. "At this point, I'm looking at it as a possibility. I'm doing some benchmarks. A year ago, I don't know that I would have considered it." "I won't jump to Pentium 4 until the (PC) manufacturers make it attractive to me" with lower prices, he added. Staff writer John Spooner contributed to this report.;

2002-01-02 - BEA partners with Intel on e-biz software

Article:
BEA Systems on Monday announced a partnership with Intel in a bid to increase its lead in the market for e-business software. The two companies will jointly fine-tune BEA's e-business software to run on servers that use Intel's new Itanium processor. The effort will focus on optimizing BEA software for both Linux and Windows on Itanium, an Intel representative said. Analysts say the collaboration is important for both companies. For BEA, having Intel support, market and sell its products gives the company a leg up on its competition in the lucrative market for application-server software, technology that handles e-business and other Web site transactions. In the $2.2 billion market in 2000, BEA ranked first with 18 percent of the market, followed by IBM with 15 percent and Sun Microsystems with 8 percent, according to a recent study by market researcher IDC. For Intel, the deal with BEA is a vote of confidence as it tries to crack the profitable high-end server market with its faster Itanium processors. Intel has done well in the less-profitable low-end server market, while rivals Sun, Hewlett-Packard and IBM have dominated the high-end market. Analysts say Intel's success in the high-end market depends on the number of software makers that write software that runs on its processors. BEA plans to release software that runs on Intel's Itanium chip this fall. So far, six server makers--Compaq Computer, Dell Computer, HP, NCR, Unisys and Groupe Bull--have said they will support BEA's application server running on Itanium. "This is the most important deal we've ever done," BEA Chief Executive Bill Coleman said in an interview. Although the Itanium-based server market is negligible now, "it could be the vast majority of the market in the next couple of years," Coleman added. Meta Group analyst Nick Gall said BEA's partnership with Intel is a smart move because it gives the company a new avenue for selling its software. BEA has sold a lot of its software running on Sun's servers, but Sun is also a BEA competitor in the application-server market. "Their good partnership is going to shift if Sun is serious about competing in the application-server market," Gall said. "Therefore, (BEA) has to look at other additional partners.";

2002-01-02 - AMD reports a loss but beats expectations

Article:
AMD, a company with grand plans but short-term difficulties, today soundly beat analysts' earnings expectations by 25 cents. The chipmaker and Intel rival reported a net loss of 72 cents per share for the third quarter. It was expected to lose 97 cents per share for the quarter, according to financial analysts surveyed by First Call. The loss is considerably greater than the 1-cent-per-share profit from the same quarter a year ago but not as severe as the $1.10 loss posted last quarter. In the most recent quarter, AMD had revenues of $662 million, down 3 percent from the $686 million from the like quarter a year before. The company's net loss was $106 million. The company attributed its stronger-than-expected results to strong sales of its high-end--and higher profit margin--Athlon processor, as well 28 percent growth in its flash memory products from the quarter. In order to break even in the current quarter, AMD will have to achieve revenues of about $850 million, the company said, a hope that isn't likely, even with an expected surge in holiday sales. "This is a very tough goal," said AMD chief executive Jerry Sanders in a conference call today. "In the face of uncertainty [from Taiwan earthquake effects], it remains just that--a goal." In the last quarter, AMD earned $295 million from PC processor sales, Sanders said. In addition, AMD said it would sell its communications and networking chip business, which has been profitable for many quarters. Sanders declined to state how much the company expected to receive for the division, but he said AMD would keep access to the division's intellectual property so it could be used in chips to power devices such as TV set-top boxes and cell phones. AMD, while suffering from production issues and fierce competition from Intel, has potential for a rosier future, analysts have said. Yesterday, AMD unveiled plans to take on Intel's upcoming 64-bit Itanium chip by extending the current "x86" chip architecture instead of following Intel's plan of starting afresh with new architecture. Though analysts are cautious about AMD's ability to pull off such a grand plan, several at this week's Microprocessor Forum noted that AMD could clean up if Intel's Itanium plan stumbles. The Itanium, formerly code-named Merced, is due in mid-2000 and is the first in Intel's family of high-end "IA-64" chips. AMD's current high-performance Athlon chip, which has beat out current Pentiums from Intel, could fill current demand, while its new "x86-64" chips in 2001 could step in if Itanium flops. The Athlon chip is key to AMD's recovery plan. The high-end chip comes with a healthier average selling price and profit margin than the low-end K6-2 and K6-III chips that the firm has been better known for in the past. The company built 350,000 Athlon chips and shipped 200,000 in the last quarter as well as about 4.3 million of the K6-2 and K6-III chips, Sanders said. The reason more of the Athlons didn't make it into products was limitation on the number of "motherboards," the circuit boards that house CPUs and other computer innards. Where the overall average selling price for AMD was $65, the Athlons sold for an average of just under $300, AMD said. Compaq and IBM sell Athlon-based computers, but Sanders said more PC makers should be announced in coming months. In the current quarter, AMD would have been able to ship as many as a million Athlons, but the company is constrained by the Taiwan earthquake's effects on motherboards and other components, Sanders said. While AMD is confident it could make a million Athlons this quarter, earthquake uncertainties mean that the company likely only will ship 800,000. That means AMD likely won't meet the projections of Merrill Lynch analyst Joe Osha and BancBoston Robertson Stephens analyst Dan Niles, both of whom had expected a million Athlons to ship in the current quarter. Part of the reason AMD beat expectations was through cutting costs. Capital investments for chip factories were delayed until 2000, AMD said. AMD showed prototypes of its Athlon chip running at 800 MHz this week that used new copper interconnect technology and built on a process that can etch details as small as 0.18 micron. "We're on track for 1 GHz by the end of next year," Sanders said. Athlons running at 750 MHz also will debut in the first quarter of 2000, he said. In fact, this will be the last month AMD makes Athlon chips on the 0.25 micron process, Sanders said. Revenue from those chips should start arriving in the second quarter of 2000, he said. Motorola deal Another change that could help AMD is a possible deal with Motorola in which AMD could use its new Dresden, Germany, chip factory to build Motorola G4 chips. That deal would follow one AMD announced more than a year ago under which Motorola builds AMD's Athlon chips, formerly called K7s. Using AMD facilities also would help out Motorola, which has been unable to meet Apple's demand for new G4 chips. Making Motorola chips makes sense: Through a technology-swapping deal, the two companies expect to have identical chipmaking technology. AMD plans to announce an arrangement to help cover many of the costs of the new Dresden facility, Sanders said. "We're highly confident that we'll have an arrangement that will enable to not have to absorb all the costs," he said, though he declined to state whether AMD would build another company's chips there or whether another company would take a stake in the plant. AMD will use part of the Dresden facility's capacity to build flash memory, Sanders said. Flash memory sales brought in $195 million in revenue in the last quarter, the company said.;

2002-01-02 - Reliance Computer renames deals with Intel

Article:
Reliance Computer has renamed itself ServerWorks and unveiled a key partnership with its biggest rival: Intel. The company, competing in a little-regarded but vitally important chip market, has signed a deal with the industry's hegemon in hopes of staying ahead of the curve. Like Intel and smaller companies such as Via Technologies and SiS, ServerWorks, based here, makes chipsets, the critical chips that connect central processing units (CPU) with everything else in computers--such as memory, network cards, hard disks and graphics cards. The move, intended to help the company keep up with Intel's current and future CPUs, provides ServerWorks with access to the technical specifications of the "bus," or data pathway, used to talk to the CPU. The agreement runs through 2008, according to executives. Though it would seem otherwise, it's not paradoxical for a company to be an Intel competitor and partner simultaneously. "Intel is willing to sign an agreement with anybody who will help them sell more microprocessors," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. Legal squabbles with Intel have hampered the chipset efforts of Via and SiS, but ServerWorks is confident it will be able to stay on the company's good side, said Kimball Brown, vice president of business development at ServerWorks. "We have a fabulous relationship with the CPU team," he said. The agreement coincides with a corporate name-change, which had been expected, and the unveiling of a new Web site. ServerWorks hopes to raise its profile in order to prepare for an initial public offering, planned for later this year, and to attract new customers, said chief executive Raju Vegesna. As the new name would suggest, ServerWorks seems most interested in high-end computing systems. In servers, Brown argues, the CPU is in charge, but the chipset often is the workhorse, transferring information among the network, the hard disk and memory. Chipsets may never have as high a profile as CPUs, Vegesna added, but the features will be in great demand. For instance, the next-generation ServerSet IV will enable the higher-speed PCI-X technology for plugging in network cards and other peripherals as well as "hot plug" methods of swapping out faulty memory or PCI cards without shutting a computer down, Vegesna said. Higher-speed double-data-rate memory also is planned. ServerWorks' current ServerSet III chipset is used in two-processor servers from Intel, Dell, IBM and Compaq, the largest manufacturers of Intel servers. But much of the 85-person company's attention is focused on the next generation of chips from Intel, code-named Foster and due later this year. Foster will provide a new core to replace the current Pentium design, which has been used for years. But more important for ServerWorks, it will provide a new and faster bus that will speed communications between the CPU and its surrounding hardware. Current Pentiums allow communication rates of 800 megabytes per second. The Foster bus will enable rates four times that, 3.2 gigabytes per second. Future chipsets from ServerWorks designed to work with Intel's "McKinley" chip, due in late 2001, will enable speeds of 5 gigabytes per second, Brown said. McKinley is the sequel to Itanium, Intel's first crack at a 64-bit processor. Brown said ServerWorks won't make a chipset for Itanium, which was code-named Merced. "We're not going to invest in Merced," he said. "We believe that it's a development platform." As previously reported, ServerWorks is targeting the server appliance market. A server appliance is configured in advance to do a specific job, making it faster, cheaper or easier to use than a general-purpose server. Brown said server appliances, while not as powerful as general-purpose systems, are usually good enough for a job. And some types of server appliances--specifically the ultra-thin ones bolted by the dozens to racks--will become more powerful when Intel starts shipping thinner "flip-chip" designs, Brown said. Those chips will enable two-processor systems 1.75 inches tall, half the thickness of current systems.;

2002-01-02 - AMD releasing details on 64-bit Sledgehammer

Article:
Some of the mystery surrounding Sledgehammer, the 64-bit processor coming from Advanced Micro Devices, will be lifted today when the company posts a technical manual geared at recruiting software developers to the project. The document, called the Architecture Programmers' Overview, explains the technical principles underlying Sledgehammer, the successor to the Athlon processor. Sledgehammer is slated to appear in samples by late 2001. Commercial shipments will likely start in 2002, according to AMD. "The higher-level architecture is done," said Bob Mitton, division marketing manager at AMD. "We want to start to roll it out and get everyone to look at it." Sledgehammer is one of the company's most ambitious projects to date. The chip will run software designed for 32-bit processors, such as Intel's Pentium III and AMD's Athlon, as well as software for 64-bit chips, a class of processors that includes Sun Microsystems' UltraSparc, Compaq Computer's Alpha and Intel's upcoming Itanium. The 32- and 64-bit designation refers to the amount of data that a processor can handle in a single instruction: The larger the number, the more data that can be processed at one time. With 64-bit chips, server makers also can incorporate much more memory in their machines. Itanium and Sledgehammer differ in the type of 64-bit programs they will run. For Itanium and its successors, Intel and Hewlett-Packard developed an entirely new instruction set, or processing protocols, for the chip. Software is being developed to recognize Itanium's instruction set. By contrast, Sledgehammer will use the same basic instruction set as the Athlon but will contain features that allow the chip to run 64-bit programs. As a result, software makers only need to retrofit their programs, not write completely new ones. "This is the conservative step approach. It is not a major disruption," Mitton said. "If it's not broke, why fix it?" Similarly, Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD will only need to concentrate on one chip family. The underlying core of Sledgehammer chips in desktops, notebooks and servers will essentially be identical, Mitton said. It will be up to computer manufacturers to decide whether to have a given processor run as a 32-bit or 64-bit chip when they assemble their machines. The core of Intel's 64- and 32-bit chips will be different for years. The question, of course, is whether the chip will prove to be effective in both types of machines. Making a chip ambidextrous almost always creates a performance hit. With Itanium and its successors, Intel is aiming to provide optimal performance with 64-bit chips. These processors will run standard 32-bit applications, but with no performance enhancements. The big issue for Sledgehammer is how well it will run 64-bit applications. The chip will likely perform fine in desktops, but adoption by server companies may be slow if Sledgehammer can't approximate Itanium's performance. "With compatibility, the positive is that you are bringing everyone along. The negative is that you are carrying baggage," said Mike Feibus, principal analyst at Mercury Research. AMD also faces the challenge of keeping costs down. In some ways, though, AMD can't lose, said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. If it works, AMD will gain entry into the market for high-end servers without having to spend huge amounts in research and development. If it doesn't work, the company will have a fast desktop processor. AMD will also potentially enjoy an advantage in convenience. Migrating to a new instruction set is painful, difficult and expensive for everybody, including the chipmaker and software developer. "As long as you maintain binary compatibility, it becomes a no-brainer because there are no software compatibility issues," Brookwood said. AMD, in fact, won't be the first company with an ambidextrous chip. In 1985, Intel was working on a 32-bit chip called the 432 to replace the 16-bit 286. The 432 contained an entirely new instruction set. "It was going to be a really nifty machine. All the serious architects were working on it," Brookwood said. Intel, however, killed the project and instead released the 386, a 32-bit version of the 286 that also read 16-bit code. One of the chief engineers on the project was Pat Gelsinger, who has since become Intel's chief technical officer. "The second string became heroes," Brookwood said.;

## Analyzing the Sentiment of the Article Towards Itanium

The article's primary goal is to introduce AMD's upcoming 64-bit processor, Sledgehammer, and highlight its advantages over Intel's Itanium. While it acknowledges Itanium's existence, the article focuses on comparing and contrasting the two approaches to 64-bit computing and emphasizes the benefits of AMD's "conservative" approach, which involves maintaining compatibility with existing 32-bit software.

The article presents a negative view of Itanium in a number of ways:

**Strengths of Itanium:**

* **Performance:** The article acknowledges that Itanium is designed for optimal performance with 64-bit chips. However, it also points out that this optimization comes at the cost of compatibility with existing software. This can be interpreted as a subtle criticism, as AMD's Sledgehammer is touted for its compatibility. 
    * **Sentiment:** [Performance: 0] - While acknowledging its potential, it doesn't explicitly praise Itanium's performance. 
* **Error detection and correction:**  The article doesn't mention anything specific about Itanium's error detection and correction capabilities.
    * **Sentiment:** [Error detection and correction: 0] - No information provided.

**Criticisms of Itanium:**

* **Development delays:** The article implicitly criticizes Itanium's development delays by mentioning that it's "slated to appear in samples by late 2001". This indirectly suggests that Itanium's release has been delayed, which can be seen as a negative point.
    * **Sentiment:** [Development delays: -1] -  Implied negativity through the mention of delayed samples.
* **Software support:** The article emphasizes the difficulty and cost of migrating to a new instruction set, as is required for Itanium. It suggests that the need to write entirely new software for Itanium will hinder its adoption.
    * **Sentiment:** [Software support: -2] -  Negative implications about the challenges of migrating to Itanium's new instruction set.
* **Complexity:** The article points out that Intel and HP developed a completely new instruction set for Itanium, making it a more complex solution compared to AMD's approach. This complexity is presented as a disadvantage for developers and software users. 
    * **Sentiment:** [Complexity: -1] - Indirectly criticizes Itanium for being more complex and disruptive.

**Overall:**

The article clearly favors AMD's Sledgehammer over Itanium. While not explicitly attacking Itanium, it presents a negative outlook by highlighting the challenges and limitations of Itanium's approach, while emphasizing the advantages of AMD's more "conservative" strategy.


**Final Sentiment Scores:**

[Performance: 0], [Development delays: -1], [Software support: -2], [Complexity: -1], [Price: 0]

2002-01-02 - The Intel insider

Article:
Paul Otellini once seriously considered becoming a lawyer. Then he reconsidered--a smart decision: After twenty-seven years in the trenches, he?s now one of the highest-ranking executives at Intel. Throughout that long career, the 51-year-old Otellini has played a part in many of the important events shaping the company. His various roles have ranged from managing relations with IBM in the early 1980s to running sales and marketing for the entire company. He oversaw Intel?s push into Ethernet silicon and PC chipsets and also served as technical assistant to former CEO Andy Grove. Since 1998, Otellini has been in charge of the Intel Architecture Group, which means he is responsible for PC, workstation and server processors as well as research and development. And ever since the transfer in power last year that officially elevated Craig Barrett to CEO, Otellini has been frequently mentioned as one of the top candidates to be next in line for the No. 1 job at Intel. But that's--possibly--the future and Otellini has more than enough on this plate in the here and now. The challenges are increasing, what with the drop-off in the economy in the last year and a half as well as Intel's new mobile processors smaller, fasterPaul Otellini, VP, Intel Architecture Group stepped-up competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices. What's more, Otellini has to keep his eye on the payoff from a restructuring of Intel's microprocessor business in the last year as he looks to refashion a more nimble and responsive organization. Otellini, who spends about 40 percent of his time on the road, recently sat down with CNET News.com to talk about the business and what's on tap in the near future as Intel seeks to spur more people to buy systems based on its P4 chip. Q: You're out there in the trenches, so to speak. How does it look in the PC market right now? How does it look for the second half? Our view is that the industry should return to normal growth patterns in the second half. For long-term growth in 2002 to 2007 or 2008, our view is that it returns to the trend line. Historically the first half is bigger than the second half. Would you care to comment on the rivalry with AMD? No.What is it about processors that get people so riled up? The rabidness tends to be a very small segment of the population. The computer industry is 150 million units per year--and the number of tech zealots is under 10 percent. You and I may happen to live in that world, but it's like living in Washington, D.C. You think everyone is into politics.Can you compare 2001 to 1998, when you first stepped into your current job and the semiconductor market also took a downturn? I think it's almost an incomparable year. Depending on how the year sorts out, it's very close to being the first no growth year in the history of the PC. Based upon that, there's really been nothing in the 20 years it's been out that compares to this. I think about that a lot. Is this the beginning of a trend or a reflection of the market we saw in 1999 and 2000? I think it was the latter. Demand was above the trend line. It accelerated in 1999 and 2000. Some of that had to do with the Y2K prepurchases and there was the Internet boom. If you take 1999, 2000 and 2001 together and divide by three you get a much more accurate picture. What made you decide to cut prices on Pentium 4 in April? Was it a specific incident? Or was there a consensus inside Intel that price cuts were needed to get the chip moving? We cut the prices on every product every quarter. The April move was very consistent with that. The more interesting view of that is what we talked about in the (second-quarter earnings) analyst call where we talked about being even more aggressive with Pentium 4 throughout the rest of this year to essentially drive it into the mainstream. So were those price cuts way overblown? I do believe that the moves we made were a significant acceleration versus our prior trends. We are going to push the Pentium 4 to transition from the Pentium IIII, and we're driving the P4 down to mainstream price points from $800 on up. That was driven by three things: the health of the product, overall capacity and the introduction of the 845 chipset ahead of schedule. Does the state of the PC market worry you at all? Analysts say that the majority of PCs are being purchased at prices that range from $800 to $1200 and that there is little activity at prices above $1500. Does this mean that Intel will have to permanently change its processor pricing structure to offer lower priced chips that fit into this band? Or is this a function of the current market? That's what Celeron was all about. When we introduced it, it was to satisfy prices under $1000 and now it?s under $800. I think there's a long-term kind of secular trend here, in terms of the electronics to become increasingly integrated and (manufacturers) to pass on the cost savings. Graphics, I think, is a very good example. Most of our chipsets include integrated graphics now. For the low-end PCs, the very function of integration takes $10 to $20 out of the bill of materials. That's happening in every element of the computer. There's no need to rethink pricing. Our entire business model is set up to displace our old products with our new products. We all heard what you said during Intel's Q2 financial analyst conference call: "We will do what we need to do to transition from the Pentium III to the Pentium 4." What did you mean by that? Our entire business model is predicated on displacing our older product line with newer products. We have been doing this as a company for over 30 years and in the PC arena for 20 years. We will use our design, marketing and manufacturing assets to make the transition from Pentium III to Pentium 4 happen as quickly as possible. With price cuts in effect and the 845 chipset shipping relatively soon, do you feel Pentium 4 is about to come into its own? It's already in major volumes. We said the volumes doubled again this quarter. We'll just continue to grow over the year. The industry now is very much a price point displacement model. If you hit the right price point?people will always take better technology. The new platform (Pentium 4) and a new OS (Windows XP) is incentive for people to upgrade. There's something like 50 million Pentium IIs out there under 500MHz and another 50 million Pentium IIIs at 500MHz. You've got a potential for upgrades that hasn't existed for a number of years. Pentium 4 will hit 2GHz very soon. What do you expect people to do with processors of that speed? What do you think when you hear people say that you don't need that kind or processing power? I have literally had that same question asked of me for the last 25 years. I think that's bunk. Would you be happy with your 286 or your 386 or your Pentium 100? No. The beauty of the industry is that the software grows to consume the MIPS that are available. They demand more MIPS to get similar performance as the previous generation. Ask anyone who's doing advanced work--photography or ripping CDs or home videos--and they'll tell you, 'Give me more MIPS.' I have a 20-year-old son. This is how he spends his time. He's always bugging me for a faster computer.What will the PC look like in five years, aside from faster processors? It will be smaller, faster and wirelessly connected. Always connected--there will be a seamless connection for the devices you use with it (such as PDAs.)What about servers? You must have breathed a sigh of relief when Itanium finally "shipped" How important is Itanium to Intel? Incredibly important. It is our desire to move it into the very highest ends of enterprise computing. You've seen essentially every major computer company in the world, except one, firmly committed to it. As you get that kind of commonality, the software environment tends to follow very rapidly. In this space, it's not just about the microprocessor; it's about the capability of the platform. That is jelling now. I think it gets more interesting next year, when you see second-generation (McKinley) systems, especially coupled with technologies such as Infiniband. It becomes very interesting in terms of the ability to run every aspect of computing in this architecture.How did you arrive at the recent deal with Compaq, which plans to phase out its Alpha chip in favor of Itanium? Suffice it to say that doing proprietary microprocessors is a bloody expensive business. Doing any microprocessor is a bloody expensive business. If you're amortizing that cost over a few units, it's even more prohibitive. Differentiation is not in the processor. Compaq came to the same conclusion that HP did--which is that I can use my engineers to do other stuff because Intel can do (the chips) better and cheaper. Where is Intel going with its mobile processors? My sense is that Intel will begin segmenting that market even more, starting in 2003 with the successor to the Pentium III-M. Will we see a new Pentium brand at that point? It's too soon to predict that. There will be no brand before there is time. I do think the trend is correct in that we're now developing specific products for mobile. Ultimately, the ability to build in seamless connectivity and to have very low power consumption are the vectors that we have the team on today. Realizing that decisions on adopting technology must be made years ahead, we'll just cut to the chase on this one. Was Rambus a mistake? Hindsight is wonderful. The technology is not problematic. The technology is still the best technology out there for showing off the microprocessor. The problem is the cost structure. The cost structure never met the goals we had. I look back and say for the time, I really think it was the right technology. What's the future for the Architecture Group? Some analysts have suggested it would become a cash cow of sorts for Intel, meaning that it will provide steady revenues for the company but grow at a much slower pace than other businesses. Our goal is to grow as quickly as the computing markets we serve will allow and to grow our revenue per computer over time. I absolutely do not view Intel Architecture Group as a cash cow. We are investing to grow our business and capture new revenues. Following up, has Intel's overall Internet building blocks approach been sidetracked by the lousy semiconductor market of late? Any changes to that strategy in the works? There have been no changes to our fundamental strategies. What's next, Paul? Are you Craig Barrett's successor? You'll have to ask Craig and the board. I don't think I'll get a vote. Craig has said very skillfully and elegantly that there are a number of senior managers at Intel that have the potential to move up.;

Title:
2002-01-02 - The week in review Microsoft's landmark

Article:
Microsoft at last introduced Windows 2000, an ambitious attempt to make up ground in the high-end computing world. The business-use software, which the giant hopes will make inroads on the server computers that power Web sites while staving off fast-growing Linux, marks an industry milestone because numerous other companies are expecting to benefit as corporate buyers begin upgrading to the more robust system. Hardware manufacturers and chipmakers are expected to fare best; software makers and component suppliers can also expect benefits.Transition In the making since 1996, Windows 2000 is a great deal more sophisticated--and stable--than its predecessor, Windows NT 4. But the transition won't be smooth for about a quarter of those who make the change, according to a prominent consulting firm, and many companies will take their time. Additionally, licensing fees represent an incremental cost that can make the software expensive. Many predict the notebook segment will adopt the software the fastest because it is more reliable than previous Microsoft operating systems and exploits the best features of corporate notebooks, such as power management. Longtime partners Microsoft and Intel appear at odds over the key question of processor power needed to run Windows 2000. The latter asserted Windows 2000 requires up to 250 more megahertz of chip power for performance equivalent to Windows 98 or Windows NT. The pronouncement symbolizes the widening gap between the two companies, whose partnership has been so close that it has been dubbed "Wintel" within the industry. Microsoft also faces the twin challenges of Linux and the Internet, both unforeseen just a few years ago. The first has established itself as a cheaper alternative and been embraced by almost as many computer companies as Windows, altering the assumption that Microsoft would become the de facto choice for low-end servers. The second has boosted the market for Unix-based servers; in particular, Sun Microsystems has strengthened its position as the dominant choice for servers to power corporate Web sites. Microsoft contends Windows 2000 is more mature than Linux and less expensive than Sun's Solaris.Rivalry Intel is feuding with Sun: The chipmaker said that Sun hasn't been pulling its weight in a joint effort to develop Solaris for Intel's forthcoming Itanium chip and that it will drastically reduce the resources it's devoting to the project. Sun's UltraSparc chip is already established in the 64-bit processor market. Separately, Intel demonstrated a processor running at 1.5 GHz and said it will release Pentium IIIs running at 1 GHz or faster by the second half of the year. Intel and Advanced Micro Devices have been engaged in a game of one-upmanship since last summer, when AMD released its touted Athlon processor, and both have advanced their product "road maps." Magazines named for popular software, operating systems and program languages such as Linux and Perl are springing up in bookstores everywhere. While readership has been strong, the real engine behind the boom in tech trade publications has been advertising. Established players as well as start-ups flush with unprecedented venture capital investments are earmarking big chunks of their budgets for marketing. Asia's two-year PC crisis apparently is over, meliorated by the region's economic expansion and the rise of the Internet, according to a report. Shipments to China, Korea, Indonesia, India, Vietnam and elsewhere (but not Japan) rose to more than 14.1 million units in 1999, the highest annual figure ever and a sign that the regional economic downturn is on the mend.Just business An old guard of transportation, gas and other utility companies is contending with the ambitious new broadband industry over the wireless spectrum--the invisible, intangible "airwaves" that carry TV signals, radio waves and wireless phone calls. Owners of private systems typically used by taxi services, for instance, are asking federal regulators for more air space, while young digital outfits are fighting to win rights to the same air space so they can offer profitable new high-speed data and communication services. Since 1994, U.S. regulators have auctioned off large slices of spectrum to wireless phone and other companies, raising close to $20 billion in the process. Lucent insisted the company is fixing the problems that caused its first-ever earnings shortfall, considered by analysts as the most significant hurdle it has faced since spinning off from AT&T in 1996. Lucent's woes contrast with the runaway success of networking competitors Cisco Systems and Nortel Networks, as well as continued growth from a variety of start-ups. Nortel's October 1999 announcement that it would acquire Clarify predictably sent the customer relationship management company's shares soaring. But Nortel too has surged, buoyed by strong financial results and plans to expand. The Brampton, Ont., company, whose stock has more than doubled in four months, said it will spend $260 million and add 3,400 people to meet demand for its fiber-optic network equipment.Consolidating? Several executives involved in Time Warner's Internet efforts have resigned or been reassigned following the company's announced merger with America Online, renewing questions about the media and entertainment giant's online plans. The most recent move involves the chief operating officer at Time Warner Digital Media. Employee stock options in Time Warner instantly vested upon approval of the buyout, and seem to be contributing to an exodus of executive shareholders. Healtheon/WebMD agreed to buy Medical Manager and its subsidiary CareInsite, an Internet-based health care network for physicians, suppliers and patients, in a stock deal valued at roughly $5 billion. The Atlanta company has made a string of buys within the last month. Critical Path, hoping to persuade big companies to move their email, fax and other messaging services online, has decided to move its Net-based products offline for those corporations that still prefer to be in-house. The strategic switch marks a realization that the business market for outsourced communications isn't taking off quite yet. In a deal that consolidates the sluggish online bill-payment market, CheckFree agreed to buy Microsoft-backed TransPoint for in a stock swap worth about $1 billion. Consumers have been reluctant to embrace online billing because of its inconvenience--bill-paying services typically don't allow users to settle all of their accounts--and the move suggests that building the market may be more important than bare-knuckled competition at this stage of the game.Thinking about it Ask Jeeves scuttled a proposal to spin off its sex-related answers to a separate Web site called Mimi. The company had been mulling its sex strategy for months, toeing a fine line between endangering its family-friendly brand and giving up a source of traffic and revenue from the popular and lucrative online pornography trade. Internet advertising network DoubleClick acknowledged an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into its practice of collecting consumer information, and a separate probe by Michigan's attorney general. In recent weeks, federal officials have launched inquiries into some of the top names in online business, including Amazon.com, eBay and eToys, as consumers spend increasing amounts of time and money online--and file record numbers of complaints. Canadian law officials investigated a Montreal-based Internet service provider in search of an anonymous hacker called "mafiaboy," while universities that were taken over and used in last week's attacks on sites including Yahoo, eBay and CNN said they can't guarantee their systems won't be used as launching points again. President Clinton met with Internet executives to discuss the situation.Also of note Apple announced a revamped line of notebooks for professionals, an upgraded iBook for consumers and faster chips in its corporate desktop computers ... Veterans of Apple and AOL are setting their sights on the Macintosh equivalent of Linux, working on a graphical user interface for the open-source operating system ... PointCast sent an email to subscribers announcing the final broadcast of news and information over its "push" network ... H&R Block's online tax filing service exposed some customers' sensitive financial records to other customers last weekend, prompting the company to shut down the system ... A growing number of consumers are in tune with how television and the Internet can interact, according to a new study ... As the Internet becomes more integrated with Americans' lives, people are spending less time with friends and family, shopping in stores, or watching television and instead are working longer hours by bringing their work home, according to another report.;
