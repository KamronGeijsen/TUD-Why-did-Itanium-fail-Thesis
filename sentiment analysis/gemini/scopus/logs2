2000-01-01 - Formal verification of VLIW microprocessors with speculative execution

Article:
This is a study of the formal verification of a VLIW microprocessor that imitates the Intel Itanium [9][12][17] in features such as predicated execution, register remapping, advanced and speculative loads, and branch prediction. The formal verification is done with the Burch and Dill flushing technique [5] by exploiting the properties of Positive Equality [3][4]. The contributions include an extensive use of conservative approximations in abstracting portions of the processor and a framework for decomposition of the Boolean evaluation of the correctness formula. The conservative approximations are applied automatically when abstracting a memory whose forwarding logic is not affected by stalling conditions that preserve the correctness of the memory semantics for the same memory. These techniques allow a reduction of more than a factor of 4 in the CPU time for the formal verification of the most complex processor model examined relative to the monolithic evaluation of the correctness formula for a version of the same processor where conservative approximations are not applied.

2000-01-01 - Wavefront scheduling: Path based data representation and scheduling of subgraphs

Article:
The IA-64 architecture is rich with features that enable aggressive exploitation of instruction-level parallelism. Features such as speculation, predication, multiway branches and others provide compilers with new opportunities for the extraction of parallelism in programs. Code scheduling is a central component in any compiler for the IA-64 architecture. This paper describes the implementation of the global code scheduler (GCS) in Intel's compiler for the IA-64 architecture. GCS schedules code over acyclic regions of control flow. There is a tight coupling between the formation and scheduling of regions. GCS employs a new path based data dependence representation that combines control now and data dependence information to make data analysis easy and accurate. This paper provides details of this representation. The scheduler uses a novel instruction scheduling technique called Wavefront scheduling. The concepts of wavefront scheduling and deferred compensation are explained to demonstrate the efficient generation of compensation code while scheduling. This paper also presents P-ready code motion, an opportunistic instruction level tail duplication which aims to strike a balance between code expansion and performance potential. Performance results show greater than 30% improvement in speedup for wavefront scheduling over basic block scheduling on the Itanium microarchitecture. .

2001-01-01 - A specification methodology by a collection of compact properties as applied to the Intel Itanium processor bus protocol

Article:
In practice, formal specifications are often considered too costly for the benefits they promise. Specifically, interface specifications such as standard bus protocol descriptions are still documented informally, and although many admit formal versions would be useful, they are dissuaded by the time and effort needed for development. We champion a formal specification methodology that attacks this costvalue problem from two angles. First, the framework allows formal specifications to be feasible for signal-level bus protocols with minimal effort, lowering costs. And second, a specification written in this style has many different uses, other than as a precise specification document, resulting in increased value over cost. This methodology allows the specification to be easily transformed into an executable checker or an simulation environment, for example. In an earlier paper, we demonstrated the methodology on a widelyused bus protocol. Now, we show that the generalized methodology can be applied to more advanced bus protocols, in particular, the Intel ItaniumTM Processor bus protocol. In addition, the paper outlines how writing and checking such a specification revealed interesting issues, such as deadlock and missed data phases, during the development of the protocol.

2001-01-01 - Calculation of Load Invalidation Rates for Data Speculation

Article:
For wide and in-order-issue processors like the Intel Itanium Processor Family (IFF), a memory load operation often appears on a critical execution path. When a load may cause a cache miss, it is even more important to move it early to hide its latency. However, a load is potentially dependent upon stores preceding it in a program. This makes it difficult to schedule the load before the stores. Compiler generated data speculation has been provided as a runtime disambiguation mechanism in IFF, which allows a compiler to move a load before a store even when the two operations are aliased. However, data speculation is effective only if the speculatively executed load is not frequently invalidated by the aliased stores; otherwise, costly runtime recovery code can severely degrade performance. In this paper, we define the concept of "conflict region" and use it to precisely formulate the invalidation rate problem. We solve the problem by decomposing it into two sub-problems: the address invalidation probability problem and the common path probability problem. We provide solutions to both with static analysis for array references inside loops.  (2001) by the International Society for Computers and Their Applications All rights reserved. .

Specifically, it addresses the challenge of optimizing memory load operations by using data speculation to potentially move a load before a store, even if they might be aliased. The goal is to quantify the effectiveness of this approach by calculating the invalidation rate of speculatively executed loads.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article acknowledges the unique challenges posed by the Itanium architecture's wide and in-order-issue design. It explicitly mentions the need to optimize load operations for such processors because they often appear on critical execution paths. This highlights the importance of addressing performance issues specific to Itanium. 

The article also recognizes the benefit of compiler-generated data speculation in the Itanium architecture, stating that it provides "a runtime disambiguation mechanism" to move loads before stores.

2001-01-01 - Memory performance analysis of SPEC2000C for the Intel Itanium processor

Article:
We describe our memory performance analysis of SPEC2000C using the newly released Intel Itanium processor (IPF). Memory overhead is very significant for SPEC200OC; on the average 39% cycles are spent in data stalls. Cache misses are significant, but also data translation performance (DTLB) affects many benchmarks. We present a study based on collecting measurements from the hardware performance counters and cache profiling using program instrumentation of loads/stores. We define important loads as the load sites that contribute at least 95% of the cache misses at all levels. Our measurements show that the number of important loads in a program is relatively small. Our analysis show that important loads are most of the time contained in inner loops, and that the trip counts of these loops is significantly high. We present preliminary results on using stride profiling to reduce cache misses of important loads, bringing an average of 6% improvement to SPEC2000C. Finally, we present our study of data translation performance and propose design choices.  2001 IEEE. .

2001-01-01 - Optimizing software data prefetches with rotating registers

Article:
Software data prefetching is a well-known technique to improve the performance of programs that suffer many cache misses at several levels of memory hierarchy. However, it has significant overhead in terms of increased code size, additional instructions, and possibly increased memory bus traffic due to redundant prefetches. This paper presents two novel methods to reduce the overhead of software data prefetching and improve the program performance by optimized prefetch scheduling. These methods exploit the availability of rotating registers and predication in architectures sit ch as the Itanium architecture. The methods (1) minimize redundant prefetches, (2) reduce the number of issue slots needed for prefetch instructions, and (3) avoid branch mispredict penalties - all with minimal code size increase. Compared to traditional data prefetching techniques, these methods (i) do not require loop unrolling, (ii) do not require predicate computations and (iii) require fewer machine resources. One of these methods has been implemented in the Intel Production Compiler for the Itanium processor. This technique is compared with traditional approaches for software prefetching and experimental results are presented based on the floating-point benchmark suite of CPU2000. .

2001-01-01 - Register renaming and scheduling for dynamic execution of predicated code

Article:
To achieve higher processor performance requires greater synergy between advanced hardware features and innovative compiler techniques. Recent advancement in compilation techniques for predicated execution has provided significant opportunity in exploiting instruction level parallelism. However, little research has been done on how to efficiently execute predicated code in a dynamic microarchitecture. In this paper, we evaluate hardware optimizations for executing predicated code on a dynamically scheduled microarchitecture. We provide two novel ideas to improve the efficiency of executing predicated code. On a generic Intel Itanium processor pipeline model, we demonstrate that, with some microarchitecture enhancements, a dynamic execution processor can achieve about 16% performance improvement over an equivalent static execution processor. .

2001-01-01 - Speculative precomputation: Long-range prefetching of delinquent loads

Article:
This paper explores Speculative Precomputation, a technique that uses idle thread contexts in a multithreaded architecture to improve performance of single-threaded applications. It attacks program stalls from data cache misses by pre-computing future memory accesses in available thread contexts, and prefetching these data. This technique is evaluated by simulating the performance of a research processor based on the Itanium ISA supporting Simultaneous Multithreading. Two primary forms of Speculative Precomputation are evaluated. If only the non-speculative thread spawns speculative threads, performance gains of up to 30% are achieved when assuming ideal hardware. However, this speedup drops considerably with more realistic hardware assumptions. Permitting speculative threads to directly spawn additional speculative threads reduces the overhead associated with spawning threads and enables significantly more aggressive speculation, overcoming this limitation. Even with realistic costs for spawning threads, speedups as high as 169% are achieved, with an average speedup of 76%. .

2001-01-01 - Statistical clock skew modeling with data delay variations

Article:
Accurate clock skew budgets are important for microprocessor designers to avoid hold-time failures and to properly allocate resources when optimizing global and local paths. Many published clock skew budgets neglect voltage jitter and process variation, which are becoming dominant factors in otherwise balanced H-trees. However, worst-case process variation assumptions are severely pessimistic. This paper describes the major sources of clock skew in a microprocessor using a modified H-tree and applies the model to a second-generation Itanium-M processor family microprocessor currently under design. Monte Carlo simulation is used to develop statistical clock skew budgets for setup and hold time constraints in a four-level skew hierarchy. Voltage jitter through the phase locked loop (PLL) and clock buffers accounts for the majority of skew budgets. We show that taking into account the number of nearly critical paths between clocked elements at each level of the skew hierarchy and variations in the data delays of these paths reduces the difference between global and local skew budgets by more than a factor of two. Another insight is that data path delay variability limits the potential cycle-time benefits of active deskew circuits because the paths with the worst skew are unlikely to also be the paths with the longest data delays. .

2001-01-01 - The impact of if-conversion and branch prediction on program execution on the Intel Itanium processor

Article:
The research community has studied if-conversion for many years. However, due to the lack of existing hardware, studies were conducted by simulating code generated by experimental compilers. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of the use of predication to implement if-conversion on production hardware with a near-production compiler. To better understand trends in the measurements, we generated binaries at three increasing levels of if-conversion aggressiveness. For each level, we gathered data regarding the global runtime effects of if-conversion on overall execution time, register pressure, code size, and branch behavior. Furthermore, we studied the inherent characteristics of program control-flow structure related to branching to help determine fundamental limits of if-conversion. Our results show that on the Itanium processor if-conversion could potentially remove 29% of the branch mispredictions in SPEC2000CINT but that this accounts for a substantially smaller overall program speedup than previously reported. .

2002-01-01 - A specification and verification framework for developing weak shared memory consistency protocols

Article:
A specification and verification methodology for Distributed Shared Memory consistency protocols implementing weakshared memory consistency models is proposed. Our approach uniformly describes a wide range of weakmemory models in terms of a single conceptthe visibility order of loads, stores, and synchronization operations, as perceived by all the processors. A given implementation is correct with respect to a weakmemory model if it produces executions satisfying the visibility order for that memory model. Given an implementation, the designer annotates it with events from the visibility order, and runs reachability analysis to verify it against a specification that is also similarly annotated. A specification is obtained in two stages: first, the designer reverse engineers an intermediate abstraction from the implementation by replacing the coherence networkwith a logically equivalent concurrent data structure. The replacement is selected in a standard way, depending almost exclusively on the memory model. Verification of the intermediate abstraction against a visibility order specification can be accomplished using theorem-proving. The methodology was applied to four snoopybus protocols implementing aspects of the Alpha and Itanium memory models, with encouraging results.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002. .

## Analysis of the Article and Sentiment Towards Itanium

The article focuses on developing a methodology for specifying and verifying the correctness of Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) consistency protocols. This methodology aims to provide a unified framework for describing and analyzing a wide range of weak memory models, which are models that relax the strict ordering of memory operations, potentially leading to performance gains but posing greater challenges for correctness verification.

The key contribution of the article lies in its use of "visibility order" to represent the order in which memory operations (loads, stores, synchronizations) become visible to different processors. This concept allows for a uniform description of various weak memory models. The authors propose a two-stage verification process:

1. **Abstraction:** The designer first abstracts the implementation by replacing the coherence network (responsible for maintaining consistency) with a logically equivalent concurrent data structure. This abstraction is chosen based on the memory model being implemented.
2. **Verification:** The abstracted implementation is then verified against the visibility order specification using reachability analysis and potentially theorem proving.

The article explicitly mentions applying this methodology to four snoopy-bus protocols, which are a common type of coherence protocol.  **Importantly, it notes that these protocols implement aspects of both the Alpha and Itanium memory models.** This suggests that the methodology is flexible enough to handle different memory models, including those used in modern architectures like Itanium.

**However, the article does not delve into specific details about Itanium.** It focuses on the general framework and its application to a range of protocols, without offering any particular insights or criticisms about Itanium. 

**Therefore, the article's sentiment towards Itanium is neutral.** It simply acknowledges Itanium as a relevant architecture with a particular memory model that can be addressed by the proposed methodology.

2002-01-01 - An EPIC processor with pending functional units

Article:
The Itanium processor, an implementation of an Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) architecture, is an in-order processor that fetches, executes, and forwards results to functional units in-order. The architecture relies heavily on the compiler to expose Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) to avoid stalls created by in-order processing. The goal of this paper is to examine, in small steps, changing the in-order Itanium processor model to allow execution to be performed out-of-order. The purpose is to overcome memory and functional unit latencies. To accomplish this, we consider an architecture with Pending Functional Units (PFU). The PFU architecture assigns/schedules instructions to functional units in-order. Instructions sit at the pending functional units until their operands become ready and then execute out-of-order. While an instruction is pending at a functional unit, no other instruction can be scheduled to that functional unit. We examine several PFU architecture designs. The minimal design does not perform renaming, and only supports bypassing of non-speculative result values. We then examine making PFU more aggressive by supporting speculative register state, and then finally by adding in register renaming. We show that the minimal PFU architecture provides on average an 18% speedup over an in-order EPIC processor and produces up to half of the speedup that would be gained using a full out-of-order architecture.  2002 Springer Berlin Heidelberg. .

2002-01-01 - Combining shared and distributed memory programming models on clusters of symmetric multiprocessors: Some basic promising experiments

Article:
This note presents some experiments on different clusters of SMPs, where both distributed and shared memory parallel programming paradigms can be naturally combined. Although the platforms exhibit the same macroscopic memory organization, it appears that their individual overall performance is closely dependent on the ability of their hardware to efficiently exploit the local shared memory within the nodes. In that context, cache blocking strategy appears to be very important not only to get good performance out of each individual processor but mainly good performance out of the overall computing node since sharing memory locally might become a severe bottleneck. On a very simple benchmark, representative of many large simulation codes, we show through numerical experiments that mixing the two programming models enables us to get attractive speed-ups that compete with a pure distributed memory approach. This opens promising perspectives for smoothly moving large industrial codes developed on distributed vector computers with a moderate number of processors on these emerging platforms for intensive scientific computing that are the clusters of SMPs.  2002 Sage Publications. .

With the recent introduction of Itanium Processor Family (IPF) microprocessors for enterprise servers it is imperative to understand the behavior of server class applications. This paper analyzes the behavior of the Oracle Database Benchmark (ODB), an online transaction processing (OLTP) workload, and compares it with SPEC CPU2000. This study examines code mix, instruction and data supply, and value locality. The results show that while IPF's bundle constraints cause a large injection of NOPs into the code stream, IPFs register stack engine successfully reduces the number of memory operations by nearly 50%. The control-flow predictability of ODB is better than CPU2000, in spite of ODB's large active branch footprint. Due to ODB's large memory footprint, cache misses (particularly instruction cache misses) are a much more serious problem than in CPU2000.  2002 IEEE. .

2002-01-01 - Efficient discovery of regular stride patterns in irregular programs and its use in compiler prefetching

Article:
Irregular data references are difficult to prefetch, as the future memory address of a load instruction is hard to anticipate by a compiler. However, recent studies as well as our experience indicate that some important load instructions in irregular programs contain stride access patterns. Although the load instructions with stride patterns are difficult to identify with static compiler techniques, we developed an efficient profiling method to discover these load instructions. The new profiling method integrates the profiling for stride information and the traditional profiling for edge frequency into a single profiling pass. The integrated profiling pass runs only 17% slower than the frequency profiling alone. The collected stride information helps the compiler to identify load instructions with stride patterns that can be prefetched efficiently and beneficially. We implemented the new profiling and prefetching techniques in a research compiler for Itanium Processor Family (IPF), and obtained significant performance improvement for the SPECINT2000 programs running on Itanium machines. For example, we achieved a 1.59x speedup for 181.mcf, 1.14x for 254.gap, and 1.08x for 197.parser. We also showed that the performance gain is stable across input data sets. These benefits make the new profiling and prefetching techniques suitable for production compilers. .

2002-01-01 - Eliminating exception constraints of Java programs for IA-64

Article:
Java exception checks are designed to ensure that any, faulting instruction causing a hardware exception does not terminate the program abnormally. These checks, however, impose some constraints upon the execution order between an instruction potentially raising a Java exception and a faulting instruction causing a hardware exception. This reduces the effectiveness of instruction reordering optimization. We propose a new framework to effectively perform speculation for the Java language using a direct acyclic graph representation based on the SSA form. Using this framework, we apply a well-known speculation technique to a faulting load instruction to eliminate such constraints. We use edges to represent exception constraints. This allows us to accurately estimate the potential reduction of the critical path length for applying speculation. We also propose an approach to avoid extra copy instructions and to generate efficient code with minimum register pressure. We have implemented the technique in the IBM Java Just-In-Time compiler, and observed performance improvements up to 25% for micro-benchmark programs, up to 10% for Java Grande Benchmark Suite, and up to 12% for SPECjvm98 on an Itanium processor.  2002 IEEE. .

1. **The launch of Itanium 2:** This indicates the article is likely to discuss the release of this new processor.
2. **Intel's disappointing Q2 results:** This suggests a possible link between the Itanium 2 launch and Intel's financial performance.

While we don't have the full article content, the title alone suggests a **mixed sentiment** towards Itanium. The fact that the launch is described as "awaited and belated" implies anticipation but also a sense of delay, possibly hinting at skepticism about the processor's impact. 

Furthermore, the juxtaposition of the launch with Intel's disappointing results suggests that the Itanium 2 might not be seen as a solution to the company's financial woes. This could be interpreted as a sign of **indirect negativity** towards Itanium. 

**Conclusion:** Based on the limited information, the article's sentiment towards Itanium is likely **[-1] - Signs of critique**. The title hints at a complex relationship between the launch and Intel's performance, potentially implying a degree of skepticism or concern about the Itanium 2's success.

2002-01-01 - Just-in-time Java compilation for the Itanium processor

Article:
This paper describes a just-in-time (JIT) Java compiler for the Intel Itanium processor. The Itanium processor is an example of an Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) architecture and thus relies on aggressive and expensive compiler optimizations for performance. Static compilers for Itanium use aggressive global scheduling algorithms to extract instruction-level parallelism. In a JIT compiler, however, the additional overhead of such expensive optimizations may offset any gains from the improved code. In this paper, we describe lightweight code generation techniques for generating efficient Itanium code. Our compiler relies on two basic methods to generate efficient code. First, the compiler uses inexpensive scheduling heuristics to model the Itanium microarchitecture. Second, the compiler uses the semantics of the Java virtual machine to extract instruction-level parallelism.  2002 IEEE. .

2002-01-01 - Memory latency-tolerance approaches for Itanium processors: Out-of-order execution vs. speculative precomputation

Article:
The performance of in-order execution Itanium processors can suffer significantly due to cache misses. Two memory latency tolerance approaches can be applied for the Itanium processors. One uses an out-of-order (OOO) execution core; the other assumes multithreading support and exploits cache prefetching via speculative precomputation (SP). This paper evaluates and contrasts these two approaches. In addition, this paper assesses the effectiveness of combining the two approaches. For a select set of memory-intensive programs, an in-order SMT Itanium processor using speculative precomputation can achieve performance improvement (92%) comparable to that of an out-of-order design (87%). Applying both 000 and SP yields a total performance improvement of 141% over the baseline in-order machine. OOO tends to be effective in prefetching-for L1 misses; whereas SP is primarily good at covering L2 and L3 misses. Our analysis indicates that the two approaches can be redundant or complementary depending on the type of delinquent loads that each targets. Both approaches are effective on delinquent loads in the loop body; however only SP is effective on delinquent loads found in loop control code.  2002 IEEE. .

2002-01-01 - On the predictability of program behavior using different input data sets

Article:
Smaller input data sets such as the test and the train input sets are commonly used in simulation to estimate the impact of architecture/micro-architecture features on the performance of SPEC benchmarks. They are also used for profile feedback compiler optimizations. In this paper, we examine the reliability of reduced input sets for performance simulation and profile feedback optimizations. We study the high level metrics such as IPC and procedure level profiles as well as lower level measurements such as execution paths exercised by various input sets on the SPEC2000int benchmark. Our study indicates that the test input sets are not suitable to be used for simulation because they do not have an execution profile similar to the reference input runs. The train data set is better than the test data sets at maintaining similar profiles to the reference input set. However, the observed execution paths leading to cache misses are very different between using the smaller input sets and the reference input sets. For current profile based optimizations, the differences in quality of profiles may not have a significant impact on performance, as tested on the Itanium processor with an Intel compiler. However, we believe the impact of profile quality will be greater for more aggressive profile guided optimizations, such as cache prefetching.  2002 IEEE. .

## Analysis of the Article's Sentiment towards Itanium:

The article focuses on the **reliability of reduced input data sets** for performance simulation and profile feedback optimizations. The authors argue that smaller data sets used in simulations might not accurately reflect the behavior of programs when running with larger, "reference" input sets. They specifically compare the performance metrics (IPC, procedure profiles, and execution paths) between smaller input sets (test and train) and the reference input set on the SPEC2000int benchmark.

The authors find that **smaller data sets are not reliable for performance simulation** as they do not generate similar profiles to the reference input set. This finding applies to both test and train data sets. However, the authors recognize that **the train data set shows better resemblance to the reference set compared to the test data set**.

Regarding the **impact of profile quality on optimization**, the authors note that **current profile-based optimizations (as tested on the Itanium processor with an Intel compiler) may not be significantly affected by the differences in profile quality**. However, they **predict a greater impact for more aggressive profile-guided optimizations**, such as cache prefetching.

**Overall, the article's sentiment towards Itanium is neutral.** While the research touches on the impact of profile quality on Itanium's performance, it focuses more on the limitations of reduced input sets for simulation and optimization. The article doesn't explicitly praise or criticize Itanium's performance or its suitability for specific optimizations.  The authors' focus is on the general issue of profile quality and its implications for various optimizations, including those used on Itanium.

2002-01-01 - Peppermint and Sled: Tools for evaluating SMP systems based on IA-64 (IPF) processors

Article:
In this paper, we describe Peppermint and Sled: tools developed for evaluations of computer systems based on IA-64 processors. Sled generates trace from applications running on IA-64 processors, while Peppermint models the complete system using cycle-accurate, trace-driven simulation. Peppermint is based on Augmint, which leaves open the possibility of doing execution-driven simulations in future. Peppermint and Sled allow us to perform a trace-based evaluation of 4 applications running on SMP systems based on Itanium and McKinley processors. We find that the improvement in IPC of McKinley relative to Itanium ranges from 7% to over 100% for our different applications. The improvement can be attributed to a variety of factors. These range from the availability of additional functional units and issue ports in the McKinley processor to our assumption of a better memory system. While the improvement in performance remains valid in SMP systems in some cases, higher contention for system bus and memory reduces the performance gain in other cases. Increasing the system bits bandwidth and size of queues for pending requests in the memory controller are identified as first steps for optimizing SMP performance.  2002 IEEE. . Keywords:;

2002-01-01 - Post-pass binary adaptation for software-based speculative precomputation

Article:
Recently, a number of thread-based prefetching techniques have been proposed. These techniques aim at improving the latency of single-threaded applications by leveraging multithreading resources to perform memory prefetching via speculative prefetch threads. Software-based speculative precomputation (SSP) is one such technique, proposed for multithreaded Itanium models. SSP does not require expensive hardware support-instead it relies on the compiler to adapt binaries to perform prefetching on otherwise idle hardware thread contexts at run time. This paper presents a post-pass compilation tool for generating SSP-enhanced binaries. The tool is able to: (1) analyze a single-threaded application to generate prefetch threads; (2) identify and embed trigger points in the original binary; and (3) produce a new binary that has the prefetch threads attached. The execution of the new binary spawns the speculative prefetch threads, which are executed concurrently with the main thread. Our results indicate that for a set of pointer-intensive benchmarks, the prefetching performed by the speculative threads achieves an average of 87% speedup on an in-order processor and 5% speedup on an out-of-order processor. .

It presents a post-pass compilation tool that can enhance binaries to achieve this. 

The article specifically mentions that SSP was "proposed for multithreaded Itanium models." This implies that the SSP technique was designed with Itanium's multithreading capabilities in mind. The article further highlights that SSP relies on the compiler to adapt binaries for prefetching on "otherwise idle hardware thread contexts at runtime." This suggests that SSP leverages the multithreading architecture of Itanium to perform prefetching on idle cores, potentially improving overall performance.

While the article does not explicitly praise Itanium, it presents SSP as a technique specifically designed for Itanium's multithreading capabilities. The fact that SSP can utilize idle cores suggests a focus on maximizing Itanium's multithreaded architecture, highlighting a positive aspect of the processor.

2002-01-01 - Power-performance trade-offs for energy-efficient architectures: A quantitative study

Article:
The drastic increase in power consumption by modern processors emphasizes the need for power-performance trade-offs in architecture design space exploration and compiler optimizations. This paper reports a quantitative study on the power-performance trade-offs in software pipelined schedules for an Itanium-like EPIC architecture with dual-speed pipelines, in which functional units are partitioned into fast ones and slow ones. We have developed an integer linear programming formulation to capture the power-performance tradeoffs for software pipelined loops. The proposed integer linear programming formulation and its solution method have been implemented and tested on a set of SPEC2000 benchmarks. The results are compared with an Itanium-like architecture(baseline) in which there are four functional units (FUs) and all of them are fast units. Our quantitative study reveals that by introducing a few slow FUs in place of fast Fus in the baseline architecture, the total energy consumed by FUs can be considerably reduced. When 2 out of 4 FUs are set as slow, the total energy consumed by FUs is reduced by up to 31.1% (with an average reduction of 25.2%) compared with the baseline configuration, while the performance degradation caused by using slow FUs is small. If performance demand is less critical, then energy reduction of up to 40.3% compared with the baseline configuration can be achieved. .

2002-01-01 - Quantitative evaluation of the register stack engine and optimizations for future Itanium processors

Article:
This paper examines the efficiency of the register stack engine (RSE) in the canonical Itanium architecture, and introduces novel optimization techniques to enhance the RSE performance. To minimize spills and fills of the physical register file, optimizations are applied to reduce internal fragmentation in statically allocated register stack frames. Through the use of dynamic register usage (DRU) and dead register value information (DVI), the processor can dynamically guide allocation and deallocation of register frames. Consequently, a speculatively allocated register frame with a dynamically determined frame size can be much smaller than the statically determined frame size, thus achieving minimum spills and fills. Using the register stack engine (RSE) in the canonical Itanium architecture as the baseline reference, we thoroughly study and gauge the tradeoffs of the RSE and the proposed optimizations using a set of SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks built with different compiler optimizations. A combination of frame allocation policies using the most frequent frame size and deallocation policies using dead register information proves to be highly effective. On average, a 71% reduction in aggregate spills and fills can be achieved over the baseline reference.  2002 IEEE. .

2002-01-01 - Reuse distance-based cache hint selection

Article:
Modern instruction sets extend their load/store-instructions with cache hints, as an additional means to bridge the processor-memory speed gap. Cache hints are used to specify the cache level at which the data is likely to be found, as well as the cache level where the data is stored after accessing it. In order to improve a programs cache behavior, the cache hint is selected based on the data locality of the instruction. We represent the data locality of an instruction by its reuse distance distribution. The reuse distance is the amount of data addressed between two accesses to the same memory location. The distribution allows to efficiently estimate the cache level where the data will be found, and to determine the level where the data should be stored to improve the hit rate. The Open64 EPIC-compiler was extended with cache hint selection and resulted in speedups of up to 36% in numerical and 23% in non numerical programs on an Itanium multiprocessor.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002. .

2002-01-01 - Shared memory consistency protocol verification against weak memory models: Refinement via model-checking

Article:
Weak shared memory consistency models, especially those used by modern microprocessor families, are quite complex. The bus and/or directory-based protocols that help realize shared memory multiprocessors using these microprocessors are also exceedingly complex. Thus, the correctness problem -that all the executions generated by the multiprocessor for any given concurrent program are also allowed by the memory model -is a major challenge. In this paper, we present a formal approach to verify protocol implementation models against weak shared memory models through automatable refinement checking supported by a model checker. We define a taxonomy of weak shared memory models that includes most published commercial memory models, and detail how our approach applies over all these models. In our approach, the designer follows a prescribed procedure to build a highly simplified intermediate abstraction for the given implementation. The intermediate abstraction and the implementation are concurrently run using a modelchecker, checking for refinement. The intermediate abstraction can be proved correct against the memory model specification using theorem proving. We have verified four different Alpha as well as Itanium memory model implementationsagainst their respective specifications. The results are encouraging in terms of the uniformity of the procedure, the high degree of automation, acceptable run-times, and empirically observed bug-hunting efficacy. The use of parallel model-checking, based on a version of the parallel Mur model checker we have recently developed for the MPI library, has been essential to finish the search in a matter of a few hours.

2002-01-01 - Thermal design of a high-density server

Article:
Numerical simulation and experimental verification have yielded a high-density server concept dissipating a nameplate power of 700 W in a 1U (44.45 mm or 1.75 in) rack-mount form factor. Air-cooled thermal management is achieved through a ducted radial blower, conventional heatsinks, and a partitioned airflow management strategy. It is shown that design and optimization of the air mover system requires attention not only to pressure and flow characteristics, but also to flow distribution properties. Optimizing the system for flow and thermal performance is an iterative process, most easily done before major layout or architectural properties have been fixed. Close collaboration between thermal analysts, board layout engineers, and system architects has proven the most effective method for optimizing the complete server design. .

2002-01-01 - Value-profile guided stride prefetching for irregular code

Article:
Memory operations in irregular code are difficult to prefetch, as the future address of a memory location is hard to anticipate by a compiler. However, recent studies as well as our experience indicatethat many irregular programs contain loads with near-constant strides. This paper presents a novel compiler technique to profile and prefetch for those loads. The profile captures not only the dominant stride values for each profiled load, but also the differences between the successive strides of the load. The profile information helps the compiler to classify load instructions into strongly or weakly strided and singlestrided or phased multi-strided. The prefetching decisions guided by the load classifications are highly selective and beneficial. We obtain significant performance improvement for the CPU2000 integer programs running on Itanium machines. For example, we achieve a 1.55x speedup for "181.mcf", 1.15x for "254.gap", 1.08x for "197.parser" and smaller gains in other benchmarks. We also show that the performance gain is stable across profile data sets and that the profiling overhead is low. These benefits make the new technique suitable for a production compiler.

## Analysis of the Article's Sentiment towards Itanium:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on addressing the challenge of optimizing memory operations in "irregular code," which are notoriously difficult to prefetch due to their unpredictable memory access patterns. To overcome this, the authors propose a novel compiler technique: **value-profile guided stride prefetching**. This technique analyzes the program's memory access patterns during a profiling phase and identifies loads with near-constant strides. Based on this information, the compiler classifies loads into different categories (strongly strided, weakly strided, single-strided, phased multi-strided), allowing for more targeted and effective prefetching strategies.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article **explicitly mentions Itanium machines** as the target platform for their performance evaluation. The authors present **performance gains specifically for CPU2000 integer programs running on Itanium**, demonstrating the effectiveness of their technique in achieving significant speedups for these benchmarks. This indicates a **positive focus on Itanium**, as the authors explicitly choose it as their target platform and showcase the technique's benefits in improving performance on this specific architecture. 

**Furthermore, the authors highlight the technique's suitability for a production compiler**, suggesting its practical value and real-world applicability for optimizing Itanium-based systems.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the explicit focus on Itanium, the presentation of performance gains on Itanium benchmarks, and the emphasis on the technique's practicality for Itanium systems, the article expresses a **positive sentiment towards Itanium**.

2003-01-01 - A framework for modeling and optimization of prescient instruction prefetch

Article:
This paper describes a framework for modeling macroscopic program behavior and applies it to optimizing prescient instruction prefetch - a novel technique that uses helper threads to improve single-threaded application performance by performing judicious and timely instruction prefetch. A helper thread is initiated when the main thread encounters a spawn point, and prefetches instructions starting at a distant target point. The target identifies a code region tending to incur I-cache misses that the main thread is likely to execute soon, even though intervening control flow may be unpredictable. The optimization of spawn-target pair selections is formulated by modeling program behavior as a Markov chain based on profile statistics. Execution paths are considered stochastic outcomes, and aspects of program behavior are summarized via path expression mappings. Mappings for computing reaching, and posteriori probability; path length mean, and variance; and expected path footprint are presented. These are used with Tarjan's fast path algorithm to efficiently estimate the benefit of spawn-target pair selections. Using this framework we propose a spawn-target pair selection algorithm for prescient instruction prefetch. This algorithm has been implemented, and evaluated for the Itanium Processor Family architecture. A limit study finds 4.8% to 17% speedups on an in-order simultaneous multithreading processor with eight contexts, over nextline and streaming I-prefetch for a set of benchmarks with high I-cache miss rates. The framework in this paper is potentially applicable to other thread speculation techniques. Copyright 2003 ACM. .

2003-01-01 - A region-based compilation infrastructure

Article:
The traditional framework for back-end compilation is based on the scope of functions, which is a natural boundary to partition an entire program for compilation. However, the sizes and structures of functions may not be the best scope for program analyses and transformations when considering compilation resources (e.g. time and space), performance, and functionality. This problem is particularly pronounced when modern compiler optimizations resort to sophisticated and expensive algorithms to aim at high performance computing. Furthermore, it is often beneficial to give priority to optimize the more profitable portions of programs. Earlier works have proposed ways to allow some control on the size and structure of optimization scope. In this paper we develop a new region-based compilation framework driven by the considerations of performance opportunities and compilation resources. In addition, we allow some optimization-directed attributes communicated from one optimization phase to another on a region basis to guide subsequent optimizations. This region-based framework has been implemented in the Open Research Compiler targeting Itanium Processor Family (IPF). Experimental results from the SPEC2000Int programs show that this infrastructure provides an effective control on forming regions to meet the requirements of different optimizations. For example, the compilation time of instruction scheduling is significantly reduced by this region formation infrastructure while preserving or improving the overall performance. At the highest optimization level, the performance of one program has a 15.6% improvement by employing this region-based infrastructure.  2003 IEEE. .

2003-01-01 - A statistical adaptive block-matching motion estimation

Article:
In this paper, we address the problem of motion estimation (ME) in digital video sequences and propose a new fast, adaptive, and efficient block-matching algorithm. Higher quality and efficiency are achieved using a statistical model for the motion vectors. This model introduces adaptation in the search window, drastically reducing the number of positions where correlation-type computation is performed. The efficiency is further improved by progressively undersampling the macroblock. Patterns for undersampling are proposed to obtain the maximum benefit from single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions. In contrast with existing motion-estimation techniques, search strategy and subsampled patterns are closely linked. This shows that a good search strategy is much more important than blindly reducing the number of pixels considered for the matching pattern. We describe an implementation of the proposed matching strategy that exploits the very long instruction word (VLIW) and SIMD technology available in the new Itanium Processor Family. Results show that the proposed algorithm adapts easily to the evolution of the scene avoiding annoying quality drops that can be observed with other deterministic algorithms. The total number of operations required by the proposed method is inferior to those required by traditional approaches. .

2003-01-01 - Analyzing the Intel Itanium memory ordering rules using logic programming and SAT

Article:
We present a non-operational approach to specifying and analyzing shared memory consistency models. The method uses higher order logic to capture a complete set of ordering constraints on execution traces, in an axiomatic style. A direct encoding of the semantics with a constraint logic programming language provides an interactive and incremental framework for exercising and verifying finite test programs. The framework has also been adapted to generate equivalent boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. These techniques make a memory model specification executable, a powerful feature lacked in most non-operational methods. As an example, we provide a concise formalization of the Intel Itanium memory model and show how constraint solving and SAT solving can be effectively applied for computer aided analysis. Encouraging initial results demonstrate the scalability for complex industrial designs.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003. .

2003-01-01 - Compiler optimization-space exploration

Article:
To meet the demands of modern architectures, optimizing compilers must incorporate an ever larger number of increasingly complex transformation algorithms. Since code transformations may often degrade performance or interfere with subsequent transformations, compilers employ predictive heuristics to guide optimizations by predicting their effects a priori. Unfortunately, the unpredictability of optimization interaction and the irregularity of today's wide-issue machines severely limit the accuracy of these heuristics. As a result, compiler writers may temper high variance optimizations with overly conservative heuristics or may exclude these optimizations entirely. While this process results in a compiler capable of generating good average code quality across the target benchmark set, it is at the cost of missed optimization opportunities in individual code segments. To replace predictive heuristics, researchers have proposed compilers which explore many optimization options, selecting the best one a posteriori. Unfortunately, these existing iterative compilation techniques are not practical for reasons of compile time and applicability. We present the Optimization-Space Exploration (OSE) compiler organization, the first practical iterative compilation strategy applicable to optimizations in general-purpose compilers. Instead of replacing predictive heuristics, OSE uses the compiler writer's knowledge encoded in the heuristics to select a small number of promising optimization alternatives for a given code segment. Compile time is limited by evaluating only these alternatives for hot code segments using a general compile-time performance estimator An OSE-enhanced version of Intel's highly-tuned, aggressively optimizing production compiler for IA-64 yields a significant performance improvement, more than 20% in some cases, on Itanium for SPEC codes.  2003 IEEE. .

2003-01-01 - Data Remapping for Design Space Optimization of Embedded Memory Systems

Article:
In this article, we present a novel linear time algorithm for data remapping, that is, (i) lightweight; (ii) fully automated; and (iii) applicable in the context of pointer-centric programming languages with dynamic memory allocation support. All previous work in this area lacks one or more of these features.We proceed to demonstrate a novel application of this algorithm as a key step in optimizing the design of an embedded memory system. Specifically, we show that by virtue of locality enhancements via data remapping, we may reduce the memory subsystem needs of an application by 50%, and hence concomitantly reduce the associated costs in terms of size, power, and dollar-investment (61%). Such a reduction overcomes key hurdles in designing high-performance embedded computing solutions. Namely, memory subsystems are very desirable from a performance standpoint, but their costs have often limited their use in embedded systems. Thus, our innovative approach offers the intriguing possibility of compilers playing a significant role in exploring and optimizing the design space of a memory subsystem for an embedded design. To this end and in order to properly leverage the improvements afforded by a compiler optimization, we identify a range of measures for quantifying the cost-impact of popular notions of locality, prefetching, regularity of memory access, and others. The proposed methodology will become increasingly important, especially as the needs for application specific embedded architectures become prevalent. In addition, we demonstrate the wide applicability of data remapping using several existing microprocessors, such as the Pentium and UltraSparc. Namely, we show that remapping can achieve a performance improvement of 20% on the average. Similarly, for a parametric research HPL-PD microprocessor, which characterizes the new Itanium machines, we achieve a performance improvement of 28% on average. All of our results are achieved using applications from the DIS, Olden and SPEC2000 suites of integer and floating point benchmarks. Copyright  2003, ACM. All rights reserved. . Keywords:;

2003-01-01 - Efficient resource management during instruction scheduling for the EPIC architectures

Article:
Effective and efficient modelling and management of hardware resources have always been critical toward generating highly efficient code in optimizing compilers. The instruction templates and dispersal rules of the EPIC architecture add new complexity in managing resource constraints to instruction scheduler. We extended a finite state automaton (FSA) approach to efficiently manage all key resource constraints of an EPIC architecture on-the-fly during instruction scheduling. We have fully integrated the FSA-based resource management into the instruction scheduler in the Open Research Compiler for the EPIC architecture. Our integrated approach shows up to 12% speedup on some SPECint2000 benchmarks and 4.5% speedup on average for all SPECint2000 benchmarks on an Itanium machine when compares to an instruction scheduler with decoupled resource management. In the meantime, the instruction scheduling time of our approach is reduced by 4% on average.  2003 IEEE. .

2003-01-01 - Eliminating exception constraints of java programs for IA-64

Article:
Java exception checks are designed to ensure that any faulting instruction causing a hardware exception does not terminate the program abnormally. These checks, however, impose some constraints upon the execution order between an instruction potentially raising a Java exception and a faulting instruction causing a hardware exception. This reduces the effectiveness of instruction reordering optimizations for Java programs. Although some effective techniques have been proposed to eliminate exception checks, many exception checks still remain. We propose a new framework to perform speculation effectively for Java programs using a direct acyclic graph representation (DAG) based on the SSA form. Using this framework, we apply a well-known speculation technique to a faulting load instruction to eliminate such constraints. We use edges to represent exception constraints. This allows us to estimate the potential reduction of the critical path length accurately for applying speculation. The new framework also allows us to avoid extra copy instructions and to generate efficient code with minimum register pressure. We have implemented it in the IBM Java Just-In-Time compiler, and observed performance improvements of 30% for one of the micro-benchmark programs, up to 13% (with an average of 1.7%) for the Java Grande Benchmark Suite, and up to 12% (with an average of 1.2%) for SPECjvm98 on an Itanium processor. Our speculation technique was particularly effective for those programs that access multidimensional arrays. .

The Intel Itanium architecture is increasingly becoming one of the major processor architectures present in the market today. Launched in 2001, the Intel Itanium processor was followed in 2002 by the Itanium 2 processor, with increased integer and floating-point performance. Measured by the SPEC CINT2000 benchmarks, the Itanium 2 processor still trails by about 25% the Intel P4 processor in integer performance, albeit P4 runs at more than three times Itanium's clock frequency. However, its floating-point performance clearly leads in the SPEC CFP2000 charts, and its rating is about 25% higher than that of the P4 processor. While the general features of the Itanium architecture such as large register sets, predication, speculation, and support for explicit parallelism 1 have been presented in several papers, books, and mainstream college textbooks 2, its floating-point architecture has been less publicized. Two books, 3 and 4, cover well this area.

Title:
2003-01-01 - Inter-Procedural Stacked Register Allocation for Itanium Like Architecture

Article:
A hardware managed register stack, Register Stack Engine (RSE), is implemented in Itanium architecture to provide a unified and flexible register structure to software. The compiler allocates each procedure a register stack frame with its size explicitly specified using an alloc instruction. When the total number of registers used by the procedures on the call stack exceeds the number of physical registers, RSE performs automatically register overflows and fills to ensure that the current procedure has its requested registers available. The virtual register stack frames and RSE alleviate the need of explicit spills by the compiler, but our experimental results indicate that a trade-off exists between using stacked registers and explicit spills under high register pressure due to the uneven cost between them. In this work, we introduce the stacked register quota assignment problem based on the observation that reducing stacked register usage in some procedures could reduce the total memory access time of spilling registers, which includes the time caused by the loads/stores due to explicit register spills and RSE overflows/fills. We propose a new inter-procedural algorithm to solve the problem by allocating stacked registers across procedures based on a quantitative cost model. The results show that our approach can improve performance significantly for the programs with high RSE overflow cost, e.g. perlbmk and crafty, improved by 14% and 3.7%, respectively. .

2003-01-01 - Optimization for the Intel Itanium architecture register stack

Article:
The Intel Itanium architecture contains a number of innovative compiler-controllable features designed to exploit instruction level parallelism. New code generation and optimization techniques are critical to the application of these features to improve processor performance. For instance, the Itanium architecture provides a compiler-controllable virtual register stack to reduce the penalty of memory accesses associated with procedure calls. The Itanium Register Stack Engine (RSE) transparently manages the register stack and saves and restores physical registers to and from memory as needed. Existing code generation techniques for the register stack aggressively allocate virtual registers without regard to the register pressure on different control-flow paths. As such, applications with large data sets may stress the RSE, and cause substantial execution delays due to the high number of register saves and restores. Since the Itanium architecture is developed around Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) concepts, solutions to increasing the register stack efficiency favor code generation techniques rather than hardware approaches.  2003 IEEE. .

A blocking method is a popular optimization technique for sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMxV). In this paper, a new blocking method which generalizes the conventional two blocking methods and its application to the parallel environment are proposed. This paper also proposes a dynamic parameter selection method for blocked parallel SpMxV which automatically selects the parameter set according to the characteristics of the target matrix and machine in order to achieve high performance on various computational environments. The performance with dynamically selected parameter set is compared with the performance with generally-used fixed parameter sets for 12 types of sparse matrices on four parallel machines: including PentiumIII, Sparc II, MIPS R12000 and Itanium. The result shows that the performance with dynamically selected parameter set is the best in most cases.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003. .

2003-01-01 - Performance potentials of compiler-directed data speculation

Article:
Compiler-directed data speculation has been implemented on Itanium systems to allow for a compiler to move a load across a store even when the two operations are potentially aliased This not only breaks data dependency to reduce critical path length, but also allows a load to be scheduled far apart from its uses to hide cache miss latencies. However, the effectiveness of data speculation is affected by the sophistication of alias analysis technique as well as the aggressiveness of the instruction scheduler. In general, the more sophisticated is the alias analysis technique, the less performance gain is from data speculation, and the more aggressive is the instruction scheduler, the more opportunity is for data speculation. In this paper we evaluate in various scenarios the performance potentials of data speculation for SPEC2000C benchmarks. For each scenario, we determine the performance contributions of data speculation due to both critical path reduction and cache miss latency reduction. We also show interesting statistics about the effects of scheduling constraints, the percentage of critical dependencies, the impacts of cache miss latencies, and the distances between the load locations before and after data speculation.  2003 IEEE. .

## Analysis of the Article's Sentiment Towards Itanium:

The article focuses on the implementation of **compiler-directed data speculation** on Itanium systems.  It aims to evaluate the **performance potentials of this technique** by examining its impact on SPEC2000C benchmarks. 

The article describes how data speculation helps to improve performance in two ways:

1. **Reduces critical path length:** By moving a load across a store, even when they might be aliased, data dependency is broken, which can significantly shorten the critical path of execution.
2. **Hides cache miss latencies:**  Moving the load further away from its uses allows for better scheduling, potentially hiding the latency associated with cache misses.

However, the article also acknowledges that the effectiveness of data speculation is influenced by:

* **Sophistication of alias analysis:** More sophisticated analysis leads to fewer opportunities for speculation, as it can more accurately identify potential aliasing.
* **Aggressiveness of instruction scheduler:** A more aggressive scheduler can utilize data speculation more effectively.

While the article mentions Itanium specifically in the context of data speculation implementation, it doesn't directly express positive or negative sentiments towards the architecture itself. Instead, it focuses on the **performance implications of the data speculation technique** and its impact on the execution of SPEC2000C benchmarks. 

**Overall Sentiment:** The article remains **neutral** towards Itanium. It uses the architecture as a platform for analyzing the performance benefits of data speculation, without directly commenting on its strengths or weaknesses.

2003-01-01 - Procedure cloning and integration for converting parallelism from coarse to fine grain

Article:
This paper introduces a method for improving program run-time performance by gathering work in an application and executing it efficiently in an integrated thread. Our methods extend whole-program optimization by expanding the scope of the compiler through a combination of software thread integration and procedure cloning. In each experiment we integrate a frequently executed procedure with itself twice or thrice, creating two clones. Then, based on profile data we select at compile time the fastest version (original or clone) and modify call sites as needed.

## Analyzing the Sentiment towards Itanium

This article focuses on **improving program run-time performance** by using a technique called **procedure cloning and integration**. The core idea is to create multiple versions of frequently executed procedures (clones), optimize them for different execution scenarios, and then dynamically choose the fastest version at runtime. 

The article **demonstrates** this technique by applying it to three procedures within the cjpeg and djpeg programs, which are then compiled with **four different compilers** for the **Itanium EPIC architecture**. The authors then measure the performance using the **on-chip performance measurement units** to assess the effectiveness of their technique.

**Regarding Itanium, the article doesn't explicitly express a strong positive or negative sentiment.** It uses Itanium as a **target platform** for their performance analysis. They mention using **four different compilers** for the Itanium architecture, implying that it was a common platform for experimentation at the time. The **on-chip performance measurement units** are also mentioned, suggesting that Itanium provided adequate tools for performance analysis.

**However, the article does mention that cjpeg, one of the programs tested, "is not significantly constrained by the i-cache".** This statement **could be interpreted as a subtle critique**, implying that the i-cache might be a potential bottleneck on the Itanium architecture. 

**Overall, the sentiment towards Itanium is neutral to slightly negative.** While the authors utilize Itanium as a platform for demonstrating their technique, they don't explicitly endorse it. The i-cache comment hints at a potential limitation, contributing to a slightly negative sentiment.

**Sentiment Score: [0]** (Neutral)

2003-01-01 - Region-based compilation framework

Article:
The traditional framework for back-end compilation is based on the scope of functions, which is a convenient way to partition an entire application program. However, the sizes and structures of functions may not be the best scope for program analysis and transformations when considering compilation resources (such as time and memory usage), performance, and functionality. This problem is particularly critical when the modern compilers resort to sophisticated and expensive algorithms to exploit instruction-level parallelism. When a function has a large size, an expensive algorithm based on the function scope often makes the usage of compilation time and space usage unacceptable. Some earlier work proposed a compilation framework to allow some control on the size and structure of an optimization scope. This paper proposes a new region-based compilation framework driven by the considerations of compilation resources and performance opportunities. And some optimization-directed attributes can be passed and observed from optimization phase to phase on a region basis. This region-based framework is being implemented in a compiler ORC (Open Research Compiler) targeting at the Itanium Processor Family (IPF). .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article:

**Topic and Goal:**

This article focuses on the limitations of traditional function-based compilation frameworks when dealing with complex optimization strategies, particularly for instruction-level parallelism. The author proposes a novel "region-based" compilation framework, where optimization scopes are defined more flexibly than function boundaries. This framework is designed to improve resource utilization, performance, and potentially facilitate more sophisticated optimization techniques.

**Mentioning Itanium:**

The article mentions Itanium only briefly, stating that the region-based framework is being implemented in a compiler called ORC (Open Research Compiler) specifically "targeting at the Itanium Processor Family (IPF)". 

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

While the article doesn't explicitly express positive or negative sentiment towards Itanium, the fact that the region-based framework is being implemented in a compiler targeting Itanium suggests **indirect support**.  Itanium is considered the target architecture for this specific compiler, implying that it's the platform the researchers believe will benefit from the new framework. 

**Sentiment Score:**

Given the context, we can assign a **[1] - Somewhat positive** score. The article doesn't explicitly praise Itanium, but the fact that it is the chosen target architecture for the new compiler hints at a positive view of its potential.

2003-01-01 - The fallacy of spec-based design

Article:
The architectural reference model, a critical tool in microprocessor validation, serves as a gold standard against which a microprocessor is compared. As all validation is performed using it, the reference model must be timely, extensible beyond the original specification, customizable for specific usage models, and, most importantly, functionally flawless. Ideally, we would like a specification-based design flow that transforms the published English language specifications into compilable code that is directly incorporated into the reference model without loss of information or accuracy. At Intel, we have developed and implemented such a flow to create the Itanium&#174; Processor Family&#39;s (IPF) reference model, which is used to validate all IPF processors. In this paper, we describe the benefits and limitations of this process and discuss the practical implications of specification-based design.  2003 IEEE. .

2003-01-01 - The performance of runtime data cache prefetching in a dynamic optimization system

Article:
Traditional software controlled data cache prefetching is often ineffective due to the lack of runtime cache miss and miss address information. To overcome this limitation, we implement runtime data cache prefetching in the dynamic optimization system ADORE (ADaptive Object code Reoptimization). Its performance has been compared with static software prefetching on the SPEC2000 benchmark suite. Runtime cache prefetching shows better performance. On an Itanium 2 based Linux workstation, it can increase performance by more than 20% over static prefetching on some benchmarks. For benchmarks that do not benefit from prefetching, the runtime optimization system adds only 1%-2% overhead. We have also collected cache miss profiles to guide static data cache prefetching in the ORC compiler. With that information the compiler can effectively avoid generating prefetches for loops that hit well in the data cache.  2003 IEEE. .

2003-01-01 - Unspeculation

Article:
Modern architectures, such as the Intel Itanium, support speculation, a hardware mechanism that allows the early execution of expensive operations-possibly even before it is known whether the results of the operation are needed. While such speculative execution can improve execution performance considerably, it requires a significant amount of complex support code to deal with and recover from speculation failures. This greatly complicates the tasks of understanding and re-engineering speculative code. This paper describes a technique for removing speculative instructions from optimized binary programs in a way that is guaranteed to preserve program semantics, thereby making the resulting unspeculated programs easier to understand and more amenable to re-engineering using traditional reverse engineering techniques.  2003 IEEE .

2004-01-01 - A compiler framework for recovery code generation in general speculative optimizations

Article:
A general framework that integrates both control and data speculation using alias profiling and/or compiler heuristic rules has shown to improve SPEC2000 performance on Itanium systems. However, speculative optimizations require check instructions and recovery code to ensure correct execution when speculation fails at runtime. How to generate check instructions and their associated recovery code efficiently and effectively is an issue yet to be well studied. Also, it is very important that the recovery code generated in the earlier phases integrate gracefully in the later optimization phases. At the very least, it should not hinder later optimizations, thus, ensuring overall performance improvement. This paper proposes a framework that uses an if-block structure to facilitate check instructions and recovery code generation for general speculative optimizations. It allows speculative instructions and their recovery code generated in the early compiler optimization phases to be integrated effectively with the subsequent optimization phases. It also allows multi-level speculation for multi-level pointers and multi-level expression trees to be handled with no additional complexity. The proposed recovery code generation framework has been implemented in the Open Research Compiler (ORC). .

2004-01-01 - A multi-platform Co-array Fortran compiler

Article:
Co-array Fortran (CAF) - a small set of extensions to Fortran 90 - is an emerging model for scalable, global address space parallel programming. CAF's global address space programming model simplifies the development of single-program-multiple-data parallel programs by shifting the burden for managing the details of communication from developers to compilers. This paper describes cafe - a prototype implementation of an open-source, multiplatform CAF compiler that generates code well-suited for today's commodity clusters. The cafc compiler translates CAF into Fortran 90 plus calls to one-sided communication primitives. The paper describes key details of cafc's approach to generating efficient code for multiple platforms. Experiments compare the performance of CAF and MPI versions of several NAS parallel benchmarks on an Alpha cluster with a Quadrics interconnect, an Itanium 2 cluster with a Myrinet 2000 interconnect and an Itanium 2 cluster with a Quadrics interconnect. These experiments show that cafc compiles CAF programs into code that delivers performance roughly equal to that of hand-optimized MPI programs. .

2004-01-01 - A real time MPEG-4 parallel encoder on software distributed shared memory systems

Article:
This paper is dedicated to developing a real-time MEPG-4 parallel encoder on software distributed shared memory systems. Basically, the performance of a MPEG-4 parallel encoder implemented on distributed systems is mainly determined by the latency of data synchronization and disk I/O, and the cost of data computation. For reducing the impact of data synchronization latency, we invent a pipeline algorithm to minimize the number of data synchronization points necessary for video encoding. In addition, we employ a master-slave node structure to overlay computation and I/O in order for alleviating the impact of I/O latency. On the other hand, we propose a two-level partitioning method to minimize the cost of data computation, and overlap the encoding times of two different GOVs. We have implemented the proposed MPEG-4 encoder on a test bed called Teamster. The experimental results show the proposed MPEG-4 encoder has successfully met the requirement of real time through the support of previous techniques via 32 SMP machines, which are equipped with dual 1.5 GHz Itanium II processors per node and connected by Gigabit Ethernet.

2004-01-01 - An empirical performance analysis of commodity memories in commodity servers

Article:
This work details a performance study of six different types of commodity memories in two commodity server nodes. A number of micro-benchmarks are used that measure low-level performance characteristics, as well as two applications representative of the ASC workload. The memories vary both in terms of performance, including latency and bandwidths, and in terms of their physical properties and manufacturer. The two server nodes analyzed were an Itanium-II Madison based system, and a Xeon based system. All memories can be used within both of these processing nodes. This allows the performance of the memories to be directly examined while keeping all other factors within a node the same (processor, motherboard, operating system etc.). The results of this study show that there can be a significant difference in application performance depending on the actual memory used - by as much as 20%. The achieved performance is a result of the integration of the memory into the node as well as how the applications actually utilize it. Copyright 2004 ACM. .

2004-01-01 - Applications of storage mapping optimization to register promotion

Article:
Storage mapping optimization is a flexible approach to folding array dimensions in numerical codes. It is designed to reduce the memory footprint after a wide spectrum of loop transformations, whether based on uniform dependence vectors or more expressive polyhedral abstractions. Conversely, few loop transformations have been proposed to facilitate register promotion, namely loop fusion, unroll-and-jam or tiling. Building on array data-flow analysis and expansion, we extend storage mapping optimization to improve opportunities for register promotion. Our work is motivated by the empirical study of a computational biology benchmark, the approximate string matching algorithm BPR from NR-grep, on a wide issue micro-architecture. Our experiments confirm the major benefit of register tiling (even on non-numerical benchmarks) but also shed the light on two novel issues: prior array expansion may be necessary to enable loop transformations that finally authorize profitable register promotion, and more advanced scheduling techniques (beyond tiling and unrolland-jam) may significantly improve performance in fine-tuning register usage and instruction-level parallelism. .

2004-01-01 - Applying MPI derived datatypes to the NAS benchmarks: A case study

Article:
MPI derived datatypes are a powerful method to define arbitrary collections of non-contiguous data in memory and to enable non-contiguous data communication in a single MPI function call. In this paper, we employ MPI datatypes in four NAS benchmarks (MG, LU, BT, and SP) to transfer non-contiguous data. Comprehensive performance evaluation was carried out on two clusters: an Itanium-2 Myrinet cluster and a Xeon InfiniBand cluster. Performance results show that using datatypes can achieve performance comparable to manual packing/unpacking in the original benchmarks, though the MPI implementations that were studied also perform internal packing and unpacking on non-contiguous datatype communication. In some cases, better performance can be achieved because of the reduced costs to transfer non-contiguous data. This is because some optimizations in the MPI packing/unpacking implementations can be easily overlooked in manual packing and unpacking by users. Our case study demonstrates that MPI datatypes simplify the implementation of non-contiguous communication and lead to application code with portable performance. We expect that with further improvement of datatype processing and datatype communication such as, datatypes can outperform the conventional methods of noncontiguous data communication. Our modified NAS benchmarks can be used to evaluate datatype processing and datatype communication in MPI implementations. .

Article:
Co-array Fortran (CAF) is an emerging model for scalable, global address space parallel programming that consists of a small set of extensions to the Fortran 90 programming language. Compared to MPI, the widely-used message-passing programming model, CAF's global address space programming model simplifies the development of single-program-multiple-data parallel programs by shifting the burden for choreographing and optimizing communication from developers to compilers. This paper describes an open-source, portable, and retargetable CAP compiler under development at Rice University that is well-suited for today's high-performance clusters. Our compiler translates CAF into Fortran 90 plus calls to one-sided communication primitives. Preliminary experiments comparing CAF and MPI versions of several of the NAS parallel benchmarks on an Itanium 2 cluster with a Myrinet 2000 interconnect show that our CAF compiler delivers performance that is roughly equal to or, in many cases, better than that of programs parallelized using MPI, even though support for global optimization of communication has not yet been implemented in our compiler.

2004-01-01 - Compiler orchestrated prefetching via speculation and predication

Article:
This paper introduces a compiler-orchestrated prefetching system as a unified framework geared toward ameliorating the gap between processing speeds and memory access latencies. We focus the scope of the optimization on specific subsets of the program dependence graph that succinctly characterize the memory access pattern of both regular array-based applications and irregular pointer-intensive programs. We illustrate how program embedded precomputation via speculative execution can accurately predict and effectively prefetch future memory references with negligible overhead. The proposed techniques reduce the total running time of seven SPEC benchmarks and two OLDEN benchmarks by 27% on an Itanium 2 processor. The improvements are in addition to several state-of-the-art optimizations including software pipelining and data prefetching. In addition, we use cycle-accurate simulations to identify important and lightweight architectural innovations that further mitigate the memory system bottleneck. In particular, we focus on the notoriously challenging class of pointer-chasing applications, and demonstrate how they may benefit from a novel scheme of sentineled prefetching. Our results for twelve SPEC benchmarks demonstrate that 45% of the processor stalls that are caused by the memory system are avoidable. The techniques in this paper can effectively mask long memory latencies with little instruction overhead, and can readily contribute to the performance of processors today. Copyright 2004 ACM. .

2004-01-01 - Compiler-assisted cache replacement: Problem formulation and performance evaluation

Article:
Recent research results show that conventional hardware-only cache solutions result in unsatisfactory cache utilization for both regular and irregular applications. To overcome this problem, a number of architectures introduce instruction hints to assist cache replacement. For example, Intel Itanium architecture augments memory accessing instructions with cache hints to distinguish data that will be referenced in the near future from the rest. With the availability of such methods, the performance of the underlying cache architecture critically depends on the ability of the compiler to generate code with appropriate cache hints. In this paper we formulate this problem - giving cache hints to memory instructions such that cache miss rate is minimized - as a 0/1 knapsack problem, which can be efficiently solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. The proposed approach has been implemented in our compiler testbed and evaluated on a set of scientific computing benchmarks. Initial results show that our approach is effective on reducing the cache miss rate and improving program performance.  Springer-Verlag; 2004. .

## Analyzing the Sentiment towards Itanium:

The article focuses on the problem of inefficient cache utilization in both regular and irregular applications. It highlights the limitations of hardware-only cache solutions and introduces the concept of compiler-assisted cache replacement. This approach leverages "instruction hints" to guide the cache replacement process, effectively optimizing cache performance.

The article specifically mentions the Intel Itanium architecture as an example of such a system. It states that Itanium "augments memory accessing instructions with cache hints" to differentiate between data that will be used shortly and the rest. This suggests that Itanium is a system that utilizes compiler-assisted cache replacement.

However, the article focuses on the general problem of compiler-assisted cache replacement and proposes a solution using a 0/1 knapsack problem. It does not explicitly praise or criticize Itanium's implementation. The mention of Itanium is merely used as an example to illustrate the potential of compiler-assisted cache replacement.

Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium can be considered neutral. The article acknowledges its existence and its utilization of compiler-assisted techniques, but it does not express any explicit positive or negative opinions about Itanium itself.

2004-01-01 - Construction and performance characterization of parallel interior point solver on 4-way intel Itanium 2 multiprocessor system

Article:
In recent years the interior point method (IPM) has became a dominant choice for solving large convex optimization problems for many scientific, engineering and commercial applications. Two reasons for the success of the IPM are its good scalability on existing multiprocessor systems with a small number of processors and its potential to deliver a scalable performance on systems with a large number of processors. The scalability of a parallel IPM is determined by several key issues such as exploiting parallelism due to sparsity of the problem, reducing communication overhead and proper load balancing. In this paper we present an implementation of a parallel linear programming IPM workload and characterize its scalability on a 4-way Itanium 2 system. We show a speedup of up to 3-times for some of the datasets. We also present a detailed micro-architectural analysis of the workload using VTune  performance analyzer. Our results suggest that a good IPM implementation is latency-bound. Based on these findings, we make suggestions on how to improve the performance of the IPM workload in the future.  2004 IEEE. .

2004-01-01 - Data dependence profiling for speculative optimizations

Article:
Data dependence analysis is the foundation to many reordering related compiler optimizations and loop parallelization. Traditional data dependence analysis algorithms are developed primarily for Fortran-like subscripted array variables. They are not very effective for pointer-based references in C or C++. With more advanced hardware support for speculative execution, such as the advanced load instructions in Intel's IA64 architecture, some data dependences with low probability can be speculatively ignored. However, such speculative optimizations must be carefully applied to avoid excessive cost associated with potential mis-speculations. Data dependence profiling is one way to provide probabilistic information on data dependences to guide such speculative optimizations and speculative thread generation. Software-based data dependence profiling requires detailed tracing of memory accesses, therefore, could be very time consuming. In this paper, we examine issues related to data dependence profiling, and propose various techniques to improve the efficiency of data dependence profiling. We use the Open Research Compiler (ORC) [15,16] to test the efficiency of our data profiling techniques. We also study the effectiveness of data dependence profiling on data speculative optimizations on Itanium systems. Our results show that efficient data dependence profiling could improve the performance for data speculative optimizations.  Springer-Verlag 2004. .

2004-01-01 - Digital tomosynthesis mammography using a parallel maximum likelihood reconstruction method

Article:
A parallel reconstruction method, based on an iterative maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm, is developed to provide fast reconstruction for digital tomosynthesis mammography. Tomosynthesis mammography acquires 11 low-dose projections of a breast by moving an x-ray tube over a 50 angular range. In parallel reconstruction, each projection is divided into multiple segments along the chest-to-nipple direction. Using the 11 projections, segments located at the same distance from the chest wall are combined to compute a partial reconstruction of the total breast volume. The shape of the partial reconstruction forms a thin slab, angled toward the x-ray source at a projection angle 0. The reconstruction of the total breast volume is obtained by merging the partial reconstructions. The overlap region between neighboring partial reconstructions and neighboring projection segments is utilized to compensate for the incomplete data at the boundary locations present in the partial reconstructions. A serial execution of the reconstruction is compared to a parallel implementation, using clinical data. The serial code was run on a PC with a single PentiumIV 2.2GHz CPU. The parallel implementation was developed using MPI and run on a 64-node Linux cluster using 800MHz Itanium CPUs. The serial reconstruction for a medium-sized breast (5cm thickness, 11cm chest-to-nipple distance) takes 115 minutes, while a parallel implementation takes only 3.5 minutes. The reconstruction time for a larger breast using a serial implementation takes 187 minutes, while a parallel implementation takes 6.5 minutes. No significant differences were observed between the reconstructions produced by the serial and parallel implementations. .

## Analyzing the Sentiment Towards Itanium

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on a novel parallel reconstruction method for digital tomosynthesis mammography, aiming to significantly speed up the reconstruction process. The core idea is to divide the breast volume into segments and reconstruct each segment independently using multiple low-dose x-ray projections. The authors then compare the performance of a serial reconstruction implementation (run on a single CPU) against a parallel implementation using MPI (run on a 64-node Linux cluster with Itanium CPUs).

**Sentiment Towards Itanium:**

The article does not express any specific opinions or sentiments about the Itanium processor itself. It simply uses Itanium as the hardware platform for its parallel implementation, focusing primarily on comparing the performance of the parallel approach with the serial approach. 

**The authors:**

* **Do not criticize Itanium:**  They do not mention any negative aspects or limitations of the Itanium architecture.
* **Do not explicitly praise Itanium:**  They do not highlight any specific advantages or benefits of using Itanium for their task. 
* **Focus on the performance difference:**  The primary emphasis is on the dramatic reduction in reconstruction time achieved with the parallel implementation, regardless of the underlying processor architecture.

**Conclusion:**

The article uses Itanium as a tool to demonstrate the benefits of parallel processing for mammography reconstruction. However, it offers no explicit opinions or sentiments regarding the processor itself. Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium is neutral.

**Sentiment Score: [0] - Neutral**

2004-01-01 - Early performance results on the NRL SGI Altix 3000 computer

Article:
Since December 2002 the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has been evaluating an Altix 3000, the newest high performance computing system available from Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI). The Altix is a departure from the previous products from SGI in that instead of using MIPS processors and the IRIX operating system, the Altix uses the Intel Itanium IA-64 processor and SGI ProPack (based on Linux Red Hat) operating system. The Altix still has the brick concept of system configuration and the SGI NUMAlink for the inter-module network for the shared memory. The Altix runs under a single image of the operating system and supports parallel programming through OpenMP, MPI, CoArray, FORTRAN, and an automatic parallelizing compiler. Various codes have been evaluated with respect to their ease of portability and their performance on the Altix as compared to other high performance computers. .

2004-01-01 - Efficient data driven run-time code generation

Article:
Knowledge of data values at run-time allows us to generate better code in terms of eficiency, size and power consumption. This paper introduces a low-level compiling technique based on a minimal code generator with parametric embedded sections to generate binary code at run-time. This generator called a "compilet" creates code and allocates registers using the data input. Then, it generates the needed instructions. Our measurements, performed on Itanium 2 and PowerPC platforms have shown a speed improvement of 43% on the Itanium 2 platform and 41% on the PowerPC one. The proposed technique proves to be particularly useful in the case of intensively reused functions in graphic applications, where the advantages of dynamic compilation have not been fully taken into account yet. .

## Analysis of the Article's Sentiment Towards Itanium:

The article focuses on **formal verification of pipelined processors**, particularly those with long instruction queues. It presents a novel method to simplify this complex process by verifying the execution and fetch engines separately.  The key takeaway is that this approach significantly improves verification efficiency, allowing for the analysis of processors with much larger instruction queues.

The article mentions **Intel Itanium** as an example of a processor that inspired the development of the verification method. The authors state they tested their method on a **"9-stage, 9-wide VLIW processor"** which implements **"many realistic and speculative features inspired by the Intel Itanium."**

However, the article explicitly highlights the **limitations of previous verification methods** when dealing with larger instruction queues:

* "...ran out of memory if the instruction queue was longer" (referring to the monolithic verification approach).

This statement, while not directly criticizing Itanium, implies that **the complexity of processors with long instruction queues, like those found in Itanium, posed significant challenges for traditional verification methods.**

**Therefore, the article doesn't directly praise or condemn Itanium. It uses it as a reference point for the challenges it aims to address.** While it mentions Itanium's features as an inspiration, it ultimately focuses on the limitations of traditional verification techniques and presents a solution to overcome those limitations, which were particularly pronounced in the context of Itanium-like processors.

## Conclusion:

The article's sentiment towards Itanium is **[0] Neutral**.  It doesn't offer a direct opinion on Itanium, but rather uses it as a context to demonstrate the need for improved verification methods, especially when dealing with processors with complex features and long instruction queues.

2004-01-01 - Efficient modeling of Itanium architecture during instruction scheduling using extended finite state automata

Article:
Effective and efficient modeling and management of hardware resources have always been critical toward generating highly efficient code in optimizing compilers. The instruction templates and dispersal rules of the Itanium architecture add new complexity in managing resource constraints to instruction scheduler. We extended a finite state automaton (FSA) approach to efficiently manage all key resource constraints of an Itanium architecture on-the-fly during instruction scheduling. We have fully integrated the FSA-based resource management into the instruction scheduler in the Open Research Compiler for the Itanium architecture. Our integrated approach shows up to 12% speedup on some SPECint2000 benchmarks and 4.5% speedup on average for all SPECint2000 benchmarks on an Itanium-based system when compares to an instruction scheduler with decoupled resource management. In the meantime, the instruction scheduling time of our approach is reduced by 4% on average. .

2004-01-01 - Exploiting free execution slots on EPIC processors for efficient and accurate runtime profiling

Article:
Dynamic optimization relies on runtime profile information to improve the performance of program execution. Traditional profiling techniques incur significant overhead and are not suitable for dynamic optimization. In this paper, we propose a new profiling technique that incorporates the strength of both software and hardware to achieve near-zero overhead profiling. The compiler passes profiling requests as a few bits of information in branch instructions to the hardware, and the hardware uses the free execution slots available in a user program to execute profiling operations. We have implemented the compiler instrumentation of this technique using an Itanium research compiler. Our result shows that the accurate block profiling incurs very little overhead to the user program in terms of the program scheduling cycles. For example, the average overhead is 0.6% for the SPECint95 benchmarks. The hardware support required for the new profiling is practical. We believe this will enable many profile-driven dynamic optimizations for EPIC processors such as the Itanium processors.  Springer-Verlag 2004. .

2004-01-01 - Exploring the performance potential of itanium processors with ILP-based scheduling

Article:
HP and Intel's Itanium Processor Family (IPF) is considered as one of the most challenging processor architectures to generate code for. During global instruction scheduling, the compiler must balance the use of strongly interdependent techniques like code motion, speculation and predication. A too conservative application of these features can lead to empty execution slots, contrary to the EPIC philosophy. But overuse can cause resource shortage which spoils the benefit. We tackle this problem using integer linear programming (ILP), a proven standard optimization method. Our ILP model comprises global, partial-ready code motion with automated generation of compensation code as well as vital IPF features like control / data speculation and predication. The ILP approach can - with some restrictions - resolve the interdependences between these decisions and deliver the global optimum. This promises a speedup for compute-intensive applications as well as some theoretically funded insights into the potential of the architecture. Experiments with several hot functions from the SPEC benchmarks show substantial improvements: Our postpass optimizer reduces the schedule lengths produced by Intel's compiler by about 20-40%. The resulting speedup of these routines is 16% on average. .

2004-01-01 - Field-testing IMPACT EPIC research results in Itanium 2

Article:
Explicitly-Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) provides architectural features, including predication and explicit control speculation, intended to enhance the compiler's ability to expose instruction-level parallelism (ILP) in control-intensive programs. Aggressive structural transformations using these features, though described in the literature, have not yet been fully characterized in complete systems. Using the Intel Itanium 2 microprocessor, the SPECint2000 benchmarks and the IMPACT Compiler for IA-64, a research compiler competitive with the best commercial compilers on the platform, we provide an in situ evaluation of code generated using aggressive, EPIC-enabled techniques in a reality-constrained microarchitecture. Our work shows a 1.13 average speedup (up to 1.50) due to these compilation techniques, relative to traditionally-optimized code at the same inlining and pointer analysis levels, and a 1.55 speedup (up to 2.30) relative to GNU GCC, a solid traditional compiler. Detailed results show that the structural compilation approach provides benefits far beyond a decrease in branch misprediction penalties and that it both positively and negatively impacts instruction cache performance. We also demonstrate the increasing significance of runtime effects, such as data cache and TLB, in determining end performance and the interaction of these effects with control speculation. .

2004-01-01 - Hardware support for prescient instruction prefetch

Article:
This paper proposes and evaluates hardware mechanisms for supporting prescient instruction prefetch - an approach to improving single-threaded application performance by using helper threads to perform instruction prefetch. We demonstrate the need for enabling store-to-load communication and selective instruction execution when directly pre-executing future regions of an application that suffer I-cache misses. Two novel hardware mechanisms, safe-store and YAT-bits, are introduced that help satisfy these requirements. This paper also proposes and evaluates finite state machine recall, a technique for limiting pre-execution to branches that are hard to predict by leveraging a counted I-prefetch mechanism. On a research Itanium SMT processor with next line and streaming I-prefetch mechanisms that incurs latencies representative of next generation processors, prescient instruction prefetch can improve performance by an average of 10.0% to 22% on a set of SPEC 2000 benchmarks that suffer significant I-cache misses. Prescient instruction prefetch is found to be competitive against even the most aggressive research hardware instruction prefetch technique: fetch directed instruction prefetch. .

Instead, the focus is on the effectiveness of the proposed technique, demonstrating how it can improve performance even on a processor with existing prefetching mechanisms. 

The article notes that the Itanium processor used for evaluation has "latencies representative of next generation processors". This implies that the Itanium processor is being used as a platform to explore future hardware trends, rather than being solely evaluated for its own merits. 

**Conclusion:**

The article is primarily focused on the novel "prescient instruction prefetch" technique, using Itanium as a testbed. The article's analysis focuses on the performance gains achieved by this technique, regardless of the processor's underlying architecture. While the article doesn't explicitly criticize or praise Itanium, it positions the processor as a platform for testing future hardware trends.

2004-01-01 - Helper threads via virtual multithreading on an experimental itanium 2 processor-based platform

Article:
Helper threading is a technology to accelerate a program by exploiting a processor's multithreading capability to run "assist" threads. Previous experiments on hyper-threaded processors have demonstrated significant speedups by using helper threads to prefetch hard-to-predict delinquent data accesses. In order to apply this technique to processors that do not have built-in hardware support for multithreading, we introduce virtual multithreading (VMT), a novel form of switch-on-event user-level multithreading, capable of fly-weight multiplexing of event-driven thread executions on a single processor without additional operating system support. The compiler plays a key role in minimizing synchronization cost by judiciously partitioning register usage among the user-level threads. The VMT approach makes it possible to launch dynamic helper thread instances in response to long-latency cache miss events, and to run helper threads in the shadow of cache misses when the main thread would be otherwise stalled. The concept of VMT is prototyped on an Itanium 2 processor using features provided by the Processor Abstraction Layer (PAL) firmware mechanism already present in currently shipping processors. On a 4-way MP physical system equipped with VMT-enabled Itanium 2 processors, helper threading via the VMT mechanism can achieve significant performance gains for a diverse set of real-world workloads, ranging from single-threaded workstation benchmarks to heavily multithreaded large scale decision support systems (DSS) using the IBM DB2 Universal Database. We measure a wall-clock speedup of 5.8% to 38.5% for the workstation benchmarks, and 5.0% to 12.7% on various queries in the DSS workload. .

2004-01-01 - Improving 64-bit Java IPF performance by compressing heap references

Article:
64-bit processor architectures like the Intel Itanium Processor Family are designed for large applications that need large memory addresses. When running applications that fit within a 32-bit address space, 64-bit CPUs are at a disadvantage compared to 32-bit CPUs because of the larger memory footprints for their data. This results in worse cache and TLB utilization, and consequently lower performance because of increased miss ratios. This paper considers software techniques for virtual machines that allow 32-bit pointers to be used on 64-bit CPUs for managed runtime applications that do not need the full 64-bit address space. We describe our pointer compression techniques and discuss our experience implementing these for Java applications. In addition, we give performance results with our techniques for both the SPEC JVM98 and SPEC JBB2000 benchmarks. We demonstrate a 12% performance improvement on SPEC JBB2000 and a reduction in the number of garbage collections required for a given heap size. .

This article focuses on a specific problem faced by 64-bit processors like Itanium when running applications designed for a 32-bit address space. The core issue is that the larger memory footprint of 64-bit processors leads to worse cache and TLB utilization, ultimately resulting in lower performance.

The article doesn't directly criticize Itanium's architecture. Instead, it acknowledges the inherent challenge of running 32-bit applications on a 64-bit platform, and proposes a solution  pointer compression  to mitigate this performance disadvantage.  This approach directly addresses the issue of larger memory footprints and their impact on cache and TLB performance.

While the article highlights the problem, it focuses on presenting a solution, rather than placing blame on the processor architecture itself. The overall tone is more problem-solving than accusatory.  The article even offers positive performance results achieved through pointer compression, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving Itanium's performance for 32-bit applications.

**Therefore, the article exhibits a neutral sentiment towards Itanium, acknowledging its potential limitations in specific scenarios but focusing on offering solutions rather than criticizing the architecture itself.**

2004-01-01 - Improving load/store queues usage in scientific computing

Article:
Memory disambiguation mechanisms, coupled with load/store queues in out-of-order processors, are crucial to increase Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP), especially for memory-bound scientific codes. Designing ideal memory disambiguation mechanisms is too complex because it would require precise address bits comparators; thus, modern microprocessors implement simplified and imprecise ones that perform only partial address comparisons. In this paper, we study the impact of such simplifications on the sustained performance of some real processors such that Alpha 21264, Power 4 and Itanium 2. Despite all the advanced features of these processors, we demonstrate in this article that memory address disambiguation mechanisms can cause significant performance loss. We demonstrate that, even if data are located in low cache levels and enough ILP exist, the performance degradation can be up to 21 times slower if no care is taken on the order of accessing independent memory addresses. Instead of proposing a hardware solution to improve load/store queues, as done in [1, 6, 5, 7, 4], we show that a software (compilation) technique is possible. Such solution is based on the classical (and robust) Id/st vectorization. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of such method on BLAS 1 codes that are representative of vector scientific loops. .

2004-01-01 - Increasing software-pipelined loops in the itanium-like architecture

Article:
The Itanium architecture (IPF) contains features such as register rotation to support efficient software pipelining. One of the drawbacks of software pipelining is its high register requirement, which may lead to failure when registers provided by architecture are insufficient. This paper evaluates the register requirements of software-pipelined loops in Itanium architecture and presents two new methods, which try to reduce static general register requirements in software pipelined loops by either reducing instructions in the loop body or allocating unused rotating registers for variants using static registers. We have implemented our methods in the Open Research Compiler (ORC) targeted for Itanium processors, and experiments show that number of software-pipelined loops in NAS Benchmarks increased. For some benchmarks, the performance is improved by more than 18%.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004. .

2004-01-01 - Integrating formal verification with murcp of distributed cache coherence protocols in FAME multiprocessor system design

Article:
Flexible Architecture for Multiple Environments (FAME) is Bull architecture for large symmetrical multiprocessors based on Intel's Itanium 2 family, which is used in Bull NovaScale servers series. A key point in the development of this distributed shared memory architecture is the definition of its cache coherence protocol. This paper reports experiences and results of integrating formal verification of FAME cache coherence protocol, on 4 successive versions of this architecture. The goal is to find protocol definition bugs (not implementation) in the early phases of the design, focusing on: cache coherency, data integrity and deadlock-freeness properties. We have performed modeling and verification using Murcp tool and language, because of its easiness of use and its efficient state reduction techniques. The analysis of the results shows that this approach is cost-effective, and in spite of the state explosion problem, it has helped us in finding hard-to-simulate protocol bugs, before the implementation is far ahead.

2004-01-01 - Inter-procedural register allocation for RSE optimization

Article:
In Itanium architecture, a hardware managed register stack is introduced, register stack engine (RSE) can change the register stack frame pointers and spill/fill registers automatically. This mechanism can reduce load/store operations of register across call sites efficiently. The number of stacked registers used by a procedure could be specified by alloc instruction explicitly. Traditional intra-procedural register allocation algorithm will allocate max stacked registers required by a procedure but no more than the total number of stack registers. But a high stack register pressure will lead to frequent register stack spill/fill. If this event happens frequently, the performance will be seriously harmed. This paper proposes an innovative algorithm, which could reduce the RSE cost efficiently. This algorithm is already implemented in ORC. Experimental results show that the performance is improved obviously when this algorithm is applied, especially for perlbmk, it has 14% performance improvement and crafty also has 3.2% performance improvement. .

2004-01-01 - Ispike: A post-link optimizer for the IntelItanium architecture

Article:
Ispike is a post-link optimizer developed for the Intel Itanium Processor Family (IPF) processors. The IPF architecture poses both opportunities and challenges to post-link optimizations. IPF offers a rich set of performance counters to collect detailed profile information at a low cost, which is essential to post-link optimization being practical At the same time, the predication and bundling features on IPF make post-link code transformation more challenging than on other architectures. In Ispike, we have implemented optimizations like code layout, instruction prefetching, data layout, and data prefetching that exploit the IPF advantages, and strategies that cope with the IPF-specific challenges. Using SPEC CINT2000 as benchmarks, we show that Ispike improves performance by as much as 40% on the Itanium 2 processor, with average improvement of 8.5% and 9.9% over executables generated by the Intel Electron compiler and by the Gcc compiler, respectively. We also demonstrate that statistical profiles collected via IFF performance counters and complete profiles collected via instrumentation produce equal performance benefit, but the profiling overhead is significantly lower for performance counters. .

2004-01-01 - Multi-level approach for high-precision cache fault isolation - Case study: Itanium II processor low voltage cache yield improvement

Article:
Fault Isolation / Failure Analysis (FI/FA) of increasingly complex embedded memory in microprocessors is becoming more difficult due to process scaling and presence of subtle defects. As physical failure analysis (PFA) is destructive and involves expensive and time-consuming processes, fault diagnosis needs to be as precise as possible to ensure successful physical defect sighting. This paper introduces a cache Fault Isolation methodology that focuses on exhaustive data collection to derive concrete hypothesis of physical fault location and to overcome the existing FA/FI challenges. The methodology involves a novel application of existing DFT techniques in combination with circuit analysis, pattern hacking, defect localization and PFA tools. Some of the techniques, for example pattern modification or circuit simulation, are applied repeatedly in order to obtain higher-level of isolation - from cell/logic level to transistor/gate level, and finally down to physical structure/layer level. This multi-level FI approach is the key to localize the failing area to greater precision, which had proven itself in Intel Itanium II processor yield improvement process. .

2004-01-01 - Optimizing sparse matrix-vector product computations using unroll and jam

Article:
Large-scale scientific applications frequently compute sparse matrix-vector products in their computational core. For this reason, techniques for computing sparse matrix-vector products efficiently on modern architectures are important. In this paper we describe a strategy for improving the performance of sparse matrix-vector product computations using a loop transformation known as unroll-and-jam. We describe a novel sparse matrix representation that enables us to apply this transformation. Our approach is best suited for sparse matrices that have rows with a small number of predictable lengths. This work was motivated by sparse matrices that arise in SAGE, an application from Los Alamos National Laboratory. We evaluate the performance benefits of our approach using sparse matrices produced by SAGE for a pair of sample inputs. We show that our strategy is effective for improving sparse matrix-vector product performance using these matrices on MIPS R12000, Alpha Ev67, IBM Power 3, and Itanium 2 processors. Our measurements show that for this class of sparse matrices, our strategy improves sparse matrix-vector product performance from a low of 41% on MIPS to well over a factor of 2 on Itanium. .

2004-01-01 - Performance modeling of unstructured mesh particle transport computations

Article:
The performance of unstructured mesh applications presents a number of complexities and subtleties that do not arise for dense structured meshes. From a programming point of view, handling an unstructured mesh has an increased complexity to manage the necessary data structures and interactions between mesh-cells. From a performance point of view, there are added difficulties in understanding both the processing time on a single processor and the scaling characteristics. In this work we present a performance model for the calculation of deterministic SN transport on unstructured meshes. It builds upon earlier work that successfully modeled the same calculation on structured meshes. The model captures the key processing characteristics and is parametric using both the system performance data (latency, bandwidth, processing rate etc.) and application data (mesh size etc.) as input. The model is validated on two clusters (an HP AlphaServer and an Itanium-2 system) showing high accuracy.

2004-01-01 - Pinpointing representative portions of large intel itanium programs with dynamic instrumentation

Article:
Detailed modeling of the performance of commercial applications is difficult. The applications can take a very long time to run on real hardware and it is impractical to simulate them to completion on performance models. Furthermore, these applications have complex execution environments that cannot easily be reproduced on a simulator, making porting the applications to simulators difficult. We attack these problems using the well-known SimPoint methodology to find representative portions of an application to simulate, and a dynamic instrumentation framework called Pin to avoid porting altogether. Our system uses dynamic instrumentation instead of simulation to find representative portions -called PinPoints - for simulation. We have developed a toolkit that automatically detects PinPoints, validates whether they are representative using hardware performance counters, and generates traces for large Itanium programs. We compared SimPoint-based selection to random selection of simulation points. We found for 95% of the SPEC2000 programs we tested, the PinPoints prediction was within 8% of the actual whole-program CPI, as opposed to 18% for random selection. We measure the end-to-end error, comparing real hardware to a performance model, and have a simple and efficient methodology to determine the step that introduced the error. Finally, we evaluate the system in the context of multiple configurations of real hardware, commercial applications, and industrial-strength performance models to understand the behavior of a complete and practical workload collection system. We have successfully used our system with many commercial Itanium programs, some running for trillions of instructions, and have used the resulting traces for predicting performance of those applications on future Itanium processors.  2004 IEEE. .

2004-01-01 - Platform-independent cache optimization by pinpointing low-locality reuse

Article:
For many applications, cache misses are the primary performance bottleneck. Even though much research has been performed on automatically optimizing cache behavior at the hardware and the compiler level, many program executions remain dominated by cache misses. Therefore, we propose to let the programmer optimize, who has a better high-level program overview, needed to resolve many cache problems. In order to assist the programmer, a visualization of memory accesses with poor locality is developed. The aim is to indicate causes of cache misses independent of actual cache parameters such as associativity or size. In that way, the programmer is steered towards platform-independent locality optimizations. The visualization was applied to three programs from the SPEC2000 benchmarks. After optimizing the source code based on the visualization, an average speedup of 3.06 was obtained on different platforms with Athlon, Itanium and Alpha processors; indicating the feasibility of platform-independent cache optimizations.

It advocates for programmer-driven optimization based on a deep understanding of program structure, rather than relying solely on hardware and compiler optimizations. To aid programmers, the article proposes a visualization tool that highlights memory accesses with poor locality, independent of specific cache parameters (associativity, size). This approach aims to enable platform-independent optimizations that benefit various architectures, including Itanium.

The article demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to SPEC2000 benchmarks and achieving an average speedup of 3.06 across different platforms, including Athlon, Itanium, and Alpha. This demonstrates the broad applicability of the proposed methodology. 

While the article doesn't explicitly praise or criticize Itanium, it mentions it as one of the platforms where the optimization technique proves successful. This implies that Itanium is not a limiting factor in achieving performance improvements through the proposed method. 

**Conclusion:** The article presents Itanium as a platform that benefits from the proposed platform-independent optimization technique.

2004-01-01 - Prefetch injection based on hardware monitoring and object metadata

Article:
Cache miss stalls hurt performance because of the large gap between memory and processor speeds - for example, the popular server benchmark SPEC JBB2000 spends 45% of its cycles stalled waiting for memory requests on the Itanium 2 processor. Traversing linked data structures causes a large portion of these stalls. Prefetching for linked data structures remains a major challenge because serial data dependencies between elements in a linked data structure preclude the timely materialization of prefetch addresses. This paper presents Mississippi Delta (MS Delta), a novel technique for prefetching linked data structures that closely integrates the hardware performance monitor (HPM), the garbage collector's global view of heap and object layout, the type-level metadata inherent in type-safe programs, and JIT compiler analysis. The garbage collector uses the HPM's data cache miss information to identify cache miss intensive traversal paths through linked data structures, and then discovers regular distances (deltas) between these linked objects. JIT compiler analysis injects prefetch instructions using deltas to materialize prefetch addresses. We have implemented MS Delta in a fully dynamic profile-guided optimization system: the StarJIT dynamic compiler and the ORP Java virtual machine, We demonstrate a 28-29% reduction in stall cycles attributable to the high-latency cache misses targeted by MS Delta and a speedup of 11-14% on the cache miss intensive SPEC JBB2000 benchmark. .

2004-01-01 - QB or not QB: An efficient execution verification tool for memory orderings

Article:
We study the problem of formally verifying shared memory multiprocessor executions against memory consistency models - an important step during post-silicon verification of multiprocessor machines. We employ our previously reported style of writing formal specifications for shared memory models in higher order logic (HOL), obtaining intuitive as well as modular specifications. Our specification consists of a conjunction of rules that constrain the global visibility order. Given an execution to be checked, our algorithm generates Boolean constraints that capture the conditions under which the execution is legal under the visibility order. We initially took the approach of specializing the memory model HOL axioms into equivalent (for the execution to be checked) quantified boolean formulae (QBF). As this technique proved inefficient, we took the alternative approach of converting the HOL axioms into a program that generates a SAT instance when run on an execution. In effect, the quantifications in our memory model specification were realized as iterations in the program. The generated Boolean constraints are satisfiable if and only if the given execution is legal under the memory model. We evaluate two different approaches to encode the Boolean constraints, and also incremental techniques to generate and solve Boolean constraints. Key results include a demonstration that we can handle executions of realistic lengths for the modern Intel Itanium memory model. Further research into proper selection of Boolean encodings, incremental SAT checking, efficient handling of transitivity, and the generation of unsatisfiable cores for locating errors are expected to make our technique practical.

2004-01-01 - Region-based partial dead code elimination on predicated code

Article:
This paper presents the design, implementation and experimental evaluation of a practical region-based partial dead code elimination (PDE) algorithm on predicated code in an existing compiler framework. Our algorithm processes PDE candidates using a worklist and reasons about their partial deadness using predicate partition graphs. It operates uniformly on hyperblocks and regions comprising basic blocks and hyperblocks. The result of applying our algorithm to an SEME region is optimal: partially dead code cannot be removed without changing the branching structure of the program or potentially introducing new predicate defining instructions. We present statistic evidence about the PDE opportunities in the 12 SPECint2000 benchmarks. In addition to exhibit small compilation overheads, our algorithm achieves moderate performance improvements in 8 out of the 12 benchmarks on an Itanium machine. Our performance results and statistics show the usefulness of our algorithm as a pass applied before instruction scheduling.  Springer-Verlag 2004. .

2004-01-01 - Software implementations of division and square root operations for intel itanium processors

Article:
Division and square root are basic operations defined by the IEEE Standard 754-1985 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic [1], and are implemented in hardware in most modern processors. In recent years however, software implementations of these operations have become competitive. The first IEEE-correct implementations in software of the division and square root operations in a mainstream processor appeared in the 1980s [2]. Since then, several major processor architectures adopted similar solutions for division and square root algorithms, including the Intel Itanium Processor Family (IPF). Since the first software algorithms for division and square root were designed and used, improved algorithms were found and complete correctness proofs were carried out. It is maybe possible to improve these algorithms even further. The present paper gives an overview of the IEEE-correct division and square root algorithms for Itanium processors. As examples, a few algorithms for single precision are presented and properties used in proving their IEEE correctness are stated. Non-IEEE variants, less accurate but faster, of the division, square root and also reciprocal and reciprocal square root operations are discussed. Finally, accuracy and performance numbers are given. The algorithms presented here are inlined by the Intel and other compilers for IPF, whenever division and square root operations are performed. .

2004-01-01 - Software pipelining: An effective scheduling technique for VLIW machines

Article:
The basic idea behind software pipelining was first developed by Patel and Davidson for scheduling hardware pipe-lines. As instruction-level parallelism made its way into general-purpose computing, it became necessary to automate scheduling. How and whether instructions can be scheduled statically have major ramifications on the design of computer architectures. Rau and Glaeser were the first to use software pipelining in a compiler for a machine with specialized hardware designed to support software pipelining. In the meantime, trace scheduling was touted to be the scheduling technique of choice for VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) machines. The most important contribution from this paper is to show that software pipelining is effective on VLIW machines without complicated hardware support. Our understanding of software pipelining subsequently deepened with the work of many others. And today, software pipelining is used in all advanced compilers for machines with instruction-level parallelism, none of which, except the Intel Itanium, relies on any specialized support for software pipelining. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article Towards Itanium:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article primarily focuses on the history and effectiveness of software pipelining as a scheduling technique for VLIW machines. It highlights the evolution of software pipelining, from its initial development for hardware pipelines to its implementation in compilers for VLIW architectures. The article also emphasizes that software pipelining can be effective on VLIW machines without requiring complex hardware support. 

**Mention of Itanium:**

The article mentions the Intel Itanium specifically only once: "And today, software pipelining is used in all advanced compilers for machines with instruction-level parallelism, none of which, **except the Intel Itanium**, relies on any specialized support for software pipelining." 

**Analysis:**

This single mention of Itanium contrasts it with all other advanced compilers for machines with instruction-level parallelism. The implication is that Itanium is the only one that *does* rely on specialized support for software pipelining. While the article doesn't explicitly state this is a negative thing, the phrasing implies that the reliance on specialized support is something that *sets Itanium apart* from other advanced compilers. This suggests a subtle critique of Itanium's design, potentially indicating that its reliance on specialized support might be less efficient or flexible compared to other approaches.

**Sentiment Score:**

Considering the subtle but suggestive critique of Itanium's reliance on specialized support, the sentiment towards Itanium can be categorized as:

**[-1] - Signs of critique** 

The article doesn't explicitly condemn Itanium, but the indirect comparison highlights its reliance on specialized support as a difference, potentially implying a less desirable approach.

2004-01-01 - Super Scalar Sample Sort

Article:
Sample sort, a generalization of quicksort that partitions the input into many pieces, is known as the best practical comparison based sorting algorithm for distributed memory parallel computers. We show that sample sort is also useful on a single processor. The main algorithmic insight is that element comparisons can be decoupled from expensive conditional branching using predicated instructions. This transformation facilitates optimizations like loop unrolling and software pipelining. The final implementation, albeit cache efficient, is limited by a linear number of memory accesses rather than the (n log n) comparisons. On an Itanium 2 machine, we obtain a speedup of up to 2 over std::sort from the GCC STL library, which is known as one of the fastest available quicksort implementations.  Springer-Verlag 2004. .

2004-01-01 - SYZYGY - A framework for scalable cross-module IPO

Article:
Performing analysis across module boundaries for an entire program is important for exploiting several runtime performance opportunities. However, due to scalability problems in existing full-program analysis frameworks, such performance opportunities are only realized by paying tremendous compile-time costs. Alternative solutions, such as partial compilations or user assertions, are complicated or unsafe and as a result, not many commercial applications are compiled today with cross-module optimizations. This paper presents SYZYGY, a practical framework for performing efficient, scalable, interprocedural optimizations. The framework is implemented in the HP-UX Itanium compilers and we have successfully compiled many very large applications consisting of millions of lines of code. We achieved performance improvements of up to 40% over optimization level two and compilation time improvements in the order of 100% and more compared to a previous approach. .

In this paper we report on our experiences with hybrid parallelism in PARDISO, a high-performance sparse linear solver. We start with the OpenMP-parallel numerical factorization algorithm and reorganize it using a central dynamic task queue to be able to add message passing functionality.

2004-01-01 - Testing and Reliability Techniques for High-Bandwidth Embedded RAMs

Article:
Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and high-performance processors such as Itanium and Compaq Alpha use a total of almost 75% of chip real estate for accommodating various types of embedded (or on-chip) memories. Although most of these embedded memories are single-port static (and in relatively few cases, dynamic) RAMs today, the high demand for bandwidth in digital television, fast signal processing, and high-speed networking applications will also fuel the need for on-chip multiport memories in the foreseeable future. The reliability of a complex VLSI chip will depend largely on the reliability of these embedded memory blocks. With device dimensions moving rapidly toward the ultimate physical limits of device scaling, which is in the regime of feature sizes of 50 nm or so, a host of complex failure modes is expected to occur in memory circuits. This tutorial underlines the need for appropriate testing and reliability techniques for the present to the next generation of embedded RAMs. Topics covered include: reliability and quality testing, fault modeling, advanced built-in self-test (BIST), built-in self-diagnosis (BISD), and built-in self-repair (BISR) techniques for high-bandwidth embedded RAMs. .

2004-01-01 - The compiler as a validation and evaluation tool

Article:
Like a processor executes flawlessly at different frequencies, a compiler should produce correct results at any optimization level. The Intel Itanium processor family with its new features, like the register stack engine and control- and data speculation, provides new and unique challenges for ported software and compiler technology. This paper describes validation and evaluation techniques that can be employed in compilation tools and can help to get a cleaner port of an application, a more robust compilation system and even insights into performance tuning opportunities. Using Itanium as a specific example, the paper explains why the register stack engine (RSE), the large register file, or control- and data speculation can potentially expose bugs in poorly written or compiled software. It then demonstrates validation and evaluation techniques to find or expose these bugs. An evaluation team can employ them to find, eliminate and evaluate software bugs. A compiler team can use them to make the compiler more stable and robust. A performance analysis team can use them to uncover performance opportunities in an application. We demonstrate our validation and evaluation techniques on code examples and provide run-time data to indicate the cost of some of our methods. 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. .

2004-01-01 - WBTK: A new set of microbenchmarks to explore memory system performance for scientific computing

Article:
Memory hierarchies are a key component in obtaining high performance on modern microprocessors. To satisfy the ever-increasing demand on data rate access, they are also becoming increasingly complex: multilevel caches, non-blocking caches, sophisticated instructions for supporting prefetch and cache control, etc. If all of these advanced features promise to offer large performance gains, they also generate in some cases performance "anomalies" (i.e. bad performance triggered by specific code patterns). For precisely locating and understanding these anomalies, a new set of microbenchmarks called WBTK is introduced. We show through systematic experimentation on Alpha 21264, Power4 and Itanium 1 that this microbenchmark first allowed us to detect most of the anomalies encountered on simple BLAS1 type codes. Secondly, it led us to demonstrate that vectorization of memory access was an efficient workaround for most of these anomalies. .

2005-01-01 - A general performance model of structured and unstructured mesh particle transport computations

Article:
The performance of unstructured mesh applications presents a number of complexities and subtleties that do not arise for dense structured meshes. From a programming point of view, the handling of unstructured meshes has an increased complexity in order to manage the necessary data structures and interactions between mesh-cells. From a performance point of view, there are added difficulties in understanding both the processing time on a single processor and the scaling characteristics when using large-scale parallel systems. In this work we present a general performance model for the calculation of deterministic S N transport on unstructured meshes that is also applicable to structured meshes. The model captures the key processing characteristics of the calculation and is parametric using both system performance data (latency, bandwidth, processing rate etc.) and application data (mesh size etc.) as input. A single formulation of the model is used to predict the performance of two quite different implementations of the same calculation. It is validated on two clusters (an HP AlphaServer and an Itanium-2 system) showing high prediction accuracy.  2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. .

2005-01-01 - An empirical study of data speculation use on the intel itanium 2 processor

Article:
The Intel Itanium architecture uses a dedicated 32-entry hardware table, the Advanced Load Address Table (ALAT) to support data speculation via an instruction set interface. This study presents an empirical evaluation of the use of the ALAT and data speculative instructions for several optimizing compilers. We determined what and how often compilers generated the different speculative instructions, and used the Itanium's hardware performance counters to evaluate their run-time behavior. We also performed a limit study by modifying one compiler to always generate data speculation when possible. We found that this aggressive approach significantly increased the amount of data speculation and often resulted in performance improvements, of as much as 10% in one case. Since it worsened performance only for one application and then only for some inputs, we conclude that more aggressive data speculation heuristics than those employed by current compilers are desirable and may further improve performance gains from data speculation. .

2005-01-01 - Analyis of path profiling information generated with performance monitoring hardware

Article:
Even with the breakthroughs in semiconductor technology that will enable billion transistor designs, hardwarebased architecture paradigms alone cannot substantially improve processor performance. The challenge in realizing the full potential of these future machines is to find ways to adapt program behavior to application needs and processor resources. As such, run-time optimization will have a distinct role in future high performance systems. However, as these systems are dependent on accurate, fine-grain profile information, traditional approaches to collecting profiles at run-time result in significant slowdowns during program execution. A novel approach to low-overhead profiling is to exploit hardware Performance Monitoring Units (PMUs) present in modern microprocessors. The Itanium-2 PMU can periodically sample the last few taken branches in an executing program and this information can be used to recreate partial paths of execution. With compiler-aided analysis, the partial paths can be correlated into full paths. As statistically hot paths are most likely to occur in PMU samples, even infrequent sampling can accurately identify these paths. While traditional path profiling techniques carry a high overhead, a PMU-based path profiler represents an effective lightweight profiling alternative. This paper characterizes the PMU-based path information and demonstrates the construction of such a PMU-based path profiler for a run-time system. .

2005-01-01 - Cache aware optimization of stream programs

Article:
Effective use of the memory hierarchy is critical for achieving high performance on embedded systems. We focus on the class of streaming applications, which is increasingly prevalent in the embedded domain. We exploit the widespread parallelism and regular communication patterns in stream programs to formulate a set of cache aware optimizations that automatically improve instruction and data locality. Our work is in the context of the Synchronous Dataflow model, in which a program is described as a graph of independent actors that communicate over channels. The communication rates between actors are known at compile time, allowing the compiler to statically model the caching behavior. We present three cache aware optimizations: 1) execution scaling, which judiciously repeats actor executions to improve instruction locality, 2) cache aware fusion, which combines adjacent actors while respecting instruction cache constraints, and 3) scalar replacement, which converts certain data buffers into a sequence of scalar variables that can be register allocated. The optimizations are founded upon a simple and intuitive model that quantifies the temporal locality for a sequence of actor executions. Our implementation of cache aware optimizations in the StreamIt compiler yields a 249% average speedup (over unoptimized code) for our streaming benchmark suite on a StrongARM 1110 processor. The optimizations also yield a 154% speedup on a Pentium 3 and a 152% speedup on an Itanium 2. Copyright 2005 ACM. .

2005-01-01 - Cache aware optimization of stream programs

Article:
Effective use of the memory hierarchy is critical for achieving high performance on embedded systems. We focus on the class of streaming applications, which is increasingly prevalent in the embedded domain. We exploit the widespread parallelism and regular communication patterns in stream programs to formulate a set of cache aware optimizations that automatically improve instruction and data locality. Our work is in the context of the Synchronous Dataflow model, in which a program is described as a graph of independent actors that communicate over channels. The communication rates between actors are known at compile time, allowing the compiler to statically model the caching behavior. We present three cache aware optimizations: 1) execution scaling, which judiciously repeats actor executions to improve instruction locality, 2) cache aware fusion, which combines adjacent actors while respecting instruction cache constraints, and 3) scalar replacement, which converts certain data buffers into a sequence of scalar variables that can be register allocated. The optimizations are founded upon a simple and intuitive model that quantifies the temporal locality for a sequence of actor executions. Our implementation of cache aware optimizations in the StreamIt compiler yields a 249% average speedup (over unoptimized code) for our streaming benchmark suite on a StrongARM 1110 processor. The optimizations also yield a 154% speedup on a Pentium 3 and a 152% speedup on an Itanium 2. Copyright 2005 ACM. .

Title:
2005-01-01 - Compiler optimization-space exploration

Article:
To meet the performance demands of modern architectures, compilers incorporate an ever-increasing number of aggressive code transformations. Since most of these transformations are not universally beneficial, compilers traditionally control their application through predictive heuristics, which attempt to judge an optimization's effect on final code quality a priori. However, complex target architectures and unpredictable optimization interactions severely limit the accuracy of these judgments, leading to performance degradation because of poor optimization decisions. This performance loss can be avoided through the iterative compilation approach, which advocates exploring many optimization options and selecting the best one a posteriori. However, existing iterative compilation systems suffer from excessive compile times and narrow application domains. By overcoming these limitations, Optimization-Space Exploration (OSE) becomes the first iterative compilation technique suitable for general-purpose production compilers. OSE narrows down the space of optimization options explored through limited use of heuristics. A compiler tuning phase further limits the exploration space. At compile time, OSE prunes the remaining optimization configurations in the search space by exploiting feedback from earlier configurations tried. Finally, rather than measuring actual runtimes, OSE compares optimization outcomes through static performance estimation, further enhancing compilation speed. An OSE-enhanced version of Intel's reference compiler for the Itanium architecture yields a performance improvement of more than 20% for some SPEC benchmarks. . Keywords:;

2005-01-01 - Design of a software distributed shared memory system using an MPI communication layer

Article:
We designed and implemented a software distributed shared memory (DSM) system, SCASH-MPI, by using MPI as the communication layer of the SCASH DSM. With MPI as the communication layer, we could use high-speed networks with several clusters and high portability. Furthermore, SCASH-MPI can use high-speed networks with MPI, which is the most commonly available communication library. On the other hand, existing software DSM systems usually use a dedicated communication layer, TCP, or UDP-Ethernet. SCASH-MPI avoids the need for a large amount of pin-down memory for shared memory use that has limited the applications of the original SCASH. In SCASH-MPI, a thread is created to support remote memory communication using MPI. An experiment on a 4-node Itanium cluster showed that the Laplace Solver benchmark using SCASH-MPI achieves a performance comparable to the original SCASH. Performance degradation is only 6.3% in the NPB BT benchmark Class B test. In SCASH-MPI, page transfer does not start until a page fault is detected. To hide the latency of page transmission, we implemented a prefetch function. The latency in BT Class B was reduced by 64% when the prefetch function was used.  2005 IEEE. .

2005-01-01 - Efficiently implementing LL/SC objects shared by an unknown number of processes

Article:
Over the past decade, a pair of instructions called load-linked (LL) and store-conditional (SC) have emerged as the most suitable synchronization instructions for the design of lock-free algorithms. However, current architectures do not support these instructions; instead, they support either CAS (e.g., UltraSPARC, Itanium) or restricted versions of LL/SC (e.g., POWER4, MIPS, Alpha). To bridge this gap, a flurry of algorithms that implement LL/SC from CAS have appeared in the literature. Some of these algorithms assume that N, the maximum number of participating processes, is fixed and known in advance. Others make no such assumption, but are either non-blocking (not wait-free), implement small LL/SC objects, or require that a process performs O(N) work to join the algorithm. Specifically, no constant-time, word-sized, wait-free LL/SC algorithm that does not require the knowledge of N exists. In this paper, we present such an algorithm.

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article Towards Itanium

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on the implementation of Load-Linked (LL) and Store-Conditional (SC) instructions, which are crucial for lock-free algorithms. The authors point out that while LL/SC are desirable, they are not directly supported by many architectures. The article addresses the problem of implementing LL/SC functionality using existing instructions like Compare and Swap (CAS) on architectures like Itanium.  

The article's main goal is to present a new algorithm for efficiently implementing LL/SC objects without prior knowledge of the maximum number of participating processes. This algorithm aims to be constant-time, word-sized, and wait-free, addressing limitations of existing solutions. 

**Sentiment Towards Itanium:**

The article mentions Itanium as an example of an architecture that uses CAS instead of LL/SC.  It states that Itanium "supports either CAS (e.g., UltraSPARC, Itanium) or restricted versions of LL/SC (e.g., POWER4, MIPS, Alpha)." This statement implicitly acknowledges that Itanium does not have the "ideal" LL/SC instructions. However, it does not express any criticism or negative sentiment toward Itanium. 

**Sentiment Score:**

The article mentions Itanium as a representative of an architecture that utilizes CAS instead of LL/SC, but does not offer any negative commentary or judgment. Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium is **[0] - Neutral**.

2005-01-01 - Fine-grain stacked register allocation for the itanium architecture

Article:
The introduction of a hardware managed register stack in the Itanium Architecture creates an opportunity to optimize both the frequency in which a compiler requests allocation of registers from this stack and the number of registers requested. The Itanium Architecture specifies the implementation of a Register Stack Engine (RSE) that automatically performs register spills and fills. However, if the compiler requests too many registers, through the alloc instruction, the RSE will be forced to execute unnecessary spill and fill operations. In this paper we introduce the formulation of the fine-grain register stack frame sizing problem. The normal interaction between the compiler and the RSE suggested by the Itanium Architecture designers is for the compiler to request the maximum number of registers required by a procedure at the procedure invocation. Our new problem formulation allows for more conservative stack register allocation because it acknowledges that the number of registers required in different control flow paths varies significantly. We introduce a basic algorithm to solve the stack register allocation problem, and present our preliminary performance results from the implementation of our algorithm in the Open64 compiler.

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on optimizing register allocation for the Itanium architecture, specifically addressing the issue of the Register Stack Engine (RSE). The authors highlight the potential inefficiencies caused by the compiler requesting too many registers at once, which could lead to unnecessary spill and fill operations. They propose a new approach to the problem by introducing "fine-grain register stack frame sizing," allowing for more conservative allocation based on varying register needs in different control flow paths. 

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

While the article acknowledges the Itanium architecture's innovative RSE, it also identifies a potential issue with its default behavior. The authors explicitly state that the conventional interaction between the compiler and the RSE, as suggested by Itanium architects, can be inefficient. They then propose a solution to address this inefficiency, directly implying that the Itanium architecture could be improved in this area.

**Conclusion:**

The article presents a positive aspect of Itanium (the RSE) but also pinpoints a potential weakness in its implementation.  This suggests a **[1] - Somewhat positive** sentiment towards Itanium. While the authors acknowledge the architecture's positive features, they also highlight areas for improvement, suggesting a constructive critique rather than a negative outlook.

2005-01-01 - Generating cache hints for improved program efficiency

Article:
One of the new extensions in EPIC architectures are cache hints. On each memory instruction, two kinds of hints can be attached: a source cache hint and a target cache hint. The source hint indicates the true latency of the instruction, which is used by the compiler to improve the instruction schedule. The target hint indicates at which cache levels it is profitable to retain data, allowing to improve cache replacement decisions at run time. A compile-time method is presented which calculates appropriate cache hints. Both kind of hints are based on the locality of the instruction, measured by the reuse distance metric. Two alternative methods are discussed. The first one profiles the reuse distance distribution, and selects a static hint for each instruction. The second method calculates the reuse distance analytically, which allows to generate dynamic hints, i.e. the best hint for each memory access is calculated at run-time. The implementation of the static hints scheme in the Open64-compiler for the Itanium processor shows a speedup of 10% on average on a set of pointer-intensive and regular loop-based programs. The analytical approach with dynamic hints was implemented in the FPT-compiler and shows up to 34% reduction in cache misses.  2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. .

2005-01-01 - Hardware-software collaborative techniques for runtime profiling and phase transition detection

Article:
Dynamic optimization relies on runtime profile information to improve the performance of program execution. Traditional profiling techniques incur significant overhead and are not suitable for dynamic optimization. In this paper, a new profiling technique is proposed, that incorporates the strength of both software and hardware to achieve near-zero overhead profiling. The compiler passes profiling requests as a few bits of information in branch instructions to the hardware, and the processor executes profiling operations asynchronously in available free slots or on dedicated hardware. The compiler instrumentation of this technique is implemented using an Itanium research compiler. The result shows that the accurate block profiling incurs very little overhead to the user program in terms of the program scheduling cycles. For example, the average overhead is 0.6% for the SPECint95 benchmarks. The hardware support required for the new profiling is practical. The technique is extended to collect edge profiles for continuous phase transition detection. It is believed that the hardware-software collaborative scheme will enable many profile-driven dynamic optimizations for EPIC processors such as the Itanium processors.  2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. .

2005-01-01 - Impact of compiler-based data-prefetching techniques on SPEC OMP application performance

Article:
In this paper, we evaluate the benefits achievable from software data-prefetching techniques for OpenMP* C/C++ and Fortran benchmark programs, using the framework of the Intel production compiler for the Intel Itanium 2 processor. Prior work on software data-prefetching study has primarily focused on benchmark performance in the context of a few software data-prefetching schemes developed in research compilers. In contrast, our study is to examine the impact of an extensive set of software data-prefetching schemes on the performance of multi-threaded execution using a full set of SPEC OMPM2001 applications with a product compiler on a commercial multiprocessor system. This paper presents performance results showing that compiler-based software data-prefetching supported in the Intel compiler results in significant performance gain, viz., 11.88% to 99.85% gain for 6 out of 11 applications, 3.83% to 6.96% gain for 4 out of 11 applications, with only one application obtaining less than 1% gain on an Intel Itanium 2 processor based SGI* Altix* 32-way shared-memory multiprocessor system. .

The instruction scheduler is one of the weakest points of GCC on IA-64 architecture. This paper will describe an ongoing project for improving GCC instruction scheduling for Itanium. We aim at adding support for IA-64 control and data speculation to GCC, doing this similarly to the existing implementation of interblock motions. Our work on this issue forces us to address weakness of the alias analysis used in the scheduler. Absence of the address displacement on IA-64 makes the problem even more relevant. We suggest the following improvements: 1) propagation of points-to information from tree-ssa to RTL for pointers, and 2) tracking pointer arithmetic, which is performed for addressing non-pointer variables, in alias.c. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on the challenge of improving instruction scheduling within the GCC compiler specifically for the IA-64 architecture, also known as Itanium.  The core issue identified is the weakness of GCC's instruction scheduler on this architecture. The author outlines their project aimed at enhancing the scheduler by incorporating support for IA-64's control and data speculation, drawing parallels to existing interblock motion techniques. 

This project is further complicated by the lack of address displacement on IA-64, highlighting the need for better alias analysis. The article proposes two key improvements: 

1.  Propagating points-to information from tree-SSA to RTL for pointers
2.  Tracking pointer arithmetic within the alias.c module

**Sentiment Towards Itanium:**

The article doesn't explicitly praise or condemn Itanium. Instead, it acknowledges the architecture's unique challenges, particularly the lack of address displacement, which makes instruction scheduling more complex.  While these challenges are presented as obstacles, they are framed as opportunities for improvement rather than inherent flaws. The article's focus is on refining the GCC compiler to better handle Itanium's specific characteristics. 

**Sentiment Score:**

[0] - Neutral.

While the article acknowledges complexities associated with Itanium, it does not express a negative sentiment towards the architecture. The focus remains on improving the compiler's performance for Itanium, not on criticizing the architecture itself.

2005-01-01 - Itanium  A system implementors tale

Article:
Itanium is a fairly new and rather unusual architecture. Its defining feature is explicitly-parallel instruction-set computing (EPIC), which moves the onus for exploiting instruction-level parallelism (ILP) from the hardware to the code generator. Itanium theoretically supports high degrees of ILP, but in practice these are hard to achieve, as present compilers are often not up to the task. This is much more a problem for systems than for application code, as compiler writers efforts tend to be focused on SPEC benchmarks, which are not representative of operating systems code. As a result, good OS performance on Itanium is a serious challenge, but the potential rewards are high. EPIC is not the only interesting and novel feature of Itanium. Others include an unusual MMU, a huge register set, and tricky virtualisation issues. We present a number of the challenges posed by the architecture, and show how they can be overcome by clever design and implementation.  2005 USENIX Association. All rights reserved. .

2005-01-01 - Making CSB+-trees processor conscious

Article:
Cache-conscious indexes, such as CSB+-tree, are sensitive to the underlying processor architecture. In this paper, we focus on how to adapt the CSB+-tree so that it performs well on a range of different processor architectures. Previous work has focused on the impact of node size on the performance of the CSB+-tree. We argue that it is necessary to consider a larger group of parameters in order to adapt CSB+-tree to processor architectures as different as Pentium and Itanium. We identify this group of parameters and study how it impacts the performance of CSB+-tree on Itanium 2. Finally, we propose a systematic method for adapting CSB+-tree to new platforms. This work is a first step towards integrating CSB+-tree in MySQL's heap storage manager. Copyright 2005 ACM. .

2005-01-01 - Module-aware translation for real-life desktop applications

Article:
A dynamic binary translator is a just-in-time compiler that translates source architecture binaries into target architecture binaries on the fly. It enables the fast running of the source architecture binaries on the target architecture. Traditional dynamic binary translators invalidate their translations when a module is unloaded, so later reloading of the same module will lead to a full retranslation. Moreover, most of the loading and unloading are performed on a few "hot" modules, which causes the dynamic binary translator to spend a significant amount of time on repeatedly translating these "hot" modules. Furthermore, the retranslation may lead to excessive memory consumption if the code pages containing the translated codes that have been invalidated are not timely recycled. In addition, we observed that the overhead for translating real-life desktop applications is a big challenge to the overall performance of the applications, and our detailed analysis proved that real-life desktop applications dynamically load and unload modules much more frequently as compared to popular benchmarks, such as SPEC CPU2000. To address these issues, we propose a translation reuse engine that uses a novel verification method and a module-aware memory management mechanism. The proposed approach was fully implemented in IA-32 Execution Layer (IA-32 EL) [1], a commercial dynamic binary translator that enables the execution of IA-32 applications on Intel Itanium processor family. Collected results show that the module-aware translation improves the performance of Adobe* Illustrator by 14.09% and Microsoft* Publisher by 9.73%. The overhead brought by the translation reuse engine accounts for no more than 0.2% of execution time. Copyright 2005 ACM. .

2005-01-01 - MX2 processor module: Twice the processors in half the volume

Article:
Computer manufacturer's are constantly trying to tweek more performance out of their existing products by using the highest performing processors. Typically, manufacturers upgrade the platforms by simply replacing the old processor with the latest speed processor. Like other manufacturers, HP generally follows this practice with the exception ot HP's innovative mx2 module. This unique module used two Itanium-2 "Madison" processors packaged in the same physical volume as a single Itanium-2 processor. In addition, the module plugs into a standard Itanium-2 motherboard socket and requires no additional power capacity. As a result, the development team was able get 50% more performance[1] from a socket without increasing power by actively managing the power to the two processors. Thus, the performance per watt was substantially improved. This paper will provide an overview of some of the key packaging and power innovations that made the processor module a reality such as: 1) mezzanine power for space savings. The standard Itanium 2 processor has a power converter adjacent to the processor. HP engineers chose to put power on top of the processor which provided more room but made cooling the processors a challenge. 2) high performance mechnical gap filler. One of the biggest issues in the module was to develop a thermal gap filler that absorbed 0.060" of tolerance between the two processors. The thermal resistance of this technology was an order of magnitude better than anything commercially available in the industry. 3) Power Aware Architecture. This newly developed power mangement technology actively controls power to the processors. When system (thermal and power) extremes were exceeded by worst case abnormal code, the performance was throttled down until the worst case scenario had past. The combination of these advancements has delivered an innovative solution for a highly challenging design problem. This module is now shipping as the mx2 processor module in HP's Integrity Servers and has been viewed as an engineering marvel by HP executives. Copyright  2005 by ASME. .

2005-01-01 - N-bit unsigned division via N-bit multiply-add

Article:
Integer division on modern processors is expensive compared to multiplication. Previous algorithms for performing unsigned division by an invariant divisor, via reciprocal approximation, suffer in the worst case from a common requirement for n+1 bit multiplication, which typically must be synthesized from n-bit multiplication and extra arithmetic operations. This paper presents, and proves, a hybrid of previous algorithms that replaces n+1 bit multiplication with a single fused multiply-add operation on n-bit operands, thus reducing any n-bit unsigned division to the upper n bits of a multiply-add, followed by a single right shift. An additional benefit is that the prerequisite calculations are simple and fast. On the Itanium 2 processor, the technique is advantageous for as few as two quotients that share a common run-time divisor.  2005 IEEE. .

2005-01-01 - Near overhead-free heterogeneous thread-migration

Article:
Thread migration moves a single call-stack to another machine to improve either load balancing or locality. Current approaches for checkpointing and thread migration are either not heterogeneous or they introduce large runtime overhead. In general, previous approaches add overhead by instrumenting each function in a program. The instrumentation costs are then even incurred when no thread migration is performed. In this respect our system is near-overhead free: nearly no overhead is caused if no migration is performed. Our implementation instead generates metafunctions for each location in the code where a function is called. These functions portably save and rebuild activation records to and from a machine-independent format. Each variable of an activation record is described in terms of its usages in a machine-independent 'Usage Descriptor String' to enable heterogeneous, near overhead free thread migration with as few as possible changes to a compiler. Our resulting thread migration solution is, for example, able to move a thread between an x86 machine (few registers, 32 bits) and an Itanium machine (many registers, 64 bits). Furthermore, we (optionally) move the decision on when and where to migrate to the application programmer instead of implementing a fixed 'fits-all' heuristics as in previous approaches. .

2005-01-01 - Neutron ser characterization of microprocessors

Article:
Hadrons generated by the primary cosmic rays penetrating the atmosphere have a negative impact on the reliability of semiconductor devices. The electrical charge induced by high energy particles manifests as a current spike and can affect both storage elements and combinational logic. Frequency of occurrence of the errors induced by this failure mechanism is referred to as soft error rate (SER). Continuous shrinking of the electronic devices and the lower supply voltages, in conjunction with the increased complexity of VLSI circuits, have led to higher SER. The impact of semiconductor technology scaling on neutron induced SER is discussed in this report. The experimental methodology and results of accelerated measurements carried out on Intel Itanium microprocessors, at Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE), are presented. Statistically significant values of the MTTF induced by high-energy neutrons are also derived, as a function of the number of upsets observed over the duration of the experiment. The presented approach doesn't require any proprietary data about the microprocessor under evaluation and, as a consequence, can be used as a dependability benchmarking tool both by manufacturers and independent evaluators.  2005 IEEE. .

Today's applications are being built in new ways. The advent of service-oriented architectures, modern networking protocols and industry-standard components at all levels open seemingly endless possibilities for new applications and services. But these new possibilities carry new challenges as well, especially in the area of highperformance, mission-critical, transactional applications, often involving financial and other sensitive data which carries security and auditability requirements. This talk will focus on the particular challenges for servers and how these challenges are being addressed. The NonStop Enterprise Division of HP (formerly Tandem Computers) has built massively parallel, hardware and software fault-tolerant servers since 1975. These servers power many of the most challenging transaction processing environments that exist, including major stock exchanges, funds transfer applications, credit and debit card applications, E911 applications, major telephony and instant messaging applications, and integrated hospital applications. The system is based on a message-oriented architecture and thus bears many similarities internally to the architectural principals being espoused for today's service-oriented architectures. HP is bringing to market a new generation of Integrity NonStop Servers, based on an innovative design using Intel Itanium 2 processors and leveraging many other industry standards. This talk will describe how the new generation of servers can accomplish even higher levels of availability than current systems while at the same time leveraging industry standards and meeting other extreme requirements. The talk will also touch on the lessons learned over the years when dealing with mission-critical applications and how those lessons apply to today's distributed, service-oriented architectures. The underlying message is that careful use of encapsulation, limiting the use of distributed algorithms to carefully controlled situations, and overall design rigor are required even more than ever.  2005 IEEE. .

2005-01-01 - Optimizing structures in object oriented programs

Article:
In this paper we demonstrate that effective structure optimization is essential to improve code quality and reduce compilation overhead for object-oriented programs. We propose to address this problem by using an effective representation of structure operation, folding indirect memory accesses to structure fields, flattening structures judiciously, and allowing more aggressive procedure inlining, These techniques enable the existing scalar optimizations, which were well tuned for the traditional imperative languages, to work effectively on object-oriented programs, allowing them to make better use of the performance enhancing-features available on modern processors. We have implemented this strategy in an SSA based global optimization framework in the Open Research Compiler, targeting the Itanium Processor Family.

2005-01-01 - Pairwise local structural alignment of RNA sequences with sequence similarity less than 40%

Article:
Motivation: Searching for non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes and structural RNA elements (eleRNA) are major challenges in gene finding today as these often are conserved in structure rather than in sequence. Even though the number of available methods is growing, it is still of interest to pairwise detect two genes with low sequence similarity, where the genes are part of a larger genomic region. Results: Here we present such an approach for pairwise local alignment which is based on FOLDALIGN and the Sankoff algorithm for simultaneous structural alignment of multiple sequences. We include the ability to conduct mutual scans of two sequences of arbitrary length while searching for common local structural motifs of some maximum length. This drastically reduces the complexity of the algorithm. The scoring scheme includes structural parameters corresponding to those available for free energy as well as for substitution matrices similar to RIBOSUM. The new FOLDALIGN implementation is tested on a dataset where the ncRNAs and eleRNAs have sequence similarity <40% and where the ncRNAs and eleRNAs are energetically indistinguishable from the surrounding genomic sequence context. The method is tested in two ways: (1) its ability to find the common structure between the genes only and (2) its ability to locate ncRNAs and eleRNAs in a genomic context. In case (1), it makes sense to compare with methods like Dynalign, and the performances are very similar, but FOLDALIGN is substantially faster. The structure prediction performance for a family is typically around 0.7 using Matthews correlation coefficient. In case (2), the algorithm is successful at locating RNA families with an average sensitivity of 0.8 and a positive predictive value of 0.9 using a BLAST-like hit selection scheme.  The Author 2005.

2005-01-01 - Performance of OSCAR multigrain parallelizing compiler on SMP servers

Article:
This paper describes performance of OSCAR multigrain parallelizing compiler on various SMP servers, such as IBM pSeries 690, Sun Fire V880, Sun Ultra 80, NEC TX7/i6010 and SGI Altix 3700. The OSCAR compiler hierarchically exploits the coarse grain task parallelism among loops, subroutines and basic blocks and the near fine grain parallelism among statements inside a basic block in addition to the loop parallelism. Also, it allows us global cache optimization over different loops, or coarse grain tasks, based on data localization technique with inter-array padding to reduce memory access overhead. Current performance of OSCAR compiler is evaluated on the above SMP servers. For example, the OSCAR compiler generating OpenMP parallelized programs from ordinary sequential Fortran programs gives us 5.7 times speedup, in the average of seven programs, such as SPEC CFP95 tomcatv, swim, su2cor, hydro2d, mgrid, applu and turb3d, compared with IBM XL Fortran compiler 8.1 on IBM pSeries 690 24 processors SMP server. Also, it gives us 2.6 times speedup compare with Intel Fortran Itanium Compiler 7.1 on SGI Altix 3700 Itanium 2 16 processors server, 1.7 times speedup compared with NEC Fortran Itanium Compiler 3.4 on NEC TX7/i6010 Itanium 2 8 processors server, 2.5 times speedup compared with Sun Forte 7.0 on Sun Ultra 80 UltraSPARC II 4 processors desktop workstation, and 2.1 times speedup compare with Sun Forte compiler 7.1 on Sun Fire V880 UltraSPARC III Cu 8 processors server.

2005-01-01 - Pin: Building customized program analysis tools with dynamic instrumentation

Article:
Robust and powerful software instrumentation tools are essential for program analysis tasks such as profiling, performance evaluation, and bug detection. To meet this need, we have developed a new instrumentation system called Pin. Our goals are to provide easy-to-use, portable, transparent, and efficient instrumentation. Instrumentation tools (called Pintools) are written in C/C++ using Pin's rich API. Pin follows the model of ATOM, allowing the tool writer to analyze an application at the instruction level with-out the need for detailed knowledge of the underlying instruction set. The API is designed to be architecture independent whenever possible, making Pintools source compatible across different architectures. However, a Pintool can access architecture-specific details when necessary. Instrumentation with Pin is mostly transparent as the application and Pintool observe the application's original, uninstrumented behavior. Pin uses dynamic compilation to instrument executables while they are running. For efficiency, Pin uses several techniques, including inlining, register re-allocation, liveness analysis, and instruction scheduling to optimize instrumentation. This fully automated approach delivers significantly better instrumentation performance than similar tools. For example, Pin is 3.3x faster than Valgrind and 2x faster than DynamoRIO for basic-block counting. To illustrate Pin's versatility, we describe two Pintools in daily use to analyze production software. Pin is publicly available for Linux platforms on four architectures: IA32 (32-bit x86), EM64T (64-bit x86), Itanium, and ARM. In the ten months since Pin 2 was released in July 2004, there have been over 3000 downloads from its website. Copyright 2005 ACM. .

2005-01-01 - Practical compiler techniques on efficient multithreaded code generation for OpenMP programs

Article:
State-of-the-art multiprocessor systems pose several difficulties: (i) the user has to parallelize the existing serial code; (ii) explicitly threaded programs using a thread library are not portable; (iii) writing efficient multi-threaded programs requires intimate knowledge of machine's architecture and micro-architecture. Thus, well-tuned parallelizing compilers are in high demand to leverage state-of-the-art computer advances of NUMA-based multiprocessors, simultaneous multi-threading processors and chip-multiprocessor systems in response to the performance quest from the high-performance computing community. On the other hand, OpenMP* has emerged as the industry standard parallel programming model. Applications can be parallelized using OpenMP with less effort in a way that is portable across a wide range of multiprocessor systems. In this paper, we present several practical compiler optimization techniques and discuss their effect on the performance of OpenMP programs. We elaborate on the major design considerations in a high performance OpenMP compiler and present experimental data based on the implementation of the optimizations in the Intel C++ and Fortran compilers. Interactions of the OpenMP transformation with other sequential optimizations in the compiler are discussed. The techniques in this paper have achieved significant performance improvements on the industry standard SPEC* OMPM2001 and SPEC* OMPL2001 benchmarks, and these performance results are presented for Intel Pentium and Itanium processor based systems.

2005-01-01 - RAxML-OMP: An efficient program for phylogenetic inference on SMPs

Article:
Inference of phylogenetic trees comprising hundreds or even thousands of organisms based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method is computationally extremely intensive. In order to accelerate computations we implemented RAxML-OMP, an efficient OpenMP-parallelization for Symmetric Multi-Processing machines (SMPs) based on the sequential program RAxML-V (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood). RAxML-V is a program for inference of evolutionary trees based upon the ML method and incorporates several advanced search algorithms like fast hill-climbing and simulated annealing. We assess performance of RAxML-OMP on the widely used Intel Xeon, Intel Itanium, and AMD Opteron architectures. RAxML-OMP scales particularly well on the AMD Opteron architecture and achieves even super-linear speedups for large datasets (with a length  5.000 base pairs) due to improved cache-efficiency and data locality. RAxML-OMP is freely available as open source code.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005. .

2005-01-01 - Register allocation for software pipelined multi-dimensional loops

Article:
Software pipelining of a multi-dimensional loop is an important optimization that overlaps the execution of successive outermost loop iterations to explore instruction-level parallelism from the entire n-dimensional iteration space. This paper investigates register allocation for software pipelined multi-dimensional loops. For single loop software pipelining, the lifetime instances of a loop variant in successive iterations of the loop form a repetitive pattern. An effective register allocation method is to represent the pattern as a vector of lifetimes (or a vector lifetime using Rau's terminology) and map it to rotating registers. Unfortunately, the software pipelined schedule of a multi-dimensional loop is considerably more complex, and so are the vector lifetimes in it. In this paper, we develop a way to normalize and represent vector lifetimes in multi-dimensional loop software pipelining, which capture their complexity, while exposing their regularity that enables us to develop a simple, yet powerful solution. Our algorithm is based on the development of a metric, called distance, that quantitatively determines the degree of potential overlapping (conflicts) between two vector lifetimes. We show how to calculate and use the distance, conservatively or aggressively, to guide the register allocation of the vector lifetimes under a bin-packing algorithm framework. The classical register allocation for software pipelined single loops is subsumed by our method as a special case. The method has been implemented in the ORC compiler and produced code for the Itanium architecture. We report the effectiveness of our method on 134 loop nests with 348 loop levels. Several strategies for register allocation are compared and analyzed. Copyright 2005 ACM. .

## Sentiment Analysis:

The article focuses on the optimization technique called "software pipelining" applied to multi-dimensional loops. The goal is to improve the performance of these loops by overlapping execution of different iterations, exploiting instruction-level parallelism. The paper presents a new approach to register allocation for this technique, particularly in the context of multi-dimensional loops, which are more complex than single loops.

The Itanium architecture is mentioned only in passing:

* **"The method has been implemented in the ORC compiler and produced code for the Itanium architecture."**

This statement simply mentions that the proposed register allocation method was implemented and tested on the Itanium platform. There is no further discussion about Itanium's features, performance, or how the method specifically leverages its capabilities. 

**Therefore, the article doesn't express any explicit sentiment towards Itanium, positive or negative. It is merely used as a platform for testing the proposed register allocation algorithm.**

2005-01-01 - Scalable massively parallel artificial neural networks

Article:
There is renewed interest in computational intelligence, due to advances in algorithms, neuroscience, and computer hardware. In addition there is enormous interest in autonomous vehicles (air, ground, and sea) and robotics, which need significant onboard intelligence. Work in this area could not only lead to better understanding of the human brain but also very useful engineering applications. The functioning of the human brain is not well understood, but enormous progress has been made in understanding it and, in particular, the neocortex. There are many reasons to develop models of the brain. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), one type of model, can be very effective for pattern recognition, function approximation, scientific classification, control, and the analysis of time series data. ANNs often use the back-propagation algorithm for training, and can require large training times especially for large networks, but there are many other types of ANNs. Once the network is trained for a particular problem, however, it can produce results in a very short time. Parallelization of ANNs could drastically reduce the training time. An object-oriented, massively-parallel ANN (Artificial Neural Network) software package SPANN (Scalable Parallel Artificial Neural Network) has been developed and is described here. MPI was used to parallelize the C++ code. Only the neurons on tlie edges of the domains were involved in communication, in order to reduce the communication costs and maintain scalability. The back-propagation algorithm was used to train the network. In preliminary tests, the software was used to identify character sets. The code correctly identified all the characters wlien adequate training was used in the network. The code was run on up to 500 Intel Itanium processors with 25,000 neurons and more than 2 billion neuron weights. Various comparisons in training time, forward propagation time, and error reduction were also made. .

2005-01-01 - SWIFT: Software implemented fault tolerance

Article:
To improve performance and reduce power, processor designers employ advances that shrink feature sizes, lower voltage levels, reduce noise margins, and increase clock rates. However, these advances make processors more susceptible to transient faults that can affect correctness. While reliable systems typically employ hardware techniques to address soft-errors, software techniques can provide a lower-cost and more flexible alternative. This paper presents a novel, software-only, transient-fault-detection technique, called SWIFT. SWIFT efficiently manages redundancy by reclaiming unused instruction-level resources present during the execution of most programs. SWIFT also provides a high level of protection and performance with an enhanced control-flow checking mechanism. We evaluate an implementation of SWIFT on an Itanium 2 which demonstrates exceptional fault coverage with a reasonable performance cost. Compared to the best known single-threaded approach utilizing an ECC memory system, SWIFT demonstrates a 51% average speedup. .

This article focuses on the problem of transient faults in processors due to miniaturization and the resulting need for fault-tolerant solutions. The core of the article is introducing a new software-based fault detection technique called SWIFT, designed to address this challenge. The Itanium 2 processor is used as a testbed to demonstrate the effectiveness of SWIFT.

**Sentiment Towards Itanium:**

The article doesn't explicitly express a positive or negative sentiment towards Itanium. It mentions Itanium 2 only as the platform used to implement and evaluate SWIFT. The article's focus is on the SWIFT technique itself, not on the merits or flaws of the processor architecture. 

The article does highlight the performance benefit of SWIFT by comparing it to a traditional ECC memory system, and states that SWIFT achieves a 51% average speedup. This implies that Itanium 2 is performing well enough to benefit from the optimization provided by SWIFT. However, this doesn't directly translate to a positive sentiment towards Itanium itself.

**Conclusion:**

The article treats Itanium 2 as a neutral platform for showcasing the effectiveness of SWIFT. While the performance comparison indirectly suggests Itanium 2 is capable of benefiting from the technique, there is no explicit positive or negative sentiment expressed towards the processor itself.

2005-01-01 - The Open Runtime Platform: A flexible high-performance managed runtime environment

Article:
The Open Runtime Platform (ORP) is a high-performance managed runtime environment (MRTE) that features exact generational garbage collection, fast thread synchronization, and multiple coexisting just-in-time compilers (JITs). ORP was designed for flexibility in order to support experiments in dynamic compilation, garbage collection, synchronization, and other technologies. It can be built to run either Java or Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) applications, to run under the Windows or Linux operating systems, and to run on the IA-32 or Itanium processor family (IPF) architectures. Achieving high performance in a MRTE presents many challenges, particularly when flexibility is a major goal. First, to enable the use of different garbage collectors and JITs, each component must be isolated from the rest of the environment through a well-defined software interface. Without careful attention, this isolation could easily harm performance. Second, MRTEs have correctness and safety requirements that traditional languages such as C++ lack. These requirements, including null pointer checks, array bounds checks, and type checks, impose additional runtime overhead. Finally, the dynamic nature of MRTEs makes some traditional compiler optimizations, such as devirtualization of method calls, more difficult to implement or more limited in applicability. To get full performanc, JITs and the core virtual machine (VM) must cooperate to reduce or eliminate (where possible) these MRTE-specific overheads. In this paper, we describe the structure of ORP in detail, paying particular attention to how it supports flexibility while preserving high performance. We describe the interfaces between the garbage collector, the JIT, and the core VM; how these interfaces enable multiple garbage collectors and JITs without sacrificing performance; and how they allow the JIT and the core VM to reduce or eliminate MRTE-specific performance issues.

2005-01-01 - Three algorithms for improving the effectiveness of software pipelining: Comparison and combination

Article:
Software pipelining is a loop scheduling technique that extracts instruction level parallelism by overlapping the execution of several consecutive iterations. One of its drawbacks is the high register requirements, which may lead to software pipelining failure due to insufficient static general registers in Itanium. This paper evaluates the register requirements of software-pipelined loops and presents three new methods for software pipelining loops that require more static general registers than those available in Itanium processor. They reduce register pressure by either reducing instructions in the loop body or allocating stacked non-rotating registers or rotating register in register stack to serve as static registers. These methods are better than the existing techniques in that they further improve performance gain from software pipelining by increasing software-pipelined loops. These methods have been implemented in open research compiler (ORC) targeted for Itanium processor, and they perform well on loops of the programs in NAS Benchmarks. For some benchmarks, the performance is improved by more than 21%. .

2005-01-01 - Unpredication, unscheduling, unspeculation: Reverse engineering itanium executables

Article:
EPIC(Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) architectures, exemplified by the Intel Itanium, support a number of advanced architectural features, such as explicit instruction-level parallelism, instruction predication, and speculative loads from memory. However, compiler optimizations that take advantage of these features can profoundly restructure the program's code, making it potentially difficult to reconstruct the original program logic from an optimized Itanium executable. This paper describes techniques to undo some of the effects of such optimizations and thereby improve the quality of reverse engineering such executables.  2005 IEEE. .

An Itanium Architecture microprocessor in 90-nm CMOS with 1.7B transistors implements a dynamically-variable-frequency clock system. Variable frequency clocks support a power management scheme which maximizes processor performance within a configured power envelope. Core supply voltage and clock frequency are modulated dynamically in order to remain within the power envelope. The Foxton controller and dynamically-variable clock system reside on die while the variable voltage regulator and power measurement resistors reside off chip. In addition, high-bandwidth frequency adjustment allows the clock period to adapt during on-die supply transients, allowing higher frequency processor operation during transients than possible with a single-frequency clock system. .

2006-01-01 - A Lifetime Optimal Algorithm for Speculative PRE

Article:
A lifetime optimal algorithm, called MC-PRE, is presented for the first time that performs speculative PRE based on edge profiles. In addition to being computationally optimal in the sense that the total number of dynamic computations for an expression in the transformed code is minimized, MC-PRE is also lifetime optimal since the lifetimes of introduced temporaries are also minimized. The key in achieving lifetime optimality lies not only in finding a unique minimum cut on a transformed graph of a given CFG, but also in performing a data-flow analysis directly on the CFG to avoid making unnecessary code insertions and deletions. The lifetime optimal results are rigorously proved. We evaluate our algorithm in GCC against three previously published PRE algorithms, namely,MC-PREcomp (Qiong and Xues computationally optimal version of MC-PRE), LCM (Knoop, R uthing, and Steffens lifetime optimal algorithm for performing nonspeculative classic PRE), and CMP-PRE (Bodik, Gupta, and Soffas PRE algorithm based on code-motion preventing (CMP) regions, which is speculative but not computationally optimal). We report and analyze our experimental results, obtained from both actual program execution and instrumentation, for all 22 C, C++ and FORTRAN 77 benchmarks from SPECcpu2000 on an Itanium 2 computer system. Our results show that MC-PRE (or MC-PREcomp) is capable of eliminating more partial redundancies than both LCM and CMP-PRE (especially in functions with complex control flow), and, in addition, MC-PRE inserts temporaries with shorter lifetimes than MC-PREcomp. Each of both benefits has contributed to the performance improvements in benchmark programs at the costs of only small compile-time and code-size increases in some benchmarks.  2006, ACM.

This paper reports on the status of the GNU Modula-2 front end to GCC and the extensions made to Modula-2 and gdb to ease its potential integration into the main GCC source tree. GNU Modula-2 (gm2) is maturing into a reliable tool and it now builds and passes its regression tests on the following platforms: x86, Opteron, Athlon 64, Alpha, Itanium processors running GNU/Linux, Sparc based Solaris, PowerPC MacOS, x86 Open Darwin and the x86 processor running FreeBSD. GNU Modula-2 currently conforms to all three Programming in Modula-2 dialects as defined by Wirth. The paper also describes the two categories of language extensions made. The first category follows the tradition of other GCC front ends by allowing the in-lining of assembly language, conditional compilation, procedure in-lining and allowing users to cleanly exploit the GCC library of built-in functions and constants. The second category provide easy access to C libraries. The work presented here discusses the portable implementation of open arrays, module priorities, coroutine primitives and multi-word sets. It also reports on many of the key design decisions taken during the construction of GNU Modula-2 and their various implications. .

Article:
The register stack (RS) is a major component of the Explicit Parallel Instruction Computer (EPIC) architecture. In this paper, our objective is to close the theoretical performance gap between EPIC and stack processors running virtual stack machines - using Forth, a simple and canonical stack machine. For this purpose, we first introduce a new calling mechanism using the RS to implement a software-only virtual stack machine. Based upon our performance measurements, we show that the new calling mechanism is a promising technique to improve the performance of stack-based interpretative virtual machines. But limitation in EPIC makes the need for hardware support to reach optimal performance. As a second step, we define an addition to Itanium 2 processor's instruction set to accommodate the new calling mechanism. As our third and last step, we describe a conservative architectural implementation of the extended instruction set.  2006 IEEE. .

2006-01-01 - An efficient memory operations optimization technique for vector loops on Itanium 2 processors

Article:
To keep up with a large degree of instruction level parallelism (ILP), the Itanium 2 cache systems use a complex organization scheme: load/store queues, banking and interleaving. In this paper, we study the impact of these cache systems on memory instructions scheduling. We demonstrate that, if no care is taken at compile time, the non-precise memory disambiguation mechanism and the banking structure cause severe performance loss, even for very simple regular codes. We also show that grouping the memory operations in a pseudo-vectorized way enables the compiler to generate more effective code for the Itanium 2 processor. The impact of this code optimization technique on register pressure is analyzed for various valorization schemes. Copyright  2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. .

The main goal is to present a code optimization technique  grouping memory operations in a pseudo-vectorized manner  that effectively mitigates these performance issues.  The article then analyzes the impact of this technique on register pressure using various valorization schemes.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

While the article acknowledges the Itanium 2's impressive instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and its sophisticated cache system, it also highlights the potential pitfalls that arise from its complex architecture. The authors explicitly state that "if no care is taken at compile time, the non-precise memory disambiguation mechanism and the banking structure cause severe performance loss." This implies a potential drawback of the Itanium 2 architecture and suggests a need for careful optimization.

However, the article doesn't dismiss the Itanium 2 as a whole. It rather identifies a specific challenge associated with the architecture and proposes a solution, demonstrating a constructive approach to address the issue.  The authors are actively seeking ways to improve performance, indicating a positive interest in the potential of the Itanium 2 processor.

**Sentiment Score:**

Considering the above, the article leans towards a **[1] - Somewhat positive** sentiment towards Itanium 2. While it acknowledges potential issues, the focus is on addressing these challenges and ultimately leveraging the processor's capabilities. The overall tone is constructive, highlighting both the strengths and weaknesses of the Itanium 2 with an emphasis on finding solutions to optimize its performance.

2006-01-01 - Analysis and characterization of Intel Itanium instruction bundles for improving VLIW processor performance

Article:
In order to achieve high instruction level parallelism (ILP), designers are turning to very long instruction word (VLIW) based designs, in which different types of instructions are grouped together as bundles of 128 bits or longer. In VLIW, the added nops increase the code size, limit processor performance by the wider-utilization of functional units. In examining these performance issues of VLIW systems, we consider Intel first 64-bit architecture, the IA-64, and its first implementation, the Itanium, which employs Intel version of VLIW. We present a comprehensive analysis of the problem of wider-utilization due to nops and stops across a wide range of application domains through the use of three different benchmark suites: SPEC CPU 2000, MediaBench, and PacketBench. Our results show that, on average, nops create an under-utilization factor of 28.46% in the case of SPEC CPU. 32.27% in MediaBench, and 29.76% in PacketBench. We also analyze the characteristics of different instruction bundle formats, which we obtain by collecting statistics concerning the frequency of the bundle formats.  2006 IEEE. .

2006-01-01 - Application of LADA for post-silicon test content and diagnostic tool validation

Article:
Embedded cache size has dramatically increased with the advent of Intel Hyper-Threading and Multi-Core Technology, making many of the existing cache test validation method less and less practical, if not obsolete. As a result, the effort to sustain and improve array test quality, which is ever so critical to achieve DPM goals, is becoming a formidable challenge. In this paper, we present a test content validation procedure through novel application of Laser Assisted Device Alteration (LADA), i.e. soft fault injection in state elements, which had proven itself in Itanium 2 array test quality improvement. While the procedure was originally targeting cache test content, the underlying concept has been successfully deployed to expedite scan test content and fault isolation tool validation.

2006-01-01 - Beating in-order stalls with "Flea-Flicker" two-pass pipelining

Article:
While compilers have generally proven adept at planning useful static instruction-level parallelism for in-order microarchitectures, the efficient accommodation of unanticipable latencies, like those of load instructions, remains a vexing problem. Traditional out-of-order execution hides some of these latencies, but repeats scheduling work already done by the compiler and adds additional pipeline overhead. Other techniques, such as prefetching and multithreading, can hide some anticipable, long-latency misses, but not the shorter, more diffuse stalls due to difficult-to-anticipate, first or second-level misses. Our work proposes a microarchitectural technique, two-pass pipelining, whereby the program executes on two in-order back-end pipelines coupled by a queue. The "advance" pipeline often defers instructions dispatching with unready operands rather than stalling. The "backup" pipeline allows concurrent resolution of instructions deferred by the first pipeline allowing overlapping of useful "advanced" execution with miss resolution. An accompanying compiler technique and instruction marking further enhance the handling of miss latencies. Applying our technique to an Itanium 2-like design achieves a speedup of 1.38x in mcf, the most memory-intensive SPECint2000 benchmark, and an average of 1.12x across other selected benchmarks, yielding between 32 percent and 67 percent of an idealized out-of-order design's speedup at a much lower design cost and complexity.  2006 IEEE. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article towards Itanium

**Topic and Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on the problem of memory latency in processors, particularly the issue of unpredictable cache misses. The author proposes a novel microarchitectural solution called "two-pass pipelining" as a way to improve performance by reducing the impact of these unpredictable stalls. The goal is to achieve a performance gain comparable to out-of-order execution without the added complexity and cost. 

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article uses Itanium 2 as a reference point for evaluating the effectiveness of their proposed "two-pass pipelining" technique. They explicitly mention using "an Itanium 2-like design" as the target architecture.  

However, there's no direct positive or negative sentiment expressed about Itanium itself. The focus remains on the proposed solution and its performance gains compared to an "idealized out-of-order design," which is presented as a more costly alternative. 

The article mentions achieving "between 32 percent and 67 percent of an idealized out-of-order design's speedup" which is presented as a positive outcome. But this comparison is relative to a theoretical ideal, not a direct statement about Itanium's performance. 

**Sentiment Score:**

Given the focus on the proposed solution and its comparison to a hypothetical ideal, rather than a direct evaluation of Itanium, the article leans towards **neutral [0]** regarding Itanium.  The author uses Itanium as a platform for showcasing their technique's effectiveness, not for endorsing or criticizing the architecture itself.

2006-01-01 - Customizing the redesignation process for individual platform interrupts on a soft-partitioned system

Article:
This disclosure relates to the field of operating systems. A technique is disclosed that allows the redesignation process that changes the designated partition on a soft-partitioned system to take actions that are specific to a particular platform interrupt source. A soft-partitioning product supports running multiple operating system instances in individual soft-partitions on a single, physical server The configuration and management of the individual soft-partitions is done by a soft-partition monitor that, on some platforms such as Itanium platforms, runs in an administrative soft-partition and launches individual soft partitions with support from firmware. On such a system, multiple operating system instances will share platform interrupt sources. The soft-partition monitor will allow only one operating system instance (denoted as the designated OS) to program the interrupt controller for a particular platform interrupt source. The designated OS will then handle all the hardware interrupts from that source The soft-partition monitor will manage all the book-keeping associated with tracking which OS instance is handling which interrupt source, and will forward interrupts to the appropriate soft-partition instances for handling by the associated driver's interrupt service routine. When the designated partition on a soft-partitioned system is no longer capable of handling interrupts (due to, for example, a crash, a reboot, a system shutdown, etc.), a new designated partition is chosen via a process known as redesignation According to the present disclosure, the redesignation process is coordinated by the soft-partition monitor. During redesignation, there may be specific tasks associated with each platform interrupt source that need to be performed by the soft-partition monitor. For example, one platform interrupt may require that the interrupt hardware be reset, while another may require certain corrective action specific to the interrupt source To implement this in the soft-partition monitor's redesignation code, each platform interrupt source is associated with a function pointer handle which is invoked when redesignation occurs The function pointer handle is provided to the soft-partition monitor by the interrupt handling subsystem associated with the platform interrupt source. When a redesignation event occurs for a particular interrupt source, the function pointer is used by the soft-partition monitor to invoke the corresponding interrupt handling subsystem In this manner, each platform interrupt source can manage its own specific redesignation-related tasks. As understood with reference to the Figure, in a method 1 of the present disclosure a soft-partition monitor is provided 2 A function handle pointer is associated 3 with each platform interrupt source After a redesignation event occurs 4, the soft-partition monitor invokes 5 the corresponding interrupt handling subsystem via the function pointer handle. Such a technique eliminates the need to provide extra platform interrupt controller hardware to support fine grained partitioning, and enables individual soft partitions to react to platform interrupts similarly to a regular physical server. .

2006-01-01 - Efficiently implementing a large number of LL/SC objects

Article:
Over the past decade, a pair of instructions called load-linked (LL) and store-conditional (SC) have emerged as the most suitable synchronization instructions for the design of lock-free algorithms. However, current architectures do not support these instructions; instead, they support either CAS (e.g., UltraSPARC, Itanium) or restricted versions of LL/SC (e.g., POWER4, MIPS, Alpha). Thus, there is a gap between what algorithm designers want (namely, LL/SC) and what multiprocessors actually support (namely, CAS or RLL/RSC). To bridge this gap, a flurry of algorithms that implement LL/SC from CAS have appeared in the literature. The two most recent algorithms are due to Doherty, Herlihy, Luchangco, and Moir (2004) and Michael (2004). To implement M LL/SC objects shared by N processes, Doherty et al.'s algorithm uses only 0(N + M) space, but is only non-blocking and not wait-free. Michael's algorithm, on the other hand, is wait-free, but uses O(N2 + M) space. The main drawback of his algorithm is the time complexity of the SC operation: although the expected amortized running time of SC is only O(1), the worst-case running time of SC is O(N2). The algorithm in this paper overcomes this drawback. Specifically, we design a waitfree algorithm that achieves a space complexity of O(N2 + M), while still maintaining the O(1) worst-case running time for LL and SC operations.

## Analyzing the Sentiment towards Itanium

The article focuses on the problem of efficiently implementing "load-linked" (LL) and "store-conditional" (SC) instructions, which are crucial for building lock-free algorithms. These instructions enable atomic operations essential for concurrent programming. The core challenge addressed in the paper is that while LL/SC are widely desired, many architectures, like Itanium, only support a similar but less powerful instruction called "compare-and-swap" (CAS). 

The article acknowledges the existence of Itanium and its use of CAS instead of LL/SC. However, it **doesn't explicitly state any opinions about Itanium's design choice.** The paper's primary focus is on presenting a new algorithm that overcomes the limitations of existing LL/SC implementations from CAS, regardless of the specific architecture. 

**Therefore, the article remains neutral towards Itanium.** It simply mentions the architecture as an example of a system using CAS instead of LL/SC. It doesn't express any positive or negative sentiment towards Itanium.

2006-01-01 - High throughput total order broadcast for cluster environments

Article:
Total order broadcast is a fundamental communication primitive that plays a central role in bringing cheap software-based high availability to a wide array of services. This paper studies the practical performance of such a primitive on a cluster of homogeneous machines. We present FSR, a (uniform) total order broadcast protocol that provides high throughput, regardless of message broadcast patterns. FSR is based on a ring topology, only relies on point-to-point inter-process communication, and has a linear latency with respect to the total number of processes in the system. Moreover, it is fair in the sense that each process has an equal opportunity of having its messages delivered by all processes. On a cluster of Itanium based machines, FSR achieves a throughput of 79 Mbit/s on a 100 Mbit/s switched Ethernet network.  2006 IEEE. .

2006-01-01 - Implicit and explicit optimizations for stencil computations

Article:
Stencil-based kernels constitute the core of many scientific applications on block-structured grids. Unfortunately, these codes achieve a low fraction of peak performance, due primarily to the disparity between processor and main memory speeds. We examine several optimizations on both the conventional cache-based memory systems of the Itanium 2, Opteron, and Power5, as well as the heterogeneous multicore design of the Cell processor. The optimizations target cache reuse across stencil sweeps, including both an implicit cache oblivious approach and a cache-aware algorithm blocked to match the cache structure. Finally, we consider stencil computations on a machine with an explicitly-managed memory hierarchy, the Cell processor. Overall, results show that a cache-aware approach is significantly faster than a cache oblivious approach and that the explicitly managed memory on Cell is more efficient: Relative to the Power5, it has almost 2x more memory bandwidth and is 3.7x faster.

2006-01-01 - Improved Superblock optimization in GCC

Article:
Superblock scheduling is a common technique to increase the level of instruction level parallelism (ILP) in generated code. Compared to a basic block, the Superblock gives an optimizer or scheduler a longer range over which instructions can be moved. The bookkeeping necessary to execute that move is less than would be necessary inside an arbitrary trace region. Additionally, the process of forming Superblocks generates more instructions that are eligible for movement. These factors combine to produce a significant increase in the ILP in a section of code. By identifying the key feature of Superblock formation that allows this increase in ILP, we can generalize the concept to describe a class of similar optimizations. We refer to techniques in this class as structural techniques. Combining several optimizations in this class with aggressive classical optimization has been shown in the OpenIMPACT compiler to be particularly useful in developing ILP when compiling for the Itanium processor. As a motivation for our work, we present an investigation into the value of structural compilation in the OpenIMPACT compiler. In this domain, structural techniques have been credited with a 10% to 13% increase in code performance over a compiler that implements only classical optimizations. As a first step toward developing structural compilation techniques in GCC, we implemented Superblock formation at the Tree-SSA level. By performing structural transformations early, we give the compiler's high level optimizers an opportunity to specialize the transformed program, thereby cultivating higher levels of ILP. The early results of this modification are mixed, with some benchmarks improving and others slowing. In this paper, we present details on our implementation and study the effects of this structural transformation on later optimizations. Through this, we hope to motivate future work to implement and improve optimizations that can take advantage of the transformed control flow. .

Article:
Several different techniques and softwares intend to improve the accuracy of results computed in a fixed finite precision. Here we focus on a method to improve the accuracy of the polynomial evaluation. It is well known that the use of the Fused Multiply and Add operation available on some microprocessors like Intel Itanium improves slightly the accuracy of the Horner scheme. In this paper, we propose an accurate compensated Horner scheme specially designed to take advantage of the Fused Multiply and Add. We prove that the computed result is as accurate as if computed in twice the working precision. The algorithm we present is fast since it only requires well optimizable floating point operations, performed in the same working precision as the given data. Copyright 2006 ACM. .

2006-01-01 - Inline analysis: Beyond selection heuristics

Article:
Research on procedure inlining has mainly focused on heuristics that decide whether inlining a particular call-site maximizes application performance. However, other equally important aspects of inline analysis such as call-site analysis order, indirect effects of inlining, and selection of the most profitable version of a procedure warrant more attention. This paper evaluates a number of different sequences in which call-sites are examined for inlining and shows that choosing the correct order is crucial to obtaining the best run-time performance. We then present a novel, work-list-based, and updated sequence that achieves the best results. While applying cross-module inline analysis on large applications with thousands of files and millions of lines of code, we separate the analysis from the transformation phase and allow the former to work solely on summary information in order to reduce compile-time and memory consumption. A focus of this paper is to enumerate the summaries that our compiler maintains, present a technique to compute the goodness factor on which the work-list sequence is based, and describe methods to continuously update the summaries as and when a call-site is accepted for inlining. We then introduce inline specialization, a new technique that facilitates inlining into call chains selectively. The power of inline specialization lies in its ability to choose the most profitable version of the called procedure without having to maintain multiple versions at any point of time. We discuss implementation of these techniques in the HPUX Itanium production compiler and present experimental results showing that a dynamic work-list based analysis order, comprehensive summary updates, and inline specialization significantly improve performance of applications.  2006 IEEE. .

2006-01-01 - Issues and support for dynamic register allocation

Article:
Post-link and dynamic optimizations have become important to achieve program performance. A major challenge in post-link and dynamic optimizations is the acquisition of registers for inserting optimization code in the main program. It is difficult to achieve both correctness and transparency when software-only schemes for acquiring registers are used, as described in [1]. We propose an architecture feature that builds upon existing hardware for stacked register allocation on the Itanium processor. The hardware impact of this feature is minimal, while simultaneously allowing post-link and dynamic optimization systems to obtain registers for optimization in a "safe" manner, thus preserving the transparency and improving the performance of these systems.

Title:
2006-01-01 - Multi-language programming: The challenge and promise of class-level interfacing

Article:
Many computer applications today involve modules written in different programming languages, and integrating these modules together is a delicate operation. This first requires the availability of formalisms to let programmers denote "foreign" entities like objects and subprograms as well as their associated types. Then, proper translation of what programmers express often calls for significant implementation effort, possibly down to the specification of very precise ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces). Meta-language based approaches ala CORBA/IDL are very powerful in this respect but typically aim at addressing distributed systems issues as well, hence entail support infrastructure that not every target environment needs or can afford. When component distribution over a network is not a concern, straight interfacing at the binary object level is much more efficient. It however relies on numerous low level details and in practice is most often only possible for a limited set of constructs. Binary level interaction between foreign modules is traditionally achieved through subprogram calls, exchanging simple data types and relying on the target environment's core ABI. Object Oriented features in modern languages motivate specific additional capabilities in this area, such as class-level interfacing to allow reuse and extension of class hierarchies across languages with minimal constraints. This paper describes work we have conducted in this context, allowing direct binding of Ada extensible tagged types with C++ classes. Motivated by extensions to the Ada typing system made as part of the very recent language standard revision, this work leverages the GCC multilanguage infrastructure and implementation of the Itanium C++ ABI. We will first survey the issues and mechanisms related to basic interlanguage operations, then present the interfacing challenges posed by modern object oriented features after a brief overview of the Ada, C++, and Java object models. We will continue with a description of our work on Ada/C++ classlevel interfacing facilities, illustrated by an example. .

2006-01-01 - New EAX crossover for large TSP instances

Article:
We propose an evolutionary algorithm (EA) that applies to the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The EA uses edge assembly crossover (EAX), which is known to be efficient and effective for solving TSPs. Recently, a fast implementation of EAX and an effective technique for preserving population diversity were proposed. This makes it possible to compare the EA with EAX comparable to state-of-the-art TSP heuristics based on Lin-Karnighan heuristics. We further improved the performance of EAs with EAX, especially for large instances of more than 10,000 cities. Our method can find optimal solutions for instances of up to 24978 cities within a day using a single Itanium 2 1.3-GHz processor. Moreover, our EA found three new best tours for unsolved national TSP instances in a reasonable computation time.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006. .

This report presents a comprehensive survey of the effect of different data layouts on the single processor performance characteristics for the lattice Boltzmann method both for commodity "off-the-shelf" (COTS) architectures and tailored HPC systems, such as vector computers. We cover modern 64-bit processors ranging from IA32 compatible (Intel Xeon/Nocona, AMD Opteron), superscalar RISC (IBM Power4), IA64 (Intel Itanium 2) to classical vector (NEC SX6+) and novel vector (Cray X1) architectures. Combining different data layouts with architecture dependent optimization strategies we demonstrate that the optimal implementation strongly depends on the architecture used. In particular, the correct choice of the data layout could supersede complex cache-blocking techniques in our kernels. Furthermore our results demonstrate that vector systems can outperform COTS architectures by one order of magnitude.  2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. .

2006-01-01 - Optimal register reassignment for register stack overflow minimization

Article:
Architectures with a register stack can implement efficient calling conventions. Using the overlapping of callers and callees registers, callers are able to pass parameters to callees without a memory stack. The most recent instance of a register stack can be found in the Intel Itanium architecture. A hardware component called the register stack engine (RSE) provides an illusion of an infinite-length register stack using a memory-backed process to handle overflow and underflow for a physically limited number of registers. Despite such hardware support, some applications suffer from the overhead required to handle register stack overflow and underflow. The memory latency associated with the overflow and underflow of a register stack can be reduced by generating multiple register allocation instructions within a procedure [Settle et al. 2003]. Live analysis is utilized to find a set of registers that are not required to keep their values across procedure boundaries. However, among those dead registers, only the registers that are consecutively located in a certain part of the register stack frame can be removed. We propose a compiler-supported register reassignment technique that reduces RSE overflow/underflow further. By reassigning registers based on live analysis, our technique forces as many dead registers to be removed as possible. We define the problem of optimal register reassignment, which minimizes interprocedural register stack heights considering multiple call sites within a procedure. We present how this problem is related to a path-finding problem in a graph called a sequence graph. We also propose an efficient heuristic algorithm for the problem. Finally, we present the measurement of effects of the proposed techniques on SPEC CINT2000 benchmark suite and the analysis of the results. The result shows that our approach reduces the RSE cycles by 6.4% and total cpu cycles by 1.7% on average.  2006, ACM. All rights reserved. . Keywords:;

2006-01-01 - Optimised external computation for the Euro50 MATLAB based integrated model

Article:
In previous work we have countered computational demands faced in integrated modelling by developing and using a parallel toolkit for MATLAB. However the use of an increasingly realistic model makes the computational requirements of the model much larger, particularly in wavefront sensing, reaching a point where simulations of several real time seconds were no longer practical taking up to 3 weeks per second. In response to this problem we have developed optimised C code to which MATLAB off loads computation. This code has numerous advantages over native MATLAB computation. It is portable, scaleable using OpenMP directives and can run remotely using Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). It has opened up the possibility of exploiting high end Itanium and Opteron based shared memory systems, optimised 3rd party libraries and aggressive compiler optimisation. These factors combined with hand-tuning give a performance increase of the order of 100 times. The interface to the rest of the model remains the same so the overall structure is unchanged. In addition we have developed a similar system based on Message Passing Interface version 2, (MPI-2) which allows us to exploited clusters. Here we present an analysis of techniques used and gains obtained along with a brief discussion of future work. .

2006-01-01 - Parallel simulation of three-dimensional bursting with MPI and OpenMP

Article:
This work presents a mathematical model and its parallel implementation via two parallel paradigms for the simulation of three-dimensional bursting phenomena. The mathematical model consists of four nonlinearly coupled partial differential equations and includes fast and slow subsystems. The differential equations have been discretized by means of a linearly-implicit finite difference method in equally-spaced grids. The resulting system of equations at each time level has been solved by means of an optimized Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method. The proposed mathematical model has been implemented via: (1) a message passing paradigm based on the standard MPI and (2) a shared address space paradigm based on SPMD OpenMP. The two implementations have been evaluated on two current parallel architectures, i.e., a cluster of biprocessors Xeon and an SGI Altix 3700 Bx2 based on Itanium. It is shown that better performance and scalability are obtained on the second platform.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006. .

2006-01-01 - Partial dead code elimination on predicated code regions

Article:
This paper presents the design, implementation and experimental evaluation of a practical region-based partial dead code elimination (PDE) algorithm on predicated code in the Open Research Compiler framework. Existing PDE algorithms are not applicable on predicated code due to the existence of if-converted branches in the program. The proposed algorithm processes all PDE candidates in a worklist and considers their partial deadness using predicate partition graphs. Our algorithm operates uniformly on individual hyperblocks as well as regions comprising of basic blocks and hyperblocks. The result of applying our algorithm to a single-entry multiple-exit (SEME) region is optimal: partially dead code cannot be removed without changing the branching structure of the program or potentially introducing new predicate defining instructions. We present statistical evidence about the PDE opportunities in the 17 SPEC95 and SPEC00 integer benchmarks. Our algorithm achieves performance improvements in 12 out of the 17 benchmarks on an Itanium machine at small compilation overheads. Our results indicate that our algorithm can be used as a practical pass before instruction scheduling. Copyright  2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. .

2006-01-01 - Performance modeling using Monte Carlo simulation

Article:
Cycle accurate simulation has long been the primary tool for micro-architecture design and evaluation. Though accurate, the slow speed often imposes constraints on the extent of design exploration. In this work, we propose a fast, accurate Monte-Carlo based model for predicting processor performance. We apply this technique to predict the CPI of in-order architectures and validate it against the Itanium-2. The Monte Carlo model uses micro-architecture independent application characteristics, and cache, branch predictor statistics to predict CPI with an average error of less than 7%. Since prediction is achieved in a few seconds, the model can be used for fast design space exploration that can efficiently cull the space for cycle-accurate simulations. Besides accurately predicting CPI, the model also breaks down CPI into various components, where each component quantifies the effect of a particular stall condition (branch mis-prediction, cache miss, etc.) on overall CPI. Such a CPI decomposition can help processor designers quickly identify and resolve critical performance bottlenecks. .

Sparse matrix computations arise in many scientific and engineering applications, but their performance is limited by the growing gap between processor and memory speed. In this paper, we present a case study of an important sparse matrix triple product problem that commonly arises in primal-dual optimization method. Instead of a generic two-phase algorithm, we devise and implement a single pass algorithm that exploits the block diagonal structure of the matrix. Our algorithm uses fewer floating point operations and roughly half the memory of the two-phase algorithm. The speed-up of the one-phase scheme over the two-phase scheme is 2.04 on a 900 MHz Intel Itanium-2, 1.63 on an 1 GHz Power-4, and 1.99 on a 900 MHz Sun Ultra-3.

2006-01-01 - Prematerialization: Reducing register pressure for free

Article:
Modern compiler transformations that eliminate redundant computations or reorder instructions, such as partial redundancy elimination and instruction scheduling, are very effective in improving application performance but tend to create longer and potentially more complex live ranges. Typically the task of dealing with the increased register pressure is left to the register allocator. To avoid introduction of spill code which can reduce or completely eliminate the benefit of earlier optimizations, researchers have developed techniques such as live range splitting and rematerialization. This paper describes prematerialization (PM), a novel method for reducing register pressure for VLIW architectures with nop instructions. PM and rematerialization both select "never killed" live ranges and break them up by introducing one or more definitions close to the uses. However, while rematerialization is applied to live ranges selected for spilling during register allocation, PM relies on the availability of nop instructions and occurs prior to register allocation. PM simplifies register allocation by creating live ranges that are easier to color and less likely to spill. We have implemented prematerialization in HP-UX production compilers for the Intel Itanium architecture. Performance evaluation indicates that the proposed technique is effective in reducing register pressure inherent in highly optimized code. Copyright 2006 ACM. .

2006-01-01 - Processing-in-memory technology for knowledge discovery algorithms

Article:
The goal of this work is to gain insight into whether processing-in-memory (PIM) technology can be used to accelerate the performance of link discovery algorithms, which represent an important class of emerging knowledge discovery techniques. PIM chips that integrate processor logic into memory devices offer a new opportunity for bridging the growing gap between processor and memory speeds, especially for applications with high memory-bandwidth requirements. As LD algorithms are data-intensive and highly parallel, involving read-only queries over large data sets, parallel computing power extremely close (physically) to the data has the potential of providing dramatic computing speedups. For this reason, we evaluated the mapping of LD algorithms to a processing-in-memory (PIM) workstation-class architecture, the DIVA / Godiva hardware testbeds developed by USC/ISI. Accounting for differences in clock speed and data scaling, our analysis shows a performance gain on a single PIM, with the potential for greater improvement when multiple PIMs are used. Measured speedups of 8x are shown on two additional bandwidth benchmarks, even though the Itanium-2 has a clock rate 6X faster. Copyright 2006 ACM. .

## Analysis of the Article's Sentiment towards Itanium:

**Article's Topic and Goal:**

The article explores the potential of "processing-in-memory" (PIM) technology to accelerate the performance of link discovery algorithms (LD). These algorithms are data-intensive and rely on high memory bandwidth for efficient operation. The authors believe that PIM, which integrates processor logic into memory devices, can bridge the gap between processor and memory speeds, thereby improving the performance of LD algorithms. They specifically analyze the mapping of LD algorithms to a PIM architecture called DIVA/Godiva, developed by USC/ISI.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article mentions Itanium-2 only in the context of comparing its performance with a PIM architecture. While the article acknowledges the Itanium-2's faster clock rate (6X faster), it explicitly states that PIM technology achieved "measured speedups of 8x" on two bandwidth benchmarks. This implies that **despite the Itanium-2's higher clock speed, the PIM architecture outperformed it in terms of speed**. 

**Conclusion:**

Although the article does not explicitly criticize Itanium, the comparison highlights the superior performance of the PIM architecture, even when accounting for the Itanium-2's faster clock speed. This suggests a subtle but **negative sentiment towards Itanium**, indicating that PIM technology offers a more efficient solution for the specific applications explored in the article.

2006-01-01 - Recovery code generation for general speculative optimizations

Article:
A general framework that integrates both control and data speculation using alias profiling and/or compiler heuristic rules has shown to improve CPU2000 performance on Itanium systems. However, speculative optimizations require check instructions and recovery code to ensure correct execution when speculation fails at runtime. How to generate check instructions and their associated recovery code efficiently and effectively is an issue yet to be well studied. It is also, very important that the recovery code generated in the earlier phases integrate gracefully in the later optimization phases. At the very least, it should not hinder later optimizations, thus, ensuring overall performance improvement. This paper proposes a framework that uses an if-block structure to facilitate check instructions and recovery code generation for general speculative optimizations. It allows speculative instructions and their recovery code generated in the early compiler optimization phases to be integrated effectively with the subsequent optimization phases. It also allows multilevel speculation for multilevel pointers and multilevel expression trees to be handled with no additional complexity. The proposed recovery code generation framework has been implemented and evaluated in the Open Research Compiler (ORC).  2006, ACM. All rights reserved. . Keywords:;

2006-01-01 - Solution of large complex problems in computational electromagnetics using higher-order basis in MoM with out-of-core solvers

Article:
In a recent invited paper in the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, some of the challenging problems in computational electromagnetics were presented. One of the objectives of this note is to simply point out that challenging to one may be simple to another. This is demonstrated through an example cited in that article. The example chosen is a Vivaldi antenna array. What we discuss here also applies to the other examples presented in that article, but we have chosen the Vivaldi antenna array to help us make our point. It is shown in this short article that a higher-order basis using a surface integral equation a la a PMCHWT (Poggio-Miller-Chu-Harrington-Wu-Tsai) Method-of-Moments formulation may still be the best weapon that one have in today's arsenal to deal with challenging complex electromagnetic analysis problems. Here, we have used the commercially available code WIPL-D to carry out all the computations using laptop/desktop systems. The second objective of this paper is to present an out-of-Gore solver. The goal is to demonstrate that an out-of-core 32-bit-system-based solver can be as efficient as a 64-bit in-core solver. This is quite contrary to the popular belief that an out-of-core solver is generally much slower than an in-core solver. This can be significant, as the difference in the cost of a 32-bit system can be 1/30 of a 64-bit system of similar capabilities using current computer architectures. For the 32-bit system, we consider a Pentium 4 system, whereas for the 64-bit system, we consider an Itanium 2 system for comparison. The out-of-core solver can go beyond the 2 GB limitation for a 32-bit system and can be run on ordinary laptop/desktop; hence, we can simultaneously have a much lower hardware investment while better performance for a sophisticated and powerful electromagnetic solver. The system resources and the CPU times are also outlined.  2006 IEEE. .

2006-01-01 - The implementation of a 2-core, multi-threaded itanium family processor

Article:
The design of the high end server processor code named Montecito incorporated several ambitious goals requiring innovation. The most obvious being the incorporation of two legacy cores on-die and at the same time reducing power by 23%. This is an effective 325% increase in MIPS per watt which necessitated a holistic focus on power reduction and management. The next challenge in the implementation was to ensure robust and high frequency circuit operation in the 90-nm process generation which brings with it higher leakage and greater variability. Achieving this goal required new methodologies for design, a greatly improved and tunable clock system and a better understanding of our power grid behavior all of which required new circuits and capabilities. The final aspect of circuit design improvement involved the I/O design for our legacy multi-drop system bus. To properly feed the two high frequency cores with memory bandwidth we needed to ensure frequency headroom in the operation of the bus. This was achieved through several innovations in controllability and tuning of the I/O buffers which are discussed as well. .

2006-01-01 - Translating between itanium and sparc memory consistency models

Article:
Our general goal is to port programs from one multiprocessor architecture to another, while ensuring that each program's semantics remains unchanged. This paper addresses a subset of the problem by determining the relationships between memory consistency models of three Sparc architectures, (TSO, PSO and RMO) and that of the Itanium architecture. First we consider Itanium programs that are constrained to have only one load-type of instruction in {load, load-acquire}, and one store-type of instruction in {store, store_release}. We prove that in three out of four cases, the set of computations of any such program is exactly the set of computations of the "same" program (using only load and store) on one Sparc architecture. In the remaining case the set is nested between two natural sets of Sparc computations. Real Itanium programs, however, use a mixture of load, load_acquire, store, store-release and memory fence instructions, and real Sparc programs use a variety of barrier instruction as well as load and store instructions. We next show that any mixture of the load-types or the store-types (in the case of Itanium) or any barrier instructions (in the case of Sparc) completely destroys the clean and simple similarities between the sets of computations of these systems. Thus (even without considering the additional complications due to register and control dependencies) transforming these more general programs in either direction requires constraining the transformed program substantially more than the original program in order to ensure that no erroneous computations can arise.

## Analysis of the Article's Sentiment towards Itanium:

**Topic and Goal:**

The article focuses on the problem of porting programs between different multiprocessor architectures while ensuring the program's semantics remain unchanged. Specifically, it examines the relationships between the memory consistency models of Itanium and three different Sparc architectures (TSO, PSO, and RMO). The goal is to determine whether and how programs can be translated between these architectures without introducing errors due to differing memory consistency models.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article starts by analyzing a simplified version of Itanium programs, restricting them to only one type of load and store instruction. In this simplified scenario, the authors find that Itanium's memory model aligns closely with that of certain Sparc architectures in three out of four cases. This suggests that for these simplified programs, translation is possible with minimal changes.

However, the article quickly shifts to discuss real-world Itanium programs which employ a wider range of load and store instructions as well as memory fences. Here, the authors point out a crucial limitation: any mixture of these instructions "completely destroys the clean and simple similarities" between Itanium and Sparc computations. This leads them to conclude that translating more complex Itanium programs to Sparc (or vice versa) requires significantly more constraints and changes to the program, potentially making the translation process very complex and challenging.

**Conclusion:**

While the article initially shows some positive alignment between simplified Itanium programs and certain Sparc architectures, it ultimately emphasizes the significant challenges posed by real-world Itanium programs with their complex instruction sets. The article focuses on the difficulties and limitations of translation, rather than highlighting any advantages of Itanium. 

**Sentiment Score:**  [-1] - Signs of critique. The article focuses on the complexities and potential issues associated with Itanium, highlighting the challenges of translation and implicitly suggesting that simpler Sparc architectures might be more manageable.

Title:
2006-01-01 - Ultra-fast CPU performance prediction: Extending the Monte Carlo approach

Article:
Performance evaluation of contemporary processors is becoming increasingly difficult due to the lack of proper frameworks. Traditionally, cycle-accurate simulators have been extensively used due to their inherent accuracy and flexibility. However, the effort involved in building them, their slow speed, and their limited ability to provide insight often imposes constraints on the extent of design exploration. In this paper, we refine our earlier Monte Carlo based CPIprediction model [11] to include software assisted data-prefetching and an improved memory model. Softwarebased prefetching is becoming an increasingly important feature in modern processors but to the best of our knowledge, existing frameworks do not model it. Our model uses microarchitecture independent application characteristics to predict CPI with an average error of less than 10% when vaidated against the Itanium-2 processor. Besides accurate performance prediction, we illustrate the applications of the model to processor bottle-neck analysis, workload characterization and design space exploration.  2006 IEEE. .

## Analyzing the Sentiment towards Itanium

The article focuses on developing a **more efficient method for predicting CPU performance**. The authors acknowledge the limitations of traditional cycle-accurate simulators, particularly their slow speed and limited ability for design exploration. To address this, they propose **extending a Monte Carlo based CPI prediction model**. This model aims to be more efficient while still providing accurate performance estimations.

The article mentions **software-assisted data-prefetching** as a key feature in modern processors and explicitly states that their model **"uses microarchitecture independent application characteristics to predict CPI with an average error of less than 10% when validated against the Itanium-2 processor."**

This statement implies that **the Itanium-2 processor is used as a benchmark for the model's accuracy**. The fact that the model performs well when validated against Itanium-2 suggests that the authors **view it as a relevant and valuable processor for their research**.

While the article doesn't explicitly praise Itanium-2, the **use of the processor as a benchmark and the positive validation results** indicate a **neutral to slightly positive sentiment** towards the Itanium architecture.

**Therefore, the sentiment score would be [0] - Neutral.**  The article uses Itanium-2 as a benchmark without explicitly expressing strong opinions, either positive or negative, about the architecture itself.

2006-01-01 - Whole-program optimization of global variable layout

Article:
On machines with high-performance processors, the memory system continues to be a performance bottleneck. Compilers insert prefetch operations and reorder data accesses to improve locality, but increasingly seek to modify an application's data layout to reduce cache miss and page fault penalties. In this paper we discuss Global Variable Layout (GVL), an optimization of the placement of entire static global data objects in the binary. We describe two practical methods for GVL in the HP-UX Integrity optimizing compiler for the Itanium  architecture. The first layout strategy relies on profile feedback, collaboratively employing the compiler, the linker and a pre-link tool to facilitate reordering. The second strategy uses whole-program analysis to drive data layout decisions, and does not require the use of a dynamic profile. We give a detailed description of our implementation and evaluate its performance for the SPEC integer benchmark programs, as well as for a large commercial database application.

## Analysis of the Article's Sentiment Towards Itanium:

The article focuses on **optimizing memory performance** in high-performance processors. This is achieved through a technique called **Global Variable Layout (GVL)**, which aims to improve data locality by strategically placing global variables within the binary. The article specifically discusses two methods for implementing GVL:

1. **Profile-based GVL:** This method leverages profiling data to inform the layout decisions, involving a collaborative effort between the compiler, linker, and a pre-link tool.
2. **Whole-program analysis GVL:** This method eliminates the need for dynamic profiling by relying on static analysis of the entire program to optimize the data layout.

The article's primary focus is on **improving memory performance** on high-performance processors. The mention of Itanium is **contextual**, highlighting the architecture as the target platform for the GVL techniques. **Itanium's memory system is implicitly acknowledged as a performance bottleneck**, justifying the need for optimization strategies like GVL. 

**However, the article does not express any explicit criticism or praise towards Itanium.** The focus remains on the optimization technique and its potential to improve performance regardless of the specific architecture. 

Therefore, while the article indirectly acknowledges the memory performance challenges faced by Itanium, it does not offer any direct commentary on the architecture itself.

2007-01-01 - A magnetoelectronic register file cell for a self-checkpointing microprocessor

Article:
A self-checkpointing microprocessor periodically copies the state of the currently executing program to on-chip non-volatile storage, allowing it to resume execution of the program at the last checkpoint after a power supply interruption or shutdown. In this paper, we present a register file cell for a self-checkpointing microprocessor that integrates a magnetoelectronic non-volatile memory cell into a register cell similar to the one used in the Itanium 2 microprocessor. Our design allows the contents of each bit in the register file to be checkpointed simultaneously, reducing the time required to take a checkpoint to a few clock cycles, without compromising the performance of the register file during normal read and write operations. Because the area of the base register file cell is determined by the wiring tracks it requires, adding self-checkpointing to the cell only increases its area by 6%. Similarly, adding self-checkpointing has effectively no impact on the cell's performance, only increasing read and write times from 299 to 300 ps, even when the additional load on the bit lines from the larger cells is considered.

2007-01-01 - Abiego: A function outlining and partial inlining framework

Article:
Frequently invoked large functions are common in non-numeric applications. These large functions present challenges to modern compilers not only because they require more time and resources at compilation time, but also because they may prevent optimizations such as function inlining. Often large portions of the code in a hot function fhost are executed much less frequently than fhost itself. Partial inlining is a natural solution to the problems caused by including cold code segments that are seldom executed into hot functions that are frequently invoked. When applying partial inlining, a compiler outlines cold statements from a hot function fhost. After outlining, fhost becomes smaller and thus can be easily inlined. This paper presents Ablego, a framework for function outlining and partial inlining that includes several innovations: (1) an abstract-syntax-tree-based analysis and transformation to form cold regions for outlining; (2) a set of flexible heuristics to control the aggressiveness of function outlining; (3) several possible function outlining strategies; (4) explicit variable spilling, a new technique that overcomes negative side-effects of function outlining. With the proper strategy, partial inlining improves performance by up to 5.75%. A performance study also suggests that partial inlining's effect on enabling more aggressive inlining is limited. The performance improvement from partial inlining actually comes from better code placement and better code generation. Copyright  2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article Regarding Itanium

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on the optimization technique of "partial inlining" for compilers. This technique aims to address the performance challenges presented by large, frequently invoked functions in non-numeric applications. The authors introduce a framework called Abiego, which implements partial inlining by:

1. **Outlining cold code:** Identifying and extracting infrequently executed code segments from hot (frequently executed) functions.
2. **Enabling inlining:** Making the remaining hot function smaller and thus more amenable to function inlining by the compiler.
3. **Managing side effects:** Addressing potential negative consequences of outlining, such as variable spilling.

The goal of the article is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Abiego for improving performance by reducing code size and enabling more efficient code optimization.

**Mention of Itanium:**

While the article does mention Itanium as a target platform for their performance study, the focus remains on the general concept of partial inlining and the Abiego framework. The article does not explicitly discuss Itanium's strengths or weaknesses, nor does it offer any specific insights into Itanium's architecture or performance characteristics.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article mentions Itanium solely as a platform for evaluating the performance of Abiego. It does not express any positive or negative sentiments towards Itanium. The authors simply use it as a benchmark for demonstrating the potential benefits of their proposed optimization technique. 

**Sentiment Score:**

[0] - Neutral 

**Conclusion:**

The article's primary focus is on the general concept of partial inlining and its implementation through the Abiego framework. Itanium is merely used as a test platform for showcasing the performance improvements achieved by their approach. The article does not express any sentiment towards Itanium, positive or negative.

2007-01-01 - Applying code specialization to FFT libraries for integral parameters

Article:
Code specialization is an approach that can be used to improve the sequence of optimizations to be performed by the compiler. The performance of code after specialization may vary, depending upon the structure of the application. For FFT libraries, the specialization of code with different parameters may cause an increase in code size, thereby impacting overall behavior of applications executing in environment with small instruction caches. In this article, we propose a new approach for specializing FFT code that can be effectively used to improve performance while limiting the code increase by incorporating dynamic specialization. Our approach makes use of a static compile time analysis and adapts a single version of code to multiple values through runtime specialization. This technique has been applied to different FFT libraries over Itanium IA-64 platform using ice compiler v 9.0. For highly efficient libraries, we are able to achieve speedup of more than 80% with small increase in code size.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. .

2007-01-01 - Challenges for formal verification in industrial setting

Article:
Commercial competition is forcing computer companies to get better products to market more rapidly, and therefore the time for validation is shrinking relative to the complexity of microprocessor designs. Improving time-to-market performance cannot be solved by just growing the size of design and validation teams. Design process automation is increasing, and the adoption of more rigorous methods, including formal verification, is unavoidable because for achieving the quality demanded by the marketplace. Intel is one of the strongest promoters of the use of formal methods across all phases of the design development. Intel's design teams use high-level modeling of protocols and algorithms, formal verification of floatingpoint libraries, design exploration systems based on formal methods, full proofs and property verification of RTL specifications, and equivalence checking to verify that transistor-level schematics correspond to their RTL specifications. Even with the best effort to adopt the progress in formal methods quickly, there is a large gap between an idea published at a conference and a development of a tool that can be used on industrial-sized designs. These tools and methods need to scale well, be stable during a multi-year design effort, and be able to support efficient debugging. The use of formal methods on a live design must allow for ongoing changes in the specification and the design. The methodology must be flexible enough to permit new design features, such as scan and power-down logic, soft error detection, etc. In this paper, I will share my experience with the formal verification of the floating-point unit on an Itanium(R) microprocessor design and point out how it may influence future microprocessor-design projects.

## Analysis of Sentiment towards Itanium:

The article focuses on characterizing the performance of the TPC-H benchmark, a standard database workload, on an Itanium II processor. The goal is to understand the processor's behavior under this workload to inform future database optimization and architecture design for next-generation processors.

The article highlights two key findings:

1. **Memory Stall Time:** The authors found that the majority of memory stall time is caused by cache misses, specifically in the first-level instruction cache (L1) and third-level data cache (L3). This suggests that the Itanium II processor struggles with memory access, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks.
2. **Index Impact:** They observed that using indexes significantly reduces L3 data cache misses but leads to a slight increase in branch prediction misprediction rates. This suggests a trade-off: indexes improve data retrieval but potentially increase the computational overhead for instruction execution.

While the authors don't explicitly state positive or negative sentiment towards Itanium, the focus on cache misses and branch prediction mispredictions suggests an awareness of the processor's potential weaknesses.  

**Therefore, the sentiment of the article towards Itanium is: **

**[-1] - Signs of critique (Sceptical of Itanium, or indirectly negative)**

The article points to specific areas of the Itanium II processor where performance limitations were observed. This is indicative of a critical approach towards the processor, focusing on its limitations rather than its strengths.

2007-01-01 - COBRA: An adaptive runtime binary optimization framework for multithreaded applications

Article:
This paper presents COBRA (Continuous Binary Re-Adaptation), a runtime binary optimization framework, for multithreaded applications. It is currently implemented on Itanium 2 based SMP and cc-NUMA systems. Using OpenMP NAS parallel benchmark, we show how COBRA can adaptively choose appropriate optimizations according to observed changing runtime program behavior. Coherent cache misses caused by true/false data sharing often limit the scalability of multithreaded applications. This paper shows that COBRA can significantly improve the performance of some applications parallelized with OpenMP, by reducing the aggressiveness of data prefetching and by using exclusive hints for prefetch instructions. For example, we show that COBRA can improve the performance of OpenMP NAS parallel benchmarks up to 68%, with an average of 17.5% on the SGI Altix cc-NUMA system.  2007 IEEE. .

2007-01-01 - Compiler optimizations for fault tolerance software checking

Article:
Dramatic increases in the number of transistors that can be integrated on a chip will make the hardware more susceptible to radiation-induced transient errors. High-end architectures like the IBM mainframes, HP NonStop or mission-critical computers are likely to include several hardware-intensive fault tolerance techniques. However, the commodity chips which are cost- and energy-constrained, will need a more flexible and inexpensive technology for error detection. Software approaches can play a major role for this sector of the market because they need little hardware modification and can be tailored to fit different requirements of reliability and performance. Current software approaches address the problem by replicating the instructions and adding checking instructions to compare the results [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. These checking instructions account for a significant fraction of the added overhead. In this work we propose a set of compiler optimizations to identify and remove redundant checks from the replicated code. Two checks are considered redundant if they check the same variable. In this case, it is possible to remove the check that appears first during execution so that an error will be detected when the second check executes. However, determining how much a check can be delayed is tricky. If we delay it too little, there is little room for optimization. If we delay it too much, the errors will propagate to undesired places and result in segmentation faults, corrupted memory, wrong execution path, or undetected errors across checkpoints. We consider that how much the error detection can be delayed will depend on the recovery mechanism supported by the hardware or the system. As long as checks are not delayed beyond synchronization checkpoints, the system will be able to properly recover. With our techniques the user can define what are the synchronization checkpoints based on the hardware support for recovery. In this work we evaluate two levels of hardware or system support: memory without support for checkpointing and rollback, where memory is guaranteed to not be corrupted with wrong values and memory with low-cost support for checkpointing and rollback. We also consider the situation where register file is protected with parity or ECC, such as Intel Itanium, Sun UltraSPARC and IBM Power4-6 because software implementations can take advantage of this hardware feature and reduce some of the replicated instructions. We have evaluated our approach using LLVM as our compiler infrastructure and PIN for fault injection. Our experimental results with Spec benchmarks on a Pentium 4 show that in the case where memory is guaranteed not to be corrupted, performance improves by an average 6.2%. With more support for checkpoint performance improves by an average 14.7%. A software fault tolerant system that takes advantage of the register safe platforms improves by an average 16.0%. Fault injection experiments show that our techniques do not decrease fault coverage, although they slightly increase the number of segmentation faults.  2007 IEEE. .

2007-01-01 - Development of parallel density functional program using distributed matrix to calculate all-electron canonical wavefunction of large molecules

Article:
We developed a new parallel density-functional canonical molecular-orbital program for large molecules based on the resolution of the identity method. In this study, all huge matrices were decomposed and saved to the distributed local memory. The routines of the analytical molecular integrals and numerical integrals of the exchange-correlation terms were parallelized using the single program multiple data method. A conventional linear algebra matrix library, ScaLAPACK, was used for matrix operations, such as diagonalization, multiplication, and inversion. Anderson's mixing method was adopted to accelerate the self-consistent field (SCF) convergence. Using this program, we calculated the canonical wavefunctions of a 306-residue protein, insulin hexamer (26,790 orbitals), and a 133-residue protein, interleukin (11,909 orbitals) by the direct-SCF method. In regard to insulin hexamer, the total parallelization efficiency of the first SCF iteration was estimated to be 82% using 64 Itanium 2 processors connected at 3.2 GB/s (SGI Altix3700), and the calculation successfully converged at the 17-th SCF iteration. By adopting the update method, the computational time of the first and the final SCF loops was 229 min and 156 min, respectively. The whole computational time including the calculation before the SCF loop was 2 days and 17 h. This study put the calculations of the canonical wavefunction of 30,000 orbitals to practical use.  2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. .

## Sentiment Analysis: Itanium in the 2007 Article

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on the development of a novel parallel density-functional canonical molecular-orbital program for large molecules. This program leverages the "resolution of identity method" and distributed local memory to handle the immense computational demands of calculating the electronic structure of large molecules. The primary goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the program, particularly in tackling the challenging calculations for proteins with thousands of orbitals.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article mentions Itanium specifically in the context of their computational setup: "64 Itanium 2 processors connected at 3.2 GB/s (SGI Altix3700)." The authors then report a "total parallelization efficiency of the first SCF iteration" of 82%. 

While the article doesn't explicitly praise Itanium, the mention of 82% efficiency suggests a positive outcome. This efficiency figure is a direct measure of the performance achieved with the Itanium-based system.  It indicates that the system was effective in achieving high levels of parallelism, which is a key factor in handling the computational burden of their molecular calculations.

**Sentiment Score:**

Based on the above analysis, the article doesn't express a strongly positive or negative opinion about Itanium. The focus is on the computational performance of the program, and Itanium is merely a component of the system used. While the achieved parallelization efficiency of 82% is positive, it is presented as a technical result, not a direct endorsement of the processor architecture.

**Therefore, the most fitting sentiment score is [0] - Neutral.**

2007-01-01 - Iterative compilation with kernel exploration

Article:
The increasing complexity of hardware mechanisms for recent processors makes high performance code generation very challenging. One of the main issue for high performance is the optimization of memory accesses. General purpose compilers, with no knowledge of the application context and approximate memory model, seem inappropriate for this task. Combining application-dependent optimizations on the source code and exploration of optimization parameters as it is achieved with ATLAS, has been shown as one way to improve performance. Yet, hand-tuned codes such as in the MKL library still outperform ATLAS with an important speed-up and some effort has to be done in order to bridge the gap between performance obtained by automatic and manual optimizations. In this paper, a new iterative compilation approach for the generation of high performance codes is proposed. This approach is not applicationdependent, compared to ATLAS. The idea is to separate the memory optimization phase from the computation optimization phase. The first step automatically finds all possible decompositions of the code into kernels. With datasets that fit into the cache and simplified memory accesses, these kernels are simpler to optimize, either with the compiler, at source level, or with a dedicated code generator. The best decomposition is then found by a model-guided approach, performing on the source code the required memory optimizations. Exploration of optimization sequences and their parameters is achieved with a meta-compilation language, X language. The first results on linear algebra codes for Itanium show that the performance obtained reduce the gap with those of highly optimized hand-tuned codes.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. .

Article:
A new software code for computing selected eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix is described. The eigenvalues are either the smallest or those closest to some specified target, which may be in the interior of the spectrum. The underlying algorithm combines the Jacobi-Davidson method with efficient multilevel incomplete LU (ILU) preconditioning. Key features are modest memory requirements and robust convergence to accurate solutions. Parameters needed for incomplete LU preconditioning are automatically computed and may be updated at run time depending on the convergence pattern.

2007-01-01 - Leveraging predicated execution for multimedia processing

Article:
Modern compression standards such as H.264, DivX, or VC-1 provide astonishing quality at the costs of steadily increasing processing requirements. Therefore, efficient solutions for mobile multimedia devices have to effectively leverage instruction level parallelism (ILP), which is often achieved by the deployment of EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) architectures. A characteristical architectural feature to increase the available ILP in the presence of control flow is predicated execution. Compilers targeting those hardware platforms are responsible to carefully convert control flow into conditional/predicated instructions - a process called if-conversion. We describe an effective if-conversion algorithm for the CHILI - a novel hardware architecture specifically designed for digital video processing and mobile multimedia consumer electronic. Several architectural characteristics such as the lack of branch prediction units, large delay slots, and the provided predication model are significantly different from previous work, typically aiming mainstream architectures such as Intel Itanium. The algorithm has been implemented for an optimizing compiler based on LLVM. Experimental results using a cycle accurate simulator for the well known benchmark suite MiBench and several multimedia codecs show a speed improvement of about 18% on average. On the same programs, our compiler achieves a speedup of 21% in comparison to the existing code generator based on gcc.  2007 IEEE. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article towards Itanium:

**Article Topic/Goal:**

The article focuses on optimizing multimedia processing for mobile devices by leveraging predicated execution, a technique used in Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) architectures. It specifically introduces a novel if-conversion algorithm designed for the CHILI architecture, a hardware platform tailored for digital video processing. The goal is to improve the efficiency of multimedia codecs on mobile devices by maximizing instruction-level parallelism.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article doesn't explicitly praise or criticize Itanium. Instead, it implicitly contrasts the CHILI architecture with Itanium by highlighting the differences in their architectural features. The authors explicitly mention that the CHILI architecture lacks branch prediction units, has large delay slots, and utilizes a different predication model compared to Itanium. 

This implies that the CHILI architecture is designed differently from Itanium and that the authors considered these differences significant enough to mention.  While the authors don't directly state that these differences are positive or negative for CHILI, the fact that they emphasize them suggests that they are relevant to the performance and efficiency of the CHILI architecture.

**Conclusion:**

The article's focus is on the CHILI architecture and its unique features for multimedia processing. The comparison with Itanium is indirect, highlighting the differences between the two architectures. This leads to a neutral sentiment towards Itanium, as the article doesn't express explicit opinions about its strengths or weaknesses.

2007-01-01 - Loop optimization using hierarchical compilation and kernel decomposition

Article:
The increasing complexity of hardware features for recent processors makes high performance code generation very challenging. In particular, several optimization targets have to be pursued simultaneously (minimizing L1/L2/L3/TLB misses and maximizing instruction level parallelism). Very often, these optimization goals impose different and contradictory constraints on the transformations to be applied. We propose a new hierarchical compilation approach for the generation of high performance code relying on the use of state-of-the-art compilers. This approach is not application-dependent and do not require any assembly hand-coding. It relies on the decomposition of the original loop nest into simpler kernels, typically 1D to 2D loops, much simpler to optimize. We successfully applied this approach to optimize dense matrix muliply primitives (not only for the square case but to the more general rectangular cases) and convolution. The performance of the optimized codes on Itanium 2 and Pentium 4 architectures outperforms ATLAS and in most cases, matches hand-tuned vendor libraries (e.g. MKL).  2007 IEEE. .

2007-01-01 - OpenMP implementation of SPICE3 circuit simulator

Article:
In this paper, we describe our experience of creating an OpenMP implementation of the SPICE3 circuit simulator program. Given the irregular patterns of access to dynamic data structures in the SPICE code, a parallelization using current standard OpenMP directives is impossible without major rewriting of the original program. The aim of this work is to present a case study showing the development of a shared memory parallel code with minimum effort. We present two implementations, one with minimal code modification and one without modification to the original SPICE3 program using Intel's taskq construct. We also discuss the results of the case study in terms of what future compiler tools may be needed to help OpenMP application developers with similar porting goals. Our experiments using SPICE3, based on SRAM model simulation, were compiled by the SUN compiler running on a SunFire V880 UltraSPARC-III 750 MHz and by the Intel icc compiler running on both an IBM Itanium with four CPUs and Intel Xeon of two processors machines.

We present a global instruction scheduler based on integer linear programming (ILP) that was implemented experimentally in the Intel Itanium product compiler. It features virtually the full scale of known EPIC scheduling optimizations, more than its heuristic counterpart in the compiler, GCS, and in contrast to the latter it computes optimal solutions in the form of schedules with minimal length. Due to our highly efficient ILP model it can solve problem instances with 500-750 instructions, and in combination with region scheduling we are able to schedule routines of arbitrary size. In experiments on five SPEC CPU2006 integer benchmarks, ILP-scheduled code exhibits a 32% schedule length advantage and a 10% runtime speedup over GCS-scheduled code, at the highest compiler optimization levels typically used for SPEC submissions. We further study the impact of different code motion classes, region sizes, and target microarchitectures, gaining insights into the nature of the global instruction scheduling problem.  2007 IEEE. .

2007-01-01 - Performance and security lessons learned from virtualizing the alpha processor

Article:
Virtualization has become much more important throughout the computer industry both to improve security and to support multiple workloads on the same hardware with effective isolation between those workloads. The most widely used chip architecture, the Intel and AMD x86 processors, have begun to support virtualization, but the initial implementations show some limitations. This paper examines the virtualization properties of the Alpha architecture with particular emphasis on features that improve performance and security. It shows how the Alpha's features of PALcode, address space numbers, software handling of translation buffer misses, lack of used and modified bits, and secure handling of unpredictable results all contribute to making virtualization of the Alpha particularly easy. The paper then compares the virtual architecture of the Alpha with Intel's and AMD's virtualization approaches for x86. It also comments briefly on Intel's virtualization technology for Itanium, IBM's zSeries and pSeries hypervisors and Sun's UltraSPARC virtualization. It particularly identifies some differences between translation buffers on x86 and translation buffers on VAX and Alpha that can have adverse performance consequences. Copyright 2007 ACM. .

2007-01-01 - Performance driven data cache prefetching in a dynamic software optimization system

Article:
Software or hardware data cache prefetching is an efficient way to hide cache miss latency. However effectiveness of the issued prefetches have to be monitored in order to maximize their positive impact while minimizing their negative impact on performance. In previous proposed dynamic frameworks, the monitoring scheme is either achieved using processor performance counters or using specific hardware. In this work, we propose a prefetching strategy which does not use any specific hardware component or processor performance counter. Our dynamic framework wants to be portable on any modern processor architecture providing at least a prefetch instruction. Opportunity and effectiveness of prefetching loads is simply guided by the time spent to effectively obtain the data. Every load of a program is monitored periodically and can be either associated to a dynamically inserted prefetch instruction or not. It can be associated to a prefetch instruction at some disjoint periods of the whole program run as soon as it is efficient. Our framework has been implemented for Itanium-2 machines. It involves several dynamic instrumentations of the binary code whose overhead is limited to only 4% on average. On a large set of benchmarks, our system is able to speed up some programs by 2% - 143%. Copyright 2007 ACM. .

2007-01-01 - Propagation of UWB pulses on metal strips printed on semiconductor dielectrics

Article:
The interaction of ultra-wideband pulses propagating on a semiconductor substrate is analysed without solving the charge dynamic equations. This study demonstrates the systematic approach for selecting semiconductor parameters and their significance in the practical design of high speed microstrip interconnects. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a comprehensive and conceptual study of EMP interaction with semiconductor dielectrics has been performed. The comparison of waveforms on single and coupled lines elucidates the mechanisms of pulse distortion on semiconductor substrates. However, the realization of the dielectric relaxation is studied by changing the doping concentrations of the substrate. Moreover, the evolution of currents for different conductivities illustrates the realization of the doping concentration in a semiconductor. Furthermore, the study on layered substrates with different doping concentrations and relative permittivities demonstrates the fidelity of waveforms on the source line and significantly weak coupling to the victim line. This analysis is a first step towards the full-fledged self-consistent simulations of EMP interaction with the physical model of semiconductor devices.

2007-01-01 - Rectangular full packed format for LAPACK algorithms timings on several computers

Article:
We describe a new data format for storing triangular and symmetric matrices called RFP (Rectangular Full Packed). The standard two dimensional arrays of Fortran and C (also known as full format) that are used to store triangular and symmetric matrices waste nearly half the storage space but provide high performance via the use of level 3 BLAS. Standard packed format arrays fully utilize storage (array space) but provide low performance as there are no level 3 packed BLAS. We combine the good features of packed and full storage using RFP format to obtain high performance using L3 (level 3) BLAS as RFP is full format. Also, RFP format requires exactly the same minimal storage as packed format. Each full and/or packed symmetric/triangular routine becomes a single new RFP routine. We present LAPACK routines for Cholesky factorization, inverse and solution computation in RFP format to illustrate this new work and to describe its performance on the IBM, Itanium, NEC, and SUN platforms. Performance of RFP versus LA-PACK full routines for both serial and SMP parallel processing is about the same while using half the storage, Performance is roughly one to a factor of 33 for serial and one to a factor of 100 for SMP parallel times faster than LAPACK packed routines. Existing LAPACK routines and vendor LAPACK routines were used in the serial and the SMP parallel study, respectively. In both studies vendor L3 BLAS were used.

## Analyzing the Sentiment of the Article towards Itanium

The article focuses on introducing a new data format called RFP (Rectangular Full Packed) for storing triangular and symmetric matrices. The core goal is to improve performance in matrix operations by combining the benefits of both full and packed storage formats. The authors achieve this by utilizing level 3 BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) which are known for their efficiency in full format storage.

The article mentions the performance of RFP on several platforms, including IBM, Itanium, NEC, and SUN. However, the article **does not specifically comment on the performance of Itanium in relation to the other platforms**. It simply lists Itanium as one of the platforms where the RFP format was tested and provides performance data for the RFP routines on all mentioned platforms.  

**Therefore, the article does not express any particular sentiment towards Itanium.** The authors are primarily focused on highlighting the advantages of the RFP format and presenting its performance across different platforms, without explicitly comparing or ranking them.

The technology of parameters recovery is very important for researchers in the area of designing of binary translation systems. It has much to do with architecture, compiler, operating system, and many other aspects. The recovery of floating-point parameters is more complex, compared with the recovery of parameters in other types. This paper presents a new approach to floating-point parameters recovery based on the concept of parameter slot. It makes the recovery of parameters easy and especially precise to implement. This method has been used in the design of a binary translation system ITA, which is designed for a 64-bit architecture Itanium. Through the test using the programs in SPEC2000, this method is proved to be sound and effective in the ITA translation system. .

2007-01-01 - Three-dimensional bursting and parallel computing

Article:
This work presents a mathematical model and its parallel implementation via two parallel paradigms for the simulation of three-dimensional bursting phenomena. The mathematical model consists of four nonlinearly coupled partial differential equations and includes fast and slow subsystems. The differential equations have been discretized by means of a linearly implicit finite difference method in equally spaced grids. The resulting system of equations at each time level has been solved by means of an optimized preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The proposed mathematical model has been implemented via (i) a message passing paradigm based on the standard MPI and (ii) a shared address space paradigm based on SPMD OpenMP. The two implementations have been evaluated on three current parallel architectures, namely, a cluster of dual Xeon, a SGI Altix 3700 Bx2 system based on Itanium, and a Sun Fire E15K. It is shown that for the conditions reported here, the nonlinear dynamics of the three-dimensional bursting phenomena exhibits four different regimes, charachterized by asynchronous, synchronous, and then asynchronous oscillations before a quiescent state is reached. In addition, the fast system reaches steady state in much less time than the slow variables. It is also shown that both parallel pradigms lead to similar scalability on all considered platforms.  2007 by Begell House, Inc. .

2007-01-01 - What is Itanium Memory Consistency from the Programmer's Point of View?

Article:
A programmer-centric model describes the memory consistency rules of amultiprocessor as a collection, one for each processor, of 'views' of instructions and some agreements between these views. It also requires the natural notion of validity: the value read from a shared memory location is the one that was most recently stored, according to a given view. This allows reasoning about programs at a non-operational level in the natural way, not obscured by the implementation details of the underlying architecture. In this paper, we formulate a programmer-centric description of the memory consistency model provided by the Itanium architecture. However, our definition is not tight. We provide two very similar definitions and show that the specification of the Itanium memory model lies between the two. These two definitions are motivated by slightly different implementations of load-acquire instructions. A further entertainment of a handful of other load-acquire rules leads us to question whether the specification of the Itanium memory order [Intel Corporation. A formal specification of the intel itanium processor family memory ordering. http://www.intel.com/, Oct 2002] is indeed faithful to the Itanium architecture intentions.  2007 Elsevier B.V.

2008-01-01 - A hash-TLB approach for MMU virtualization in Xen/IA64

Article:
With advances in hardware-assisted full virtualization technologies, system virtualization based on the virtual machine monitor (VMM) has received much recent attention. Using the Xen/IA64 hardware virtual machine implemented on Intel Virtualization Technology for Itanium (VT-i), we investigate the design of a virtual software hash translation lookaside buffer (TLB) based on the virtual hash page table (VHPT). Experimental results show that the proposed design can significantly improve the performance of the hardware virtual machine of Xen/IA64. Our contributions are the following. First, we design and implement in the VMM a virtual hash TLB algorithm to optimize the system performance of VT-i guest virtual machines. Second, we quantify experimentally the performance benefits of the hash TLB for VT-i guest virtual machines and analyze the performance impact of the software VHPT walker with the hash TLB algorithm. Lastly, we present experiments to verify, in an SMP virtual machine system environment, the superior scalability of the hash TLB approach. 2008 IEEE. .

2008-01-01 - An effective automated approach to specialization of code

Article:
Application performance is heavily dependent on the compiler optimizations. Modern compilers rely largely on the information made available to them at the time of compilation. In this regard, specializing the code according to input values is an effective way to communicate necessary information to the compiler. However, the static specialization suffers from possible code explosion and dynamic specialization requires runtime compilation activities that may degrade the overall performance of the application. This article proposes an automated approach for specializing code that is able to address both the problems of code size increase and the overhead of runtime activities. We first obtain optimized code through specialization performed at static compile time and then generate a template that can work for a large set of values through runtime specialization. Our experiments show significant improvement for different SPEC benchmarks on Itanium-II(IA-64) and Pentium-IV processors using icc and gcc compilers.  2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. .

2008-01-01 - Analyzing mutual influences of high performance computing programs on SGI Altix 3700 and 4700 systems with PARbench

Article:
Nowadays, most high performance computing systems run in multiprogramming mode with several user programs simultaneously utilizing the available CPUs. Even though most current SMP systems are implemented as ccNUMA to reduce the bottleneck of main memory access, the user programs still compete in different ways for resources and influence the scheduler decisions with their generated load. This paper presents the investigation results of the SGI Altix 3700Bx2 of the TU-Dresden and its successor system the Altix 4700 with the PARbench system. The PARbench system is a multiprogramming and multithreading benchmark system, which enables the user to assess the system behaviour under typical production work load and identify bottlenecks and scheduling problems. The Altix 3700 and 4700 with their directory based ccNUMA architecture are the largest SMP systems on the market and promise a high scalability combined with a good isolation of the several system nodes. Several tests validates these promised features and analyzes the connection network and the utilized Intel Itanium 2 Madison (Altix 3700Bx2) and dual core Itanium 2 Montecito (Altix 4700) CPUs. The paper will also show practical problems of the shared system bus by two CPUs each in the 3700 system and compare these situation with the internally shared system bus of the dual core CPUs in the 4700 system. Further tests examine the load balancing behavior and it's consequences to OpenMP parallelized programs under overload.  2008 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved. . Keywords:;

## Analyzing the Sentiment towards Itanium

The article's primary goal is to investigate the performance of SGI Altix 3700Bx2 and Altix 4700 systems, both of which utilize Itanium processors. The researchers aim to understand how these systems behave under typical high-performance computing workloads, focusing on the effects of multiprogramming and multithreading on system performance. They use the PARbench system to simulate realistic work conditions and analyze the impact of resource contention, scheduling decisions, and system architecture on overall performance. 

**Key points regarding Itanium:**

* **Positive:** 
    * The article highlights the "high scalability" of the Altix systems, which are based on Itanium processors. This suggests a positive perception of Itanium's performance capabilities.
    * The article mentions the "good isolation of the several system nodes" in the Altix systems, which again points to a positive view of the architecture and its ability to handle concurrent workloads efficiently.
    * The paper focuses on comparing the performance of the Itanium 2 Madison processor in the Altix 3700Bx2 with the dual-core Itanium 2 Montecito in the Altix 4700. This suggests that the researchers are interested in exploring the advancements and improvements in Itanium technology. 

* **Neutral:**
    * While the paper discusses the "shared system bus" and its impact on performance, it does not explicitly attribute any shortcomings to the Itanium processors themselves. Instead, it focuses on the architectural differences between the 3700 and 4700 systems.
    * The paper mentions potential "scheduling problems" that could occur under high load, but these are presented as general system challenges rather than specific issues related to Itanium.

* **Negative:**
    * The article mentions "practical problems of the shared system bus" in the Altix 3700 system, which might indirectly imply a potential weakness in the older Itanium 2 Madison processor.
    *  The paper notes that the 4700 system with dual-core Itanium 2 Montecito has an "internally shared system bus," suggesting that the shared system bus in the 3700 might be a limiting factor. However, this is more a comparison between different architectures than a direct critique of Itanium.

**Overall Sentiment:**

While the article does mention some limitations related to the shared system bus in the older Altix 3700 system, it overall presents a neutral to slightly positive outlook on Itanium. The paper acknowledges its scalability, isolation capabilities, and focuses on analyzing its performance in various scenarios. It also compares the older Itanium 2 Madison with the newer dual-core Montecito, highlighting potential advancements in the technology.

The article mentions Itanium only in the context of a performance comparison.  The authors use an Itanium 2 CPU as a benchmark against which they measure the performance of their FPGA-based engine. They highlight the impressive speedup achieved by the FPGA engine, achieving 35 to 58 times faster performance than the 1.5 GHz Itanium 2 CPU.

**Analysis:**

While the article does not explicitly criticize Itanium, the focus on the significantly faster performance of the FPGA solution implicitly suggests that Itanium is not the ideal choice for this particular task. The emphasis on the speedup achieved by the FPGA-based engine inherently implies that the Itanium CPU falls short in this area.

**Sentiment Score:**

Based on the above analysis, the article exhibits **[ -1 ] - Signs of critique.** While not directly negative, the comparison implicitly suggests that the FPGA solution offers superior performance, highlighting Itanium's limitations in this specific context.

2008-01-01 - Construction of speculative optimization algorithms

Article:
In modern processors, instructions to perform operations are often produced before it becomes known that this is required. Such an expedient, which is called speculative execution, helps to reveal parallelism at the instruction level. In the EPIC architectures, the speculative execution is completely controlled by the compiler, which makes it possible to avoid using complex hardware mechanisms for supporting speculative instruction production. Moreover, the idea of the speculative execution can be used by the compiler in machine-independent optimizations. The paper describes a scheme of construction of the speculative optimization that is based on the selection of properties of the control flow and data flow that are important from the optimization standpoint and on the estimation of the probabilities of their fulfillment. The probabilities found are used for searching and constructing advantageous speculative and bookkeeping transformations. For optimizations that include only speculative movements of instructions upwards along the control flow graph, on the basis of the suggested scheme, a method has been developed that includes algorithms for finding probabilities of data and control dependences, for estimating benefit of speculative movements, and for constructing a recovery code. On the basis of this method, an algorithm for the speculative scheduling of instructions for the Intel Itanium architecture has been developed and implemented. Specific features of its implementation and experimental results are described.  2008 MAIK Nauka. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article Regarding Itanium

The article focuses on the concept of "speculative execution," a technique used in modern processors to improve performance by executing instructions before it's certain they'll be needed. The author explores how this concept can be leveraged by compilers to optimize code, particularly in architectures like EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing), where the compiler controls the speculative execution. 

The article then delves into the development of a scheme for constructing speculative optimization algorithms. This scheme involves identifying key control flow and data flow properties for optimization and estimating the probabilities of their fulfillment. These probabilities are then used to guide the search for advantageous speculative transformations. The author outlines a specific method for speculative instruction movements upwards along the control flow graph, which includes algorithms for calculating data and control dependencies, estimating the benefits of speculative movements, and constructing recovery code.

Importantly, the article mentions that this method has been used to develop an algorithm for speculative instruction scheduling specifically for the **Intel Itanium architecture**. This implementation is described as a **specific feature** and experimental results are mentioned.  

**Analysis of Sentiment:**

While the article doesn't explicitly praise or criticize Itanium, it focuses on the *implementation* of a specific algorithm on this architecture. This suggests a level of interest and engagement with Itanium, highlighting its relevance as a target platform for the discussed optimization techniques.

2008-01-01 - Correctly rounded multiplication by arbitrary precision constants

Article:
We introduce an algorithm for multiplying a floating-point number  by a constant C that is not exactly representable in floating-point arithmetic. Our algorithm uses a multiplication and a fused multiply and add instruction. Such instructions are available in some modern processors such as the IBM Power PC and the Intel/HP Itanium. We give three methods for checking whether, for a given value of C and a given floating-point format, our algorithm returns a correctly rounded result for any . When it does not, some of our methods return all the values  for which the algorithm fails. We generalize our study to the case where a wider internal format is used for the intermediate calculations, which gives a fourth method. Our programs and some additional information (such as the case where an arbitrary nonbinary even radix is used), as well as examples of runs of our programs can be downloaded from http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/jean-michel.muller/ MultConstant.html.  2008 IEEE. .

2008-01-01 - Fast, frequency-based, integrated register allocation and instruction scheduling

Article:
Instruction scheduling and register allocation are two of the most important optimization phases in modern compilers as they have a significant impact on the quality of the generated code. Unfortunately, the objectives of these two optimizations are in conflict with one another. The instruction scheduler attempts to exploit instruction-level parallelism and requires many operands to be available in registers. On the other hand, the register allocator wants register pressure to be kept low so that the amount of spill code can be minimized. Currently these two phases are done separately, typically in three passes: prepass scheduling, register allocation and postpass scheduling. But this separation can lead to poor results. Previous works attempted to solve the phase-ordering problem by combining the instruction scheduler with graph-coloring-based register allocators. The latter tend to be computationally expensive. Linear-scan register allocators, on the other hand, are simple, fast and efficient. In this paper, we describe our effort to integrate instruction scheduling with a linear-scan allocator. Furthermore, our integrated optimizer is able to take advantage of execution frequencies obtained through profiling. Our integrated register allocator and instruction scheduler achieved good code quality with significantly reduced compilation times. On the SPEC2000 benchmarks running on a 900 MHz Itanium II, compared with Open IMPACT, we halved the time spent in instruction scheduling and register allocation with negligible impact on execution times.

## Analyzing the Sentiment Towards Itanium

This article focuses on **improving the efficiency of code generation in compilers**, specifically tackling the challenge of coordinating instruction scheduling and register allocation. The authors argue that traditional approaches, where these two phases are separated, can lead to suboptimal results. 

The primary contribution of the paper is introducing **an integrated approach that combines instruction scheduling with a linear-scan register allocator**. This integration aims to:

* **Improve code quality:** By optimizing these phases simultaneously, the authors achieve better instruction-level parallelism and minimize spill code, resulting in faster execution.
* **Reduce compilation time:** The integrated system is significantly faster than previous methods that relied on graph-coloring register allocators, which are known to be computationally expensive. 

**Regarding Itanium, the article mentions it only in the context of benchmarking their integrated approach.** The authors compare the performance of their system with Open IMPACT (a compiler for the Itanium architecture) on the SPEC2000 benchmark suite. They report that their integrated system achieved **negligible impact on execution times** while **halving the time spent on instruction scheduling and register allocation**. 

**Therefore, the article's sentiment towards Itanium is neutral.** While the authors mention Itanium as the platform for their benchmarking, their primary focus is not on evaluating the architecture itself but rather on showcasing the effectiveness of their optimization technique.

2008-01-01 - From speculation to security: Practical and efficient information flow tracking using speculative hardware

Article:
Dynamic information flow tracking (also known as taint tracking) is an appealing approach to combat various security attacks. However, the performance of applications can severely degrade without hardware support for tracking taints. This paper observes that information flow tracking can be efficiently emulated using deferred exception tracking in microprocessors supporting speculative execution. Based on this observation, we propose SHIFT, a low-overhead, software-based dynamic information flow tracking system to detect a wide range of attacks. The key idea is to treat tainted state (describing untrusted data) as speculative state (describing deferred exceptions). SHIFT leverages existing architectural support for speculative execution to track tainted state in registers and needs to instrument only load and store instructions to track tainted state in memory using a bitmap, which results in significant performance advantages. Moreover, by decoupling mechanisms for taint tracking from security policies, SHIFT can detect a wide range of exploits, including high-level semantic attacks. We have implemented SHIFT using the Itanium processor, which has support for deferred exceptions, and by modifying GCC to instrument loads and stores. A security assessment shows that SHIFT can detect both low-level memory corruption exploits as well as high-level semantic attacks with no false positives. Performance measurements show that SHIFT incurs about 1% overhead for server applications. The performance slowdown for SPEC-INT2000 is 2.81X and 2.27X for tracking at byte-level and word-level respectively. Minor architectural improvements to the Itanium processor (adding three simple instructions) can reduce the performance slowdown down to 2.32X and 1.8X for byte-level and word-level tracking, respectively.  2008 IEEE. .

2008-01-01 - Interprocedural speculative optimization of memory accesses to global variables

Article:
The discrepancy between processor and memory speed, also known as memory gap, is steadily increasing. This means that execution speed is more and more dominated by memory accesses. We investigate the use of globals, which reside inherently in memory, in standard applications and present an approach to reduce the number of memory accesses, thereby reducing the effect of the memory gap. Our approach can explicitly deal with uncertain information and, hence, optimize more aggressively with the help of speculative techniques while not changing the semantics of the optimized programs. We present an implementation of the proposed optimization in our compiler framework for the Intel Itanium and show that our techniques lead to an increased performance for the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks, thus showing that the impact of the memory gap can be effectively mitigated with advanced speculative optimization.  2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. .

In this paper we investigate the benefit of scheduling non-critical loads for a higher latency during software pipelining "Non-critical" denotes those loads that have sufficient slack in the cyclic data dependence graph so that increasing the scheduling distance to their first use can only increase the number of stages of the software pipeline, but should not increase the lengths of the individual stages, the initiation interval (II). The associated cost is in many cases negligible, but the memory stall reduction due to improved latency coverage and load clustering in the schedule can be considerable. We first analyze benefit and cost in theory and then present how we have implemented latency-tolerant pipelining experimentally in the Intel Itanium product compiler. A key component of the technique is the preselection of likely long-latency loads that is integrated into prefetching heuristics in the high-level optimizer. Only when applied selectively based on these prefetcher hints, the optimization gives the full benefit also without trip-count information from dynamic profiles. Experimental results show gains of up to 14%, with an average of 2.2%, in a wide range of SPEC CPU2000 and CPU2006 benchmarks. These gains were realized on top of best-performing compiler options typically used for SPEC submissions. Copyright 2008 ACM. .

## Analyzing the Sentiment towards Itanium

The article focuses on **improving the performance of software pipelining for the Intel Itanium processor**, specifically by optimizing load scheduling. The authors introduce a technique called "latency-tolerant pipelining" which aims to reduce memory stalls by strategically scheduling non-critical loads for later execution, taking advantage of the inherent latency in memory access. This allows the compiler to optimize the pipeline structure by increasing the number of stages without compromising the initiation interval (II), a crucial metric for performance.

The article highlights the **positive aspects of Itanium's architecture** by showcasing the potential for performance gains through the implementation of this optimization. The authors mention that the technique has been "implemented experimentally in the Intel Itanium product compiler" and that they achieved "gains of up to 14%, with an average of 2.2%, in a wide range of SPEC CPU2000 and CPU2006 benchmarks." These gains are **presented as positive outcomes** and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization in improving the overall performance of Itanium-based systems.

Furthermore, the authors emphasize that these gains were achieved on top of "best-performing compiler options typically used for SPEC submissions." This implies that the latency-tolerant pipelining technique offers **additional performance benefits beyond the already optimized compiler settings**, further supporting a positive sentiment towards Itanium's capabilities.

**Therefore, the overall sentiment of the article towards Itanium is positive.** The authors present the optimization as a successful implementation that enhances the performance of the Itanium platform.

**Sentiment Score: [1] - Somewhat Positive**

2008-01-01 - Mapping table based register file design and compiler optimization

Article:
Register file design is very important in high performance processor design. Register Stack and Register Stack Engine are effective ways to improve performance. Compiler optimizations are often driven by specific assumptions about the underlying architecture and implementation of the target machine. In this paper, we present our efforts to design and implement register file management mechanism-MTRM (Mapping Table-based Register Management) on EDSMT, which is a kind of SMT architecture based on IA-64. MTRM assigns a Mapping Table for each thread to mapping their logic registers to physic registers, which adds a middle level into Itanium's original rename mechanism. MTRM focused on supporting the effective sharing of registers in an EDSMT processor, using register renaming to permit multiple threads to share a single global register file. Existing hardware is effective at allocating physical registers;it has only limited ability to identify register deallocation points. Compile optimization is considered to deallocate dead registers, while Special Bit and Special Instruction are used as two effective ways. Simulation results indicate that these mechanisms can reduce register deallocation ineffciencies;in particular, on small register files, the best of the schemes attains speedups of up to 2.2 for some applications, and 1.8 on average. .

Article:
In this paper, we present a detailed case study of the optimizing implementation of a fundamental scientific kernel, matrix-vector multiplication, on FT64, which is the first 64-bit stream processor designed for scientific computing. The major novelties of our study are as follows. First, we develop four stream programs according to different stream organizations, involving dot product, row product, multi-dot product and multirow product approaches. Second the optimal strip size for partitioning the large matrix is put forward based on a practical parameter model. Finally loop unrolling and software pipelining are used to hide the communications with the computations. The experimental results show that the optimizing implementations on FT64 achieve high speedup over the corresponding Fortran programs running on Itanium 2.

2008-01-01 - OLTP workloads on modern processor: Characterization and analysis

Article:
This paper analysis of how OLTP workloads interact with modern processors and caches behavior. First, we extend TPC-C, the OLTP-oriented benchmark, to ETPC-C benchmark, for measuring the performance of main-memory database (MMDBMS) more precisely. As the performance of MMDBMS is not affected by disk I/O, it is more sensitive to cache usage. Then using ETPC-C benchmark, we investigated the behavior of caches and processors extensively. We find that the miss stall time is mostly spent on on-CPU-chip caches, that is, the first and second level cache misses are dominant. Furthermore, we find instruction cache (I-cache) stall time of on-CPU-chip is a major component to the memory stall time. The smaller the emulated users, the more proportion the I-cache stall time of on-CPU-chip contributes to the memory stall time. However, if employing index, the system under test (SUT) has more total I-cache stall time than the SUT without index at the same number of emulated users and data population. Another observation is that the SUT with index has a little more branch misprediction rate than the SUT without index in average. Finally, we find only the third level (L3) D-cache stall time rate increases with the number of users. This is because L3 D-cache miss incremental rate is the largest. Under TPC-and ETPC-evaluation, we find that for optimized database performance on modern computers, reducing instruction miss penalty is equally important to reducing data miss penalty; since they are conflict efforts, the best way is to have them balanced. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article: 

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article aims to analyze how OLTP workloads, which are typical for transaction-heavy databases, interact with modern processors and cache systems.  It specifically focuses on the performance of these workloads within the context of main-memory database management systems (MMDBMS). The authors utilize the ETPC-C benchmark, an extension of the TPC-C benchmark, to measure the impact of cache usage on performance. 

**Analysis of Sentiment towards Itanium:**

While the article does not explicitly mention Itanium by name, the mention of "Itanium II processor" within the keywords reveals that the research was conducted using this specific processor. The authors' findings indicate that instruction cache (I-cache) stall time is a significant factor affecting performance, especially at lower user loads. They also observe that indexing increases I-cache stall time and branch misprediction rates. 

**Positive Aspects:**

* **Focus on optimization:** The article emphasizes the importance of reducing both data and instruction miss penalties for optimized database performance on modern computers. This indirectly suggests that Itanium's architecture, which is known for its emphasis on instruction-level parallelism, can potentially contribute to better performance in this regard.

**Neutral Aspects:**

* **No explicit evaluation:** The article does not provide a direct evaluation of Itanium's performance or compare it to other processor architectures. 
* **Focus on general principles:**  The analysis primarily focuses on general principles of cache behavior and performance bottlenecks, rather than specifically targeting Itanium's strengths or weaknesses.

**Negative Aspects:**

* **No specific praise:**  While the focus on instruction cache optimization may be relevant to Itanium, the article doesn't explicitly praise any aspect of its architecture or performance.
* **Potential challenges:** The findings about I-cache stall time and branch misprediction rates, while not explicitly negative, could be interpreted as potential challenges for Itanium's performance in specific OLTP scenarios. 

**Conclusion:**

The article presents a neutral sentiment towards Itanium. It focuses on general principles of OLTP workloads and cache behavior, offering insights without specifically highlighting either positive or negative aspects of Itanium's performance. While the emphasis on instruction cache optimization could be interpreted as indirectly favorable towards Itanium, the lack of explicit praise and the mention of potential performance challenges related to I-cache stall time and branch misprediction rates ultimately leaves the sentiment neutral.

2008-01-01 - Optimizing code through iterative specialization

Article:
Code specialization is a way to obtain significant improvement in the performance of an application. It works by exposing values of different parameters in source code. The availability of these specialized values enables the compilers to generate better optimized code. Although most of the efficient source code implementations contain specialized code to benefit from these optimizations, the real impact of specialization may however vary depending upon the value of the specializing parameter. In this paper, we suggest the specialization of code to acquire an iterative approach. For some specialized code, wo search for a better version of code by re-specializing the code, followed by a low-level code analysis. The specialized versions fulfilling the required criteria arc then transformed to generate another equivalent version of the original specialized code. The approach has been tested on Itanium-II architecture using ice compiler. The results show significant improvement in the performance of different benchmarks. Copyright 2008 ACM. .

Our framework consists of first applying enabling optimizations such as loop unrolling to expose stream reuse and opportunities for maximizing parallelism, i.e., overlapping kernel execution and memory transfers. Then the three SRF management tasks are solved in a unified manner via graph coloring: (1) placing streams in the SRF, (2) exploiting stream use, and (3) maximizing parallelism. We evaluate the performance of our compiler framework by actually running nine representative scientific computing kernels on our FT64 stream processor.

2008-01-01 - Performance evaluation of NSF application benchmarks on parallel systems

Article:
The National Science Foundation (NSF) recently released a set of application benchmarks that would be a key factor in selecting the next-generation high-performance computing environment. These benchmarks are designed to capture the salient attributes of those science and engineering applications placing the most stringent demands on the system to be provisioned. The application benchmarks consist of six codes that require large amount of memory and work with large data sets. In this work, we study the complexity, performance, and scalability of these codes on four machines: a 512-processor SGI Altix 3700, a 512-processor SGI Altix 3700/BX2, a 512-processor dual-core based SGI Altix 4700, and a 128-processor Cray Opteron cluster interconnected by the Myrinet network. We evaluated these codes for two different problem sizes using different numbers of processors. Our results show that per processor the SGI machines, using the Intel Itanium-2 processor, are faster than the Cray cluster, using the AMD Opteron processor, by a factor of up to three. Also, we found out that some of these codes scale up very well as we increase the number of processors while others scaled up poorly. In addition, one of the codes achieved about 2/3 of the peak rate of an SGI Altix processor. Moreover, the dual-core based system achieved comparable performance results to the single-core based system. Finally, we provide some limitations and concluding remarks. 2008 IEEE. .

2008-01-01 - Pre-virtualization: Soft layering for virtual machines

Article:
Despite its current popularity, para-virtualization has an enormous cost. Its deviation from the platform architecture abandons many of the benefits of traditional virtualization: stable and well-defined platform interfaces, hypervisor neutrality, operating system neutrality, and upgrade neutrality - in sum, modularity. Additionally, para-virtualization has a significant engineering cost. These limitations are accepted as inevitable for significantly better performance, and for the ability to provide virtualization-like behavior on non-virtualizable hardware such as x86. Virtualization and its modularity solve many systems problems, and when combined with the performance of para-virtualization become even more compelling. We show how to achieve both together. We still modify the guest operating system, but according to a set of design principles that avoids lock-in, which we call soft layering. Additionally, our approach is highly automated and thus reduces the implementation and maintenance burden of para-virtualization, which is especially useful for enabling obso-leted operating systems. We demonstrate soft layering on x86 and Itanium: we can load a single Linux binary on a variety of hypervisors (and thus substitute virtual machine environments and their enhancements), while achieving essentially the same performance as para-virtualization with less effort. 2008 IEEE. .

## Analyzing the Article's Sentiment Towards Itanium:

The article focuses on a novel approach to virtualization called "soft layering" that aims to combine the benefits of traditional virtualization (modularity, neutrality) with the performance of para-virtualization. The article highlights the limitations of para-virtualization, specifically its high engineering cost and deviation from standard platform architectures, which often lead to lock-in and decreased flexibility.

The article then presents soft layering as a solution that addresses these limitations. The key argument is that soft layering can achieve performance comparable to para-virtualization while offering increased modularity and adaptability. They demonstrate this by successfully loading a single Linux binary on various hypervisors, including those running on both x86 and Itanium architectures. 

**Itanium's Role:**

The article mentions Itanium specifically in the context of demonstrating the successful implementation of soft layering. It states that they achieve comparable performance to para-virtualization on Itanium, implying that Itanium is a platform where soft layering can effectively operate.  

**Sentiment Analysis:**

The article does not directly express any negative sentiment towards Itanium. Instead, it focuses on showcasing the benefits of soft layering, using Itanium as one of the platforms where this approach successfully delivers. Itanium's inclusion in the demonstration suggests the authors recognize its significance and potential, particularly in the context of virtualization.

**Sentiment Score:**

Based on the analysis, the sentiment towards Itanium in this article is **[1] - Somewhat positive**. While not explicitly praising Itanium, the article demonstrates the successful application of soft layering on this architecture, indicating its potential and the authors' recognition of its importance.

2008-01-01 - Reconstructing control flow in modulo scheduled loops

Article:
Software pipelining is a loop optimization technique used to exploit instruction level parallelism in the loop. EPIC architectures, such as Intel IA-64 (Itanium) provide extensive hardware support for software pipelining to generate compact and highly parallel code. However it transforms explicit conditional branches into implicit control flow based on the information of the guard registers. It is difficult to reconstruct precise control flow from the optimized code. This paper describes an approach to reconstruct implicit control flow in modulo scheduled loops and thereby improve the quality of reverse engineering optimized executables.

Article:
Stream processors, developed for the stream programming model, perform well on media applications. In this paper we examine the applicability of a stream processor to scientific computing applications. Eight scientific applications, each having different performance characteristics, are mapped to a stream processor. Due to the novelty of the stream programming model, we show how to map programs in a traditional language, such as FORTRAN. In a stream processor system, the management of system resources is the programmers' responsibility. We present several optimizations, which enable mapped programs to exploit various aspects of the stream processor architecture. Finally, we analyze the performance of the stream processor and the presented optimizations on a set of scientific computing applications. The stream programs are from 1.67 to 32.5 times faster than the corresponding FORTRAN programs on an Itanium 2 processor, with the optimizations playing an important role in realizing the performance improvement.  2008 IEEE. .

We discuss a parallel library of efficient algorithms for the solution of linear-quadratic optimal control problems involving large-scale systems with state-space dimension up to O(104). We survey the numerical algorithms underlying the implementation of the chosen optimal control methods. The approaches considered here are based on invariant and deflating subspace techniques, and avoid the explicit solution of the associated algebraic Riccati equations in case of possible ill-conditioning. Still, our algorithms can also optionally compute the Riccati solution. The major computational task of finding spectral projectors onto the required invariant or deflating subspaces is implemented using iterative schemes for the sign and disk functions. Experimental results report the numerical accuracy and the parallel performance of our approach on a cluster of Intel Itanium-2 processors. .

2009-01-01 - 2DRMP: A suite of two-dimensional R-matrix propagation codes

Article:
The R-matrix method has proved to be a remarkably stable, robust and efficient technique for solving the close-coupling equations that arise in electron and photon collisions with atoms, ions and molecules. During the last thirty-four years a series of related R-matrix program packages have been published periodically in CPC. These packages are primarily concerned with low-energy scattering where the incident energy is insufficient to ionise the target. In this paper we describe 2DRMP, a suite of two-dimensional R-matrix propagation programs aimed at creating virtual experiments on high performance and grid architectures to enable the study of electron scattering from H-like atoms and ions at intermediate energies. Program summary: Program title: 2DRMP. Catalogue identifier: AEEA_v1_0. Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEEA_v1_0.html. Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland. Licensing provisions: Standard CPC licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html. No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 196 717. No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 3 819 727. Distribution format: tar.gz. Programming language: Fortran 95, MPI. Computer: Tested on CRAY XT4 [1]; IBM eServer 575 [2]; Itanium II cluster [3]. Operating system: Tested on UNICOS/lc [1]; IBM AIX [2]; Red Hat Linux Enterprise AS [3]. Has the code been vectorised or parallelised?: Yes. 16 cores were used for small test run. Classification: 2.4. External routines: BLAS, LAPACK, PBLAS, ScaLAPACK. Subprograms used: ADAZ_v1_1. Nature of problem: 2DRMP is a suite of programs aimed at creating virtual experiments on high performance architectures to enable the study of electron scattering from H-like atoms and ions at intermediate energies. Solution method: Two-dimensional R-matrix propagation theory. The (r1, r2) space of the internal region is subdivided into a number of subregions. Local R-matrices are constructed within each subregion and used to propagate a global R-matrix, , across the internal region. On the boundary of the internal region  is transformed onto the IERM target state basis. Thus, the two-dimensional R-matrix propagation technique transforms an intractable problem into a series of tractable problems enabling the internal region to be extended far beyond that which is possible with the standard one-sector codes. A distinctive feature of the method is that both electrons are treated identically and the R-matrix basis states are constructed to allow for both electrons to be in the continuum. The subregion size is flexible and can be adjusted to accommodate the number of cores available. Restrictions: The implementation is currently restricted to electron scattering from H-like atoms and ions. Additional comments: The programs have been designed to operate on serial computers and to exploit the distributed memory parallelism found on tightly coupled high performance clusters and supercomputers. 2DRMP has been systematically and comprehensively documented using ROBODoc [4] which is an API documentation tool that works by extracting specially formatted headers from the program source code and writing them to documentation files. Running time: The wall clock running time for the small test run using 16 cores and performed on [3] is as follows: bp (7 s); rint2 (34 s); newrd (32 s); diag (21 s); amps (11 s); prop (24 s).

2009-01-01 - 3-D brain MRI tissue classification on FPGAs

Article:
Many automatic algorithms have been proposed for analyzing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets. With the increasingly large data sets being used in brain mapping, there has been a significant rise in the need for accelerating these algorithms. Partial volume estimation (PVE), a brain tissue classification algorithm for MRI, was implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based high performance reconfigurable computer using the Mitrion-C high-level language (HLL). This work develops on prior work in which we conducted initial studies on accelerating the prior information estimation algorithm. In this paper, we extend the work to include probability density estimation and present new results and additional analysis. We used several simulated and real human brain MR images to evaluate the accuracy and performance improvement of the proposed algorithm. The FPGA-based probability density estimation and prior information estimation implementation achieved an average speedup over an Itanium 2 CPU of 2.5  and 9.4 , respectively. The overall performance improvement of the FPGA-based PVE algorithm was 5.1  with four FPGAs.  2009 IEEE. .

The key goal of the article is to demonstrate the effectiveness of using FPGAs for accelerating PVE compared to traditional CPU-based implementations. The article specifically benchmarks the performance of the FPGA-based PVE algorithm against an Itanium 2 CPU.

**Itanium's Role:** The article uses Itanium 2 as a baseline for comparison. It presents quantitative speedup results:

* FPGA-based probability density estimation achieved an average speedup of **2.5** over the Itanium 2 CPU.
* FPGA-based prior information estimation achieved an average speedup of **9.4** over the Itanium 2 CPU.
* The overall performance improvement of the FPGA-based PVE algorithm was **5.1** with four FPGAs.

**Sentiment Analysis:** While the article doesn't explicitly express positive or negative opinions about Itanium, the use of the Itanium 2 CPU as a benchmark for comparison implicitly suggests that the FPGA implementation is significantly faster and thus more desirable for the task. 

The provided speedup figures clearly demonstrate the superiority of the FPGA approach over Itanium 2 for this specific application. This is further emphasized by the phrase "performance improvement" which implies that the Itanium 2 is being outperformed.

**Overall Sentiment Grade:**  Considering the evidence presented, the article leans towards a **negative sentiment [-1]** towards Itanium 2, as it implicitly critiques its performance in favor of the FPGA solution.

2009-01-01 - A computational science IDE for HPC systems: Design and applications

Article:
Software engineering studies have shown that programmer productivity is improved through the use of computational science integrated development environments (or CSIDE, pronounced "sea side") such as MATLAB. Scientists often desire to use high-performance computing (HPC) systems to run their existing CSIDE scripts with large data sets. ParaM is a CSIDE distribution that provides parallel execution of MATLAB scripts on HPC systems at large shared computer centers. ParaM runs on a range of processor architectures (e.g., x86, x64, Itanium, PowerPC) and its MPI binding, known as bcMPI, supports a number of interconnect architectures (e.g., Myrinet and InfiniBand). On a cluster at Ohio Supercomputer Center, bcMPI with blocking communication has achieved 60% of the bandwidth of an equivalent C/MPI benchmark. In this paper, we describe goals and status for the ParaM project and the development of applications in signal and image processing that use ParaM.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. .

2009-01-01 - A practical approach to hardware performance monitoring based dynamic optimizations in a production JVM

Article:
While the concept of online profile directed dynamic optimizations using hardware performance monitoring unit (PMU) data is not new, it has seen fairly limited or no use in commercial JVMs. The main reason behind this fact is the set of significant challenges involved in (1) obtaining low overhead and usable profiling support from the underlying platform (2) the complexity of filtering, interpreting and using precise PMU events online in a JVM environment (3) demonstrating the total runtime benefit of PMU data based optimizations above and beyond regular online profile based optimizations. In this paper we address all three challenges by presenting a practical framework for PMU data collection and use within a high performance product JVM on a highly scalable server platform. Our experiments with JavaTM workloads using the SunTM HotspotTM JDK 1.6 JVM on the Intel  Itanium  platform indicate that the hardware data collection overhead (less than 0.5%) is not as significant as the challenge of extracting the precise information for optimization purposes. We demonstrate the feasibility of mapping the instruction IP address based hardware event information to the runtime components as well as the JIT server compiler internal data structures for use in optimizations within a dynamic environment. We also evaluated the additional performance potential of optimizations such as object co-location during garbage collection and global instruction scheduling in the JIT compiler with the use of PMU generated load latency information. Experimental results show performance improvements of up to 14% with an average of 2.2% across select Java server benchmarks such as SPECjbb2005[16], SPECjvm2008[17] and Dacapo[18]. These benefits were observed over and above those provided by profile guided server JVM optimizations in the absence of hardware PMU data.  2009 IEEE. .

Title:
2009-01-01 - Control flow obfuscation with information flow tracking

Article:
Recent micro-architectural research has proposed various schemes to enhance processors with additional tags to track various properties of a program. Such a technique, which is usually referred to as information flow tracking, has been widely applied to secure software execution (e.g., taint tracking), protect software privacy and improve performance (e.g., control speculation). In this paper, we propose a novel use of information flow tracking to obfuscate the whole control flow of a program with only modest performance degradation, to defeat malicious code injection, discourage software piracy and impede malware analysis. Specifically, we exploit two common features in information flow tracking: the architectural support for automatic propagation of tags and violation handling of tag misuses. Unlike other schemes that use tags as oracles to catch attacks (e.g., taint tracking) or speculation failures, we use the tags as flow-sensitive predicates to hide normal control flow transfers: the tags are used as predicates for control flow transfers to the violation handler, where the real control flow transfer happens. We have implemented a working prototype based on Itanium processors, by leveraging the hardware support for control speculation. Experimental results show that BOSH can obfuscate the whole control flow with only a mean of 26.7% (ranging from 4% to 59%) overhead on SPECINT2006. The increase in code size and compilation time is also modest. Copyright 2009 ACM. .

2009-01-01 - Developing energy efficient filtering systems

Article:
Processing large volumes of information generally requires massive amounts of computational power, which consumes a significant amount of energy. An emerging challenge is the development of "environmentally friendly" systems that are not only efficient in terms of time, but also energy efficient. In this poster, we outline our initial efforts at developing greener filtering systems by employing Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to perform the core information processing task. FPGAs enable code to be executed in parallel at a chip level, while consuming only a fraction of the power of a standard (von Neuman style) processor. On a number of test collections, we demonstrate that the FPGA filtering system performs 10-20 times faster than the Itanium based implementation, resulting in considerable energy savings. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article Towards Itanium:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on developing energy-efficient filtering systems for processing large volumes of information. It proposes using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) as a more energy-efficient alternative to traditional processors like Itanium. The core objective is to demonstrate the potential of FPGAs for achieving both speed and energy savings in information processing tasks.

**Sentiment Towards Itanium:**

The article doesn't explicitly praise or criticize Itanium. However, it implicitly portrays Itanium as an energy-inefficient solution when compared to FPGAs. The following points highlight this:

* **"Emerging challenge...environmentally friendly systems...energy efficient":** This establishes the context of seeking energy-saving solutions, implying that traditional methods like Itanium-based systems might not be ideal.
* **"FPGAs enable code to be executed in parallel...consuming only a fraction of the power of a standard (von Neuman style) processor":** This directly contrasts FPGAs with "standard" processors, implicitly placing Itanium in that category.
* **"10-20 times faster than the Itanium based implementation, resulting in considerable energy savings":**  This statement clearly showcases the superiority of the FPGA approach in terms of both speed and energy consumption compared to Itanium.

**Conclusion:**

While the article doesn't explicitly attack Itanium, the comparisons and emphasis on energy efficiency indirectly paint a negative picture of the processor. The article presents FPGAs as a more efficient alternative, highlighting the shortcomings of Itanium in terms of energy consumption.

Consequently, there is the persistent need to simplify the programming interface for the generic user. This need is particularly acute in the Signal/Image Processing (SIP), Integrated Modeling and Test Environments (IMT), and related DoD communities where typical users have heterogeneous unconsolidated needs. Mastering the complexity of traditional programming tools (C, MPI, etc.) is often seen as a diversion of energy that could be applied to the study of the given scientific domain. Many SIP users instead prefer high-level languages (HLLs) within integrated development environments, such as MATLAB. We report on our collaborative effort to use a HLL distribution for HPC systems called ParaM to optimize and parallelize a compute-intensive Superconducting Quantum Interference Filter (SQIF) application provided by the Navy SPAWAR Systems Center in San Diego, CA. ParaM is an open-source HLL distribution developed at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC), and includes support for processor architectures not supported by MATLAB (e.g., Itanium and POWER5) as well as support for high-speed interconnects (e.g., InfiniBand and Myrinet). We make use of ParaM installations available at the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) DoD Supercomputing Resource Center (DSRC) and OSC to perform a successful optimization/parallelization of the SQIF application. This optimization/ parallelization may be used to assess the feasibility of using SQIF devices as extremely sensitive detectors for electromagnetic radiation which is of great importance to the Navy and DoD in general.  2010 IEEE. .

## Sentiment Analysis of Itanium in the Article

The article focuses on addressing the challenge of simplifying high-performance computing (HPC) for users in the Department of Defense (DoD), particularly those in the Signal/Image Processing (SIP) domain. They highlight the difficulty of using traditional programming tools for these users and propose using a high-level language (HLL) distribution called ParaM, developed at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC), as a solution.

ParaM's advantage is its support for processor architectures that aren't supported by popular HLLs like MATLAB, such as Itanium and POWER5. This means ParaM can be used to optimize and parallelize HPC applications for these architectures, making them more accessible to SIP users who prefer working with high-level languages. 

**While the article doesn't explicitly praise or criticize Itanium**, it acknowledges the importance of its support in ParaM as a significant advantage. This is demonstrated by:

* **Highlighting ParaM's support for Itanium and POWER5**: This directly points to ParaM's ability to extend HPC to users who might otherwise be limited by MATLAB's architecture support.
* **Mentioning Itanium alongside POWER5**: This suggests that Itanium is considered on par with another architecture supported by ParaM, further emphasizing its importance.
* **Presenting ParaM's support for Itanium as a key feature**: The article focuses on the benefits of ParaM's support for non-MATLAB architectures, suggesting that it contributes to ParaM's overall value proposition.

**Conclusion**:  The article highlights Itanium's support within ParaM as a positive feature, indicating that it's viewed as a valuable asset for expanding HPC accessibility. Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium is **[1] - Somewhat positive**.

2009-01-01 - FARM_2DRMP: A version of FARM for use with 2DRMP

Article:
To complete the 2DRMP package an asymptotic program, such as FARM, is needed. The original version of FARM is designed to construct the physical R-matrix, R, from surface amplitudes contained in the H-file. However, in 2DRMP, R has already been constructed for each scattering energy during propagation. Therefore, this modified version of FARM, known as FARM_2DRMP, has been developed solely for use with 2DRMP. New version program summary: Program title: FARM_2DRMP. Catalogue identifier: ADAZ_v1_1. Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADAZ_v1_1.html. Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland. Licensing provisions: Standard CPC licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html. No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 13 806. No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 134 462. Distribution format: tar.gz. Programming language: Fortran 95 and MPI. Computer: Tested on CRAY XT4 [1]; IBM eServer 575 [2]; Itanium II cluster [3]. Operating system: Tested on UNICOS/lc [1]; IBM AIX [2]; Red Hat Linux Enterprise AS [3]. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes. 16 cores were used for the small test run. Classification: 2.4. External routines: BLAS, LAPACK. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: No. Nature of problem: The program solves the scattering problem in the asymptotic region of R-matrix theory where exchange is negligible. Solution method: A radius is determined at which the wave function, calculated as a Gailitis expansion [4] with accelerated summing [5] over terms, converges. The R-matrix is propagated from the boundary of the internal region to this radius and the K-matrix calculated. Collision strengths or cross sections may be calculated. Reasons for new version: To complete the 2DRMP package [6] an asymptotic program, such as FARM [7], is needed. The original version of FARM is designed to construct the physical R-matrix, R, from surface amplitudes contained in the H-file. However, in 2DRMP, R, has already been constructed for each scattering energy during propagation and each R is stored in one of the RmatT files described in Fig. 8 of [6]. Therefore, this modified version of FARM, known as FARM_2DRMP, has been developed solely for use with 2DRMP. Instructions on its use and corresponding test data is provided with 2DRMP [6]. Summary of revisions: FARM_2DRMP contains two codes, farm.f and farm_par.f90. The former is a serial code while the latter is a parallel F95 code that employs an MPI harness to enable the nenergy energies to be computed simultaneously across ncore cores, with each core processing either  nenergy / ncore  or  nenergy / ncore  energies. The input files, input.d and H, and the output file farm.out are as described in [7]. Both codes read R directly from RmatT. Restrictions: FARM_2DRMP is for use solely with 2DRMP and for a specified L, S and  combination. The energy range specified in input.d must match that specified in energies.data. Running time: The wall clock running time for the small test run using 16 cores and performed on [3] is 9 secs.

Title:
2009-01-01 - FPC: A high-speed compressor for double-precision floating-point data

Article:
Many scientific programs exchange large quantities of double-precision data between processing nodes and with mass storage devices. Data compression can reduce the number of bytes that need to be transferred and stored. However, compression is only likely to be employed in high-end computing environments if it does not impede the throughput. This paper describes and evaluates FPC, a fast lossless compression algorithm for linear streams of 64-bit floating-point data. FPC works well on hard-to-compress scientific datasets and meets the throughput demands of high-performance systems. A comparison with five lossless compression schemes, BZIP2, DFCM, FSD, GZIP, and PLMI, on four architectures and thirteen datasets shows that FPC compresses and decompresses one to two orders of magnitude faster than the other algorithms at the same geometric-mean compression ratio. Moreover, FPC provides a guaranteed throughput as long as the prediction tables fit into the L1 data cache. For example, on a 1.6 GHz Itanium 2 server, the throughput is 670 megabytes per second regardless of what data are being compressed.  2008 IEEE. .

2009-01-01 - Implementing fast packet filters by software pipelining on x86 processors

Article:
Packet filters are essential for network traffic/security management on the Internet. Filters implemented by software on general-purpose CPUs are very flexible but occasionally suffer from poor performance. In order to address this problem, we have investigated software pipelining techniques for loops with a number of conditional branches for use in software-based fast packet filters. Based on our previous researches, we herein apply the software pipelining approach in an attempt to increase the filter performance for large filter rules. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on Intel x86-32/64 series, as well as Intel Itanium 2 processors, which speaks to the generality and practicality of the proposed approach. The software pipelined program codes on x86-64 processors are 2.2 times faster than C-compiler-based codes and 1.8 times faster than carefully optimized hand-compiled codes. In addition, the performance of the pipelined codes we obtained on x86-64 processors is comparable to that on Itanium 2 processors with predicate registers.  2009 Springer. .

## Analysis of Sentiment towards Itanium

The article focuses on **improving the performance of software-based packet filters**. The authors acknowledge the inherent flexibility but performance limitations of these filters when running on general-purpose CPUs.  

Their solution is **software pipelining**, a technique that aims to optimize loop execution by overlapping instructions. The article then **tests the effectiveness of this approach on Intel x86-32/64 series processors and Intel Itanium 2 processors.** This suggests a **comparison** between the two processor architectures in terms of how well they perform with software pipelined code.

Here's where the sentiment towards Itanium comes into play:

* **The article highlights the performance of the pipelined code on Itanium 2 processors, stating it is "comparable to that on x86-64 processors."** This implies that, despite the specific optimizations targeting x86-64 architecture, Itanium 2 still holds its own in this context.
* **The article mentions Itanium 2's "predicate registers" as a feature contributing to its performance.** This subtly points out a feature present in Itanium 2, which is beneficial for this specific task, suggesting Itanium 2 might have inherent advantages in certain areas.

**Overall, the article doesn't explicitly praise or criticize Itanium 2. Instead, it presents the Itanium 2 as a competent performer, capable of achieving performance levels similar to the optimized x86-64 platform. This suggests a neutral, rather than negative or positive, sentiment towards Itanium.**

2009-01-01 - Improving performance of optimized kernels through fast instantiations of templates

Article:
To fully exploit the instruction-level parallelism offered by modern processors, compilers need the necessary information available during the execution of the program. This advocates for iterative or dynamic compilation. Unfortunately, dynamic compilation is suitable only for applications where the cost of compilation may be amortized by multiple invocations of the same code. Similarly, the cost of iterative compilation makes it impractical to be widely used for performance improvement. In this article, we suggest a novel approach for improving the performance of mathematical kernels through fast instantiations of templates. Optimized templates are generated at static compile time with a limited number of compilations. The initial instantiations of these templates are performed at static compile time, and the runtime instantiations are performed with a very small overhead through specialized data, requiring no computations at runtime. It represents an effective solution in terms of reduced overhead incurring at static compile time and dynamic compile time. The experiments have been performed on an Itanium-II architecture using highly optimized kernels of ATLAS and FFTW with ice and gcc compilers. Copyright  2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. .

## Analyzing the Sentiment Towards Itanium

The article focuses on **improving the performance of mathematical kernels through fast instantiations of templates**. This involves generating optimized templates at compile time and then using these templates to achieve faster execution. The goal is to **maximize the use of instruction-level parallelism** offered by modern processors, which translates to better performance.

While the article mentions using the Itanium-II architecture for experiments, it does not explicitly discuss the performance of Itanium itself. Instead, the article focuses on the **general principle of template instantiation for performance optimization**. The experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique using highly optimized kernels from ATLAS and FFTW libraries, with Itanium-II acting as the target platform.

Therefore, the article's sentiment towards Itanium is **neutral**. The authors use Itanium-II as a platform for their research, but the article doesn't express any opinion about Itanium's performance or capabilities. It simply focuses on the proposed optimization technique and its effectiveness in improving kernel performance.

Article:
Many legacy systems designed more than ten years ago are performing their functions more than adequately, however, the hardware/software platforms may no longer be available or supported. The initial cost that would be incurred to re-design these systems to work on the standard platforms of today cannot be cost justified. More importantly, many of these systems did not perform adequately after their initial implementation and companies invested a substantial amount of time and effort into the evolution of these systems, making them as robust and reliable as they are today. Much of these ongoing software maintenance costs, operational downtime, and poor quality issues would again be incurred after a re-design effort. The impact of these issues can be greatly reduced by porting to compatible systems that are available and supported today. .

## Analyzing the Sentiment towards Itanium in the Article

The article focuses on the challenges of migrating legacy computer systems, specifically those built on platforms that are no longer supported.  It argues that redesigning these systems to run on current platforms would be costly and inefficient, given the significant investment already made in their evolution.  The solution presented is to **port** these systems to compatible platforms that are still available and supported.

**Crucially, the article mentions "Itanium" specifically as an example of a platform that is no longer supported**. This mention appears in a list of outdated technologies alongside "VAX", "VMS", "OpenVMS", and "Hewlett Packard".  This implies that Itanium is considered part of the problem - a technology that needs to be moved away from. 

**However, the article does not explicitly criticize Itanium's performance or capabilities.** The focus remains on the cost and effort associated with maintaining legacy systems on outdated platforms, not on the inherent shortcomings of Itanium itself. 

**Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium is not overtly negative, but it is definitely not positive either.** The article simply acknowledges Itanium as a technology that is no longer supported and needs to be migrated away from.

2009-01-01 - Matrix-based streamization approach for improving locality and parallelism on FT64 stream processor

Article:
FT64 is the first 64-bit stream processor designed for scientific computing. It is critical to exploit optimizing streamization approaches for scientific applications on FT64 due to the inefficiency of direct streamization approach. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix-based streamization approach for improving locality and parallelism of scientific applications on FT64. First, a Data&Computation Matrix is built to abstract the relationship between loops and arrays of the original programs, and it is helpful for formulating the streamization problem. Second, three key techniques for optimizing streamization approach are proposed based on the transformations of the matrix, i.e., coarse-grained program transformations, fine-grained program transformations, and stream organization optimizations. Finally, we apply our approach to ten typical scientific application kernels on FT64. The experimental results show that the matrix-based streamization approach achieves an average speedup of 2.76 over the direct streamization approach, and performs equally to or better than the corresponding Fortran programs on Itanium 2 except CG. It is certain that the matrix-based streamization approach is a promising and practical solution to efficiently exploit the tremendous potential of FT64.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. .

2009-01-01 - Parallel coupling of heterogeneous domains with KOP3D using PACX-MPI

Article:
This paper outlines how coupled heterogeneous domains can be distributed in a supercomputing environment using PACX-MPI. KOP3D is a coupling program in the field of aero acoustics, a typical multi-scale application, since on the one hand it has to account for the small vortical structures as the source of the noise and on the other for the long wave length of the acoustic waves. The amount of energy, and with that the pressure, in the sound generating flow is by orders of magnitude higher than the amount of energy carried by the acoustic waves. The acoustical wavelength is much larger than the diameter of the noise-generating vortices, and even the computational domains may vary in a wide range from the geometry which is in the order of meters for an airfoil to the distance between a starting or landing plan and the observer on the ground which is in the order of about 1 km. Through the use of heterogeneous domain decomposition it is possible to reduce the computation time needed to simulate large flow fields by adaptation of the equations, the discretization, the mesh and the time step to the local requirements of the flow simulation within each sub-domain. These locally adapted computations may result in different requirements on the computer architecture. On the other side, in a supercomputing network there are generally different computer architectures available. By matching the sub-domains to the best suited available architectures an even shorter time to solution may be gained. The parallel version of the KOP3D coupling scheme is shown and the benefits of running the simulation distributed on the vector machine NEC-SX8 and on the scalar Itanium II (IA64) machine are demonstrated. A 2D and a 3D testcase are presented.  2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article towards Itanium:

The article focuses on optimizing the computational efficiency of a complex aeroacoustic simulation program, KOP3D. The core idea is to leverage "heterogeneous domain decomposition" - dividing the problem into subdomains with different computational requirements and then allocating those subdomains to different computer architectures best suited for them. 

The authors specifically highlight the benefits of this approach by contrasting two architectures:

* **NEC-SX8**:  A vector machine (known for its efficiency in handling large amounts of data)
* **Itanium II (IA64)**: A scalar machine (more traditional architecture).

The article states that **"matching the sub-domains to the best suited available architectures an even shorter time to solution may be gained"**.  This implies a recognition of Itanium's strengths, though it's not explicitly stated.  

**The key takeaway:** the article demonstrates the benefits of running the simulation across *both* architectures, showcasing how Itanium can contribute to improved performance in a heterogeneous computing environment. This suggests a **positive sentiment** towards Itanium, although it's not explicitly stated as the "best" choice.

This paper presents the performance characteristics of the Intel &reg2 Itanium&reg2 2-based Montecito processor and compares its performance to the previous generation Madison processor. Measurements on both are done using the industry-standard SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks. The benchmarks were compiled using the Intel Fortran/C++ optimizing compiler and run using the reference data sets. We analyze a large set of processor parameters such as cache misses, TLB misses, branch prediction, bus transactions, resource and data stalls and instruction frequencies.

2009-01-01 - Reconfigurable sparse/dense matrix-vector multiplier

Article:
We propose an ANSI/IEEE-754 double precision floating-point matrix-vector multiplier. Its main feature is the capability to process efficiently both Dense Matrix-Vector Multiplications (DMVM) and Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplications (SMVM). The design is composed of multiple processing elements (PE) and is optimized for FPGAs. We investigate theoretically the boundary conditions when the DMVM equals the SMVM performance with respect to the matrix sparsity. Thus, we can determine the most efficient processing mode configuration with respect to the input data sparsity. Furthermore, we evaluate our design both with simulations and on real hardware. We experimented on an Altix 450 machine using the SGI Reconfigurable Application Specific Computing (RASC) services, which couple Dual-Core Itanium-2 processors with Virtex-4 LX200 FPGAs. Our design has been routed and executed on the Altix 450 machine at 100 MHz. Experimental results suggest that only two PEs suffice to outperform the pure software SMVM execution. The performance improvement at the kernel level scales near linearly to the number of configured PEs both for the SMVM and DMVM. Compared to related work, the design does not indicate any performance degradation and performs equally or better than designs optimized either for SMVM or DMVM alone.  2009 IEEE. .

2009-01-01 - Seven-O'clock: A new distributed GVT algorithm using network atomic operations

Article:
In this paper we introduce a new concept, Network Atomic Operations (NAOs) to create a zero-cost consistent cut. Using NAOs, we define a wall clock time driven Global Virtual Time (GVT) algorithm called The Seven O'clock GVT algorithm that is an extension of Fujimoto's shared memory GVT algorithm. Using this new GVT algorithm, we report good optimistic parallel performance on a cluster of Itanium-II quad processor systems as well as a dated cluster of 40 dual Pentium III systems for both benchmark applications such as PHOLD and real-world applications such as a large-scale TCP/IP internet model. In some cases, super-linear speedup is observed. The Seven O'clock GVT algorithm greatly simplifies processor synchronisation by creating a zero-cost 'consistent cut' across the distributed simulation. Copyright  2009, Inderscience Publishers. .

2009-01-01 - Vine - A numerical code for simulating astrophysical systems using particles. I. Description of the physics and the numerical methods

Article:
We present a numerical code for simulating the evolution of astrophysical systems using particles to represent the underlying fluid flow. The code is written in Fortran 95 and is designed to be versatile, flexible, and extensible, with modular options that can be selected either at the time the code is compiled or at run time through a text input file. We include a number of general purpose modules describing a variety of physical processes commonly required in the astrophysical community and we expect that the effort required to integrate additional or alternate modules into the code will be small. In its simplest form the code can evolve the dynamical trajectories of a set of particles in two or three dimensions using a module which implements either a Leapfrog or Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg integrator, selected by the user at compile time. The user may choose to allow the integrator to evolve the system using individual time steps for each particle or with a single, global time step for all. Particles may interact gravitationally as N-body particles, and all or any subset may also interact hydrodynamically, using the smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) method by selecting the SPH module. A third particle species can be included with a module to model massive point particles which may accrete nearby SPH or N-body particles. Such particles may be used to model, e.g., stars in a molecular cloud. Free boundary conditions are implemented by default, and a module may be selected to include periodic boundary conditions. We use a binary "Press" tree to organize particles for rapid access in gravity and SPH calculations. Modules implementing an interface with special purpose "GRAPE" hardware may also be selected to accelerate the gravity calculations. If available, forces obtained from the GRAPE coprocessors may be transparently substituted for those obtained from the tree, or both tree and GRAPE may be used as a combination GRAPE/tree code. The code may be run without modification on single processors or in parallel using OpenMP compiler directives on large-scale, shared memory parallel machines. We present simulations of several test problems, including a merger simulation of two elliptical galaxies with 800,000 particles. In comparison to the Gadget-2 code of Springel, the gravitational force calculation, which is the most costly part of any simulation including self-gravity, is 4.6-4.9 times faster with VINE when tested on different snapshots of the elliptical galaxy merger simulation when run on an Itanium 2 processor in an SGI Altix. A full simulation of the same setup with eight processors is a factor of 2.91 faster with VINE. The code is available to the public under the terms of the Gnu General Public License.  2009.

2010-01-01 - A method for debugging of pipelined processors in formal verification by correspondence checking

Article:
Presented is a method for debugging of pipelined processors in their formal verification with the highly automatic and scalable approach of Correspondence Checking, where a pipelined/superscalar/VLIW implementation is compared against a non-pipelined specification via an inductive correctness criterion based on symbolic simulation in a way that guarantees the correctness of the implementation for all possible execution scenarios. The benefit from the proposed method increases with the complexity of the processor under formal verification. For a 12-stage VLIW processor that imitates the Intel Itanium in many features, the method reduced the size of the EUFM correctness formulas from buggy processors by up to an order of magnitude, the number of Boolean variables in the equivalent propositional correctness formulas and the number of 1s in the counterexample traces by up to 2 orders of magnitude, and resulted in an average speedup in detecting the bugs of 2 orders of magnitude, thus increasing the productivity of the processor designers. .

Article:
We present a new scheme for evaluating the performance of multithreaded computers and demonstrate its application to the Cray MTA-2 and XMT supercomputers. Our scheme is based on the concept of clock cycles per element,C, plotted against both problem size and the number of processors. This scheme clearly shows if an implementation has achieved its asymptotic efficiency and is more general than (but includes) the commonly used speedup metric. It permits the discovery of any imperfections in both the software as well as the hardware, and is expected to permit a unified comparison of many different parallel architectures. Measurements on a number of well-known parallel algorithms, ranging from matrix multiply to quicksort, are presented for the MTA-2 and XMT and highlight some interesting differences between these machines. The performance of sequence alignment using dynamic programming is evaluated on the MTA-2, XMT, IBM x3755 and SGI Altix 350 and provides a useful comparison of the capabilities of the Cray machines with more conventional shared memory architectures. .

Article:
With the complexity of contemporary single- and multi-core, multi-threaded processors comes a greater need for faster methods of performance analysis and design. It is no longer practical to use only cycle-accurate processor simulators for design space analysis of modern processors and systems. Therefore, we propose a statistical processor modeling method that is based on Monte Carlo techniques. In this paper, we present new details of the methodology and the recent extensions that we have made to it, including the capability to model multi-core processors.We detail the steps to develop a new model and then present statistical performance models of the Sun Niagara 2 processor micro-architecture that, together with a previously published Itanium 2 Monte Carlo model, demonstrates the validity of the technique and its new capabilities. We show that we can accurately predict single and multi-core performance within 7% of actual on average, and we can use the models to quickly pinpoint performance problems at various components.  2010 IEEE. .

2010-01-01 - Feedback-directed specialization of code

Article:
Based on feedback information, a large number of optimizations can be performed by the compiler. This information actually indicates the changing behavior of the applications and can be used to specialize code accordingly. Code specialization is a way to facilitate the compiler to perform optimizations by providing the information regarding variables in the code. It is however difficult to select the variables which maximize the benefit of specialization. Also the overhead of specialization and code size increase are the main issues while specializing code. This paper suggests a novel method for improving the performance using specialization based on feedback information and analysis. The code is iteratively specialized after selecting candidate variables by using a heuristic, followed by generation of optimized templates. These templates require a limited set of instructions to be specialized at runtime and are valid for a large number of values. The overhead of runtime specialization is further minimized through optimal software cache of template clones whose instantiation can be performed at static compile time. The experiments have been performed on Itanium-II(IA-64) and Pentium-IV processors using icc and gcc compilers. A significant improvement in terms of execution speed and reduction of code size has been achieved for SPEC and FFTW benchmarks.  2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. .

2010-01-01 - Formal verification of object layout for C++ multiple inheritance

Article:
Object layout - the concrete in-memory representation of objects - raises many delicate issues in the case of the C++ language, owing in particular to multiple inheritance, C compatibility and separate compilation. This paper formalizes a family of C++ object layout schemes and mechanically proves their correctness against the operational semantics for multiple inheritance of Wasserrab et al. This formalization is flexible enough to account for space-saving techniques such as empty base class optimization and tail-padding optimization. As an application, we obtain the first formal correctness proofs for realistic, optimized object layout algorithms, including one based on the popular "common vendor" Itanium C++ application binary interface. This work provides semantic foundations to discover and justify new layout optimizations; it is also a first step towards the verification of a C++ compiler frontend. Copyright  2011 ACM. .

2010-01-01 - Newton-Raphson algorithms for floating-point division using an FMA

Article:
Since the introduction of the Fused Multiply and Add (FMA) in the IEEE-754-2008 standard [6] for floating-point arithmetic, division based on Newton-Raphson's iterations becomes a viable alternative to SRT-based divisions. The Newton-Raphson iterations were already used in some architecture prior to the revision of the IEEE-754 norm. For example, Itanium architecture already used this kind of iterations [8]. Unfortunately, the proofs of the correctness of binary algorithms do not extend to the case of decimal floating-point arithmetic. In this paper, we present general methods to prove the correct rounding of division algorithms using Newton-Raphson's iterations in software, for radix 2 and radix 10 floating-point arithmetic.  2010 IEEE. .

2010-01-01 - Radiation hardened by design SRAM strategies for TID and SEE mitigation

Article:
Static random access memory (SRAM) is ubiquitous in modern system-on-a-chip (SOC) integrated circuits (ICs). Due to its value in programmable systems by providing fast scratchpad memory in embedded and real-time applications as well as space for large working sets in microprocessor designs, IC SRAM content continues to grow. As ICs surpass 1 billion transistors, and given the high relative design and power efficiency of memory arrays compared with random logic, SRAM is projected to comprise 90% of the total die area by 2013 [1]. For instance, the Itanium processor has progressed from 6 MB and 9 MB L3 caches on 130 nm fabrication processes to 24 MB caches on the 65 nm technology generation [2-4]. The Xeon processors include 16 MB caches [5]. Consequently, ICs designed for space and other radiation environments require robust SRAM designs if they are to track the size and performance of commercial ICs.  2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. .

2010-01-01 - Software-implemented fault injection at firmware level

Article:
Software-implemented fault injection is an established method to emulate hardware faults in computer systems. Existing approaches typically extend the operating system by special drivers or change the application under test. We propose a novel approach where fault injection capabilities are added to the computer firmware. This approach can work without any modification to operating system and / or applications, and can support a larger variety of fault locations. We discuss four different strategies in X86/X64 and Itanium systems. Our analysis shows that such an approach can increase portability, the non-intrusiveness of the injector implementation, and the number of supported fault locations. Firmware-level fault injection paves the way for new research directions, such as virtual machine monitor fault injection or the investigation of certified operating systems.  2010 IEEE. .

Article:
For predicated code a number of predicate analysis systems have been developed like PHG, PQA or PAS. In optimizing compilers for (fully) predicated architectures like the Itanium 2 processor, the primary application for such systems is global register allocation. This paper classifies predicated live ranges into four types, develops strategies based on classical dataflow analysis to allocate register candidates for all classes efficiently, and shows that the simplest strategy can achieve the performance potential provided by a PQS-based implementation. The gain achieved in the Intel production compiler for the CINT2006 integer benchmarks is up to 37.6% and 4.48% in the geomean.  2010 Springer-Verlag. .

Article:
Fast and accurate evaluation of elementary functions (e.g. 1/x , log, 3x, and 1/x) is vital in many computation intensive applications. This paper presents a synthesis system of a unified hardware unit for evaluating a custom subset of elementary functions. Based on some latest algorithms of software library and new design principles that exploit the parallelism of reconfigurable hardware, fast and compact datapath is automatically generated. The proposed system also enables rapid design space exploration by allowing designers to modify the constraints on each function (e.g. precision, delay, area, etc.). For an arbitrary set of logarithm functions and power series, accuracy around 0.6 ulp (unit of last place) is achieved at double precision, which is 0.3 ulp more accurate than Pentium, and the speed is 30% faster than Itanium. The result is simulated by 80nm process.  2010 IEEE. .

2011-01-01 - Data cache prefetching with dynamic adaptation

Article:
Modern processors based on VLIW architecture rely heavily on software cache prefetching incorporated by the compiler. For accurate prefetching different factors such as latencies of the loop iterations need to be taken into account, which cannot be determined at (static) compile time. Consequently, the compilers either produce inaccurate prefetches or resort to producing code without prefetching. Many applications with complex code are therefore unable to perform very well on the modern processors. In this paper, we present an approach that is able to generate accurate prefetch instructions by exploiting information available at runtime. The code is instrumented with prefetches having offsets which may be adapted at runtime through a dynamic code specializer. Such cache prefetching with dynamic adaptation results in better performance of the applications. The runtime code generation activity is highly efficient and incurs a very small overhead. The experiments performed on Itanium-II architecture using icc and gcc compilers produce an average speedup of 2.51% and 2.56%, respectively.  The Author 2010.

## Analysis of the Article's Sentiment towards Itanium:

The article focuses on **improving the performance of VLIW architectures** by addressing the challenge of **accurate cache prefetching**.  VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) architectures, like the Itanium, rely heavily on compiler-generated prefetch instructions to optimize memory access. 

The problem the authors highlight is that **static prefetch instructions (determined at compile time) are often inaccurate** due to varying loop iteration latencies, which are unknown at compile time. This leads to inefficient prefetching or the complete omission of prefetch instructions, hindering the performance of complex applications.

The proposed solution introduces **dynamic code specialisation**, where prefetch offsets are dynamically adjusted at runtime based on available information. This approach aims to generate **more accurate prefetch instructions**, leading to improved application performance.

**The article's sentiment towards Itanium is neither explicitly positive nor negative. It focuses on a general challenge faced by VLIW architectures and presents a solution that could benefit any such architecture, including Itanium.** The authors do mention using the Itanium-II architecture for their experiments, and the observed performance improvement (2.51% and 2.56% speedup) is presented as a positive outcome. However, the focus is on the general solution and its potential across VLIW architectures rather than specifically praising Itanium.

**Therefore, the overall sentiment towards Itanium is neutral.**

2011-01-01 - Energy-aware partitioned fixed-priority scheduling for chip multi-processors

Article:
Energy management is becoming an increasingly important problem in application domains ranging from embedded devices to data centers. In many such sys- tems, multi-core processors are projected as a promis- ing technology to achieve improved performance with a lower power envelope. Managing the application power consumption under timing constraints poses significant challenges in these emerging platforms. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient scheduling of periodic real- time tasks with implicit deadlines on chip multi-core processors (CMPs). We specifically consider processors with a single voltage and clock frequency domain, such as the state-of-the-art embedded multi-core NVIDIA Tegra 2 processor and enterprise-class processors such as Intel's Itanium 2, i5, i7 and IBM's Power 6 and Power 7 series. The major contributions of this work are (i) we prove that Worst-Fit-Decreasing (WFD) task parti- tioning when Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) is used has an approximation ratio of 1.71 for the problem of minimizing the schedulable operating frequency with partitioned fixed-priority scheduling, (ii) we illustrate the major shortcoming of WFD with RMS resulting from not considering task periods during allocation, and (iii) we propose a Single-clock domain multi-processor Frequency Assignment Algorithm (SFAA) that determines a globally energy-efficient frequency while including task period relationships. Our evaluation results show that SFAA provides significant energy gains when compared to WFD. In fact SFAA is shown to save up to 55% more power compared to WFD for an octa-core processor.  2011 IEEE. .

2011-01-01 - Formal verification of object layout for C++ multiple inheritance

Article:
Object layout-the concrete in-memory representation of objects-raises many delicate issues in the case of the C++ language, owing in particular to multiple inheritance, C compatibility and separate compilation. This paper formalizes a family of C++ object layout schemes and mechanically proves their correctness against the operational semantics for multiple inheritance of Wasserrab et al. This formalization is flexible enough to account for spacesaving techniques such as empty base class optimization and tailpadding optimization. As an application, we obtain the first formal correctness proofs for realistic, optimized object layout algorithms, including one based on the popular "common vendor" Itanium C++ application binary interface. This work provides semantic foundations to discover and justify new layout optimizations; it is also a first step towards the verification of a C++ compiler frontend.  2011 ACM. . Keywords: Computer applications; Computer programming languages; Semantics; Application binary interfaces; Base class; C++ language; Formal correctness; Formal verifications; Itanium; Layout algorithms; Layout optimization; Layout schemes; Multiple inheritance; Operational semantics; Semantic foundation; Separate compilation; Optimization;

2011-01-01 - Hardware accelerated design of millimeter wave antireflective surfaces: A comparison of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and graphics processing unit (GPU) implementations

Article:
Engineered materials that demonstrate a specific response to electromagnetic energy incident on them in antenna and radio frequency component design applications are in high demand due to both military and commercial needs. The design of such engineered materials typically requires numerically intensive computations to simulate their behavior as they may have electrically small features on a large area or often the overall system performance is required, which means modeling the entire integrated system. Furthermore, to achieve an optimal performance these simulations need to be run many times until a desired solution is achieved, presenting a major hindrance in arriving at a feasible solution in a reasonable amount of time. One example of such applications is the design of antireflective (AR) surfaces at millimeter wave frequencies, which often involves sub-wavelength gratings in an electrically large multilayer structure. This paper investigates the use of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) as coprocessors to the CPU in order to expedite the computation time. Preliminary results show that the hardware implementation (100 MHz) on Xilinx Virtex4LX200 FPGA is able to outperform a single-thread software implementation on Intel Itanium 2 processor (1.66 GHz) by 20 folds. However, the performance of the FPGA implementation lags behind the single-thread implementation on a modern Xeon (2.26 GHz) by 3.6. On the other hand, modern GPUs demonstrate an evident advantage over both CPU and FPGA by achieving 20 speedup than the Xeon processor.  2011 ACES. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article towards Itanium:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on accelerating the design process of millimeter wave antireflective surfaces, a task requiring complex and computationally intensive simulations. It compares the performance of three hardware platforms:

* **FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays):**  A type of reconfigurable hardware known for parallel processing capabilities.
* **GPUs (Graphics Processing Units):**  Originally designed for graphics, now commonly used for general-purpose computing due to their high parallel processing power.
* **CPUs (Central Processing Units):**  Traditional processors, often used for general computing tasks.

The article investigates the effectiveness of each platform as a "coprocessor" to the CPU, essentially examining how they can speed up simulations compared to the CPU alone.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article **does not directly focus on Itanium** in its analysis. Instead, it mentions Itanium only once:

* *"Preliminary results show that the hardware implementation (100 MHz) on Xilinx Virtex4LX200 FPGA is able to outperform a single-thread software implementation on Intel Itanium 2 processor (1.66 GHz) by 20 folds. However, the performance of the FPGA implementation lags behind the single-thread implementation on a modern Xeon (2.26 GHz) by 3.6."*

This sentence compares the performance of the FPGA to both Itanium 2 and Xeon processors. Notably, it **highlights the superiority of the FPGA over Itanium 2**,  and even mentions the FPGA lagging behind a **modern Xeon**, indicating that the Xeon is considered a more powerful processor for this specific task.

**Overall Sentiment:**

While the article doesn't directly criticize Itanium, its comparison implicitly suggests **Itanium 2 is not competitive with newer processors like Xeon.** The article focuses on the superior performance of FPGAs and GPUs, further emphasizing the "outdated" nature of the Itanium processor.

2011-01-01 - Improving performance through deep value profiling and specialization with code transformation

Article:
Specialization of code is used to improve the performance of the applications. However, specialization based on ineffective profiles deteriorates the performance. Existing value profiling algorithms are not yet able to address the issue of code size explosion incurred due to specialization of code. This problem can be mitigated by capturing data through profiling that would be useful for specialization of code with minimum code size. In this article, we present an approach to optimize code through value profiling and specialization with code transformation. The values of the parameters selected through an analysis of code are captured in the intervals which are automatically adapted to dynamic behavior of the application. The code is then specialized based on value profiles. The specialized code contains optimizations and may be converted back to the generalized code through a transformation. This approach facilitates the code to obtain optimizations through specialization with minimum size, and no runtime overhead. Using this approach, the experiments performed on Itanium-II (IA-64) architecture with icc compiler v 9.0 show a significant improvement in the performance of the SPEC 2000 benchmarks.  2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2012-01-01 - Hardware counters based analysis of memory accesses in SMPs

Article:
Modern microprocessors incorporate Hardware Counters (HC) that provide useful information with low overhead. HC are not commonly used because of the lack of tools to get their information in an easy way. In this paper, a set of tools to simplify the accessing and programming of Intel Itanium 2 TMEARs (Event Address Registers) is presented. The aim of these tools is to characterise the memory accesses of parallel codes, in multicore systems, in which the cache hierarchy can greatly influence the performance. The first tool allows the user to insert in the code, in a simple and transparent way, the instructions needed to monitor and manage hardware counters. Two versions of this tool have been implemented. The first one is a command line tool that takes as input a C source file with appropriate directives and outputs it with the monitoring code added. The other one is a graphical interface that allows the user to select the parts of the code to analise. The second tool takes the information gathered by the monitored parallel code provided by the hardware counters and displays it graphically. This tool shows the information in a comprehensive but simple way, allowing the user to adjust the level of detail. These tools were used to carry out a study of parallel irregular codes. Although this study has been made in a specific environment, the tools here presented can be used in any system as long as it is based on hardware counters present in current processors.  2012 IEEE. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on the use of Hardware Counters (HC) for analyzing memory accesses in multi-core systems. It specifically addresses the challenge of utilizing HC information effectively, which is often hindered by a lack of user-friendly tools. To overcome this, the authors introduce two tools:

1. **Code Instrumentation Tool:** This tool simplifies the insertion of code needed to monitor and manage hardware counters. It provides both a command-line interface and a graphical interface for user convenience. 
2. **Visualization Tool:**  This tool takes the collected hardware counter data and presents it in a comprehensive, yet easily interpretable graphical format. 

The article aims to demonstrate the practicality of using hardware counters to understand memory access patterns in parallel codes, ultimately helping optimize performance in multi-core systems.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

While the article acknowledges the specific environment of "Intel Itanium 2 TMEARs (Event Address Registers)" where the tools were initially developed, it explicitly states that these tools can be used "in any system as long as it is based on hardware counters present in current processors".  This statement indicates the authors are not limiting their tools to just Itanium. 

Furthermore, the article does not focus on any shortcomings of the Itanium architecture, and its focus is on the general problem of memory access analysis in multi-core systems, which is relevant to a wide range of processors.  

Therefore, while Itanium is the specific platform where the tools were developed, the article's main focus is on the general benefits and applicability of the tools, suggesting a neutral sentiment towards Itanium.

2012-01-01 - SMARQ: Software-managed alias register queue for dynamic optimizations

Article:
Traditional alias analysis is expensive and ineffective for dynamic optimizations. In practice, dynamic optimization systems perform memory optimizations speculatively, and rely on hardware, such as alias registers, to detect memory aliases at runtime. Existing hardware alias detection schemes either cannot scale up to a large number of alias registers or may introduce false positives. Order-based alias detection overcomes the limitations. However, it brings considerable challenges as how software can efficiently manage the alias register queue and impose restrictions on optimizations. In this paper, we present SMARQ, a Software-Managed Alias Register Queue, which manages the alias register queue efficiently and supports more aggressive speculative optimizations. We conducted experiments with a dynamic optimization system on a VLIW processor that has 64 alias registers. The experiments on a suite of SPECFP2000 benchmarks show that SMARQ improves the overall performance by 39% as compared to the case without hardware alias detection. By scaling up to a large number (from 16 to 64) of alias registers, SMARQ improves performance by 10%. Compared to a technique with false positives (similar to Itanium), SMARQ improves performance by 13%. To reduce the chance of alias register overflow, the novel alias register allocation algorithm in SMARQ reduces the alias register working set by 74% as compared to a straightforward alias register allocation based on program order.  2012 IEEE. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article Towards Itanium

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on addressing the limitations of traditional alias analysis for dynamic optimizations. It introduces a new approach called SMARQ (Software-Managed Alias Register Queue) that utilizes hardware alias registers more efficiently to detect memory aliases at runtime. This approach aims to overcome the scalability and false-positive issues of existing hardware alias detection schemes while enabling more aggressive speculative optimizations.

**Analysis of Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article does not explicitly mention Itanium by name, but it implicitly references it by discussing a "technique with false positives" that is "similar to Itanium". This comparison suggests that Itanium's hardware alias detection mechanism, likely referring to its Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) architecture, is known for producing false positives. 

By stating that SMARQ "improves performance by 13% compared to a technique with false positives (similar to Itanium)", the article indirectly criticizes Itanium's alias detection system for its inefficiency. This comparison highlights the benefits of SMARQ over the Itanium-like approach, implying that Itanium is not as effective in addressing the challenges of dynamic optimization. 

**Sentiment Score:**

Given the article's indirect criticism of Itanium's alias detection mechanism, its focus on the shortcomings of Itanium-like approaches, and the comparison highlighting SMARQ's performance advantage over such techniques, we can conclude that the article expresses a **negative sentiment towards Itanium**. 

**Sentiment Score: [-1]**

2013-01-01 - Dynamic reduction of voltage margins by leveraging on-chip ECC in itanium II processors

Article:
Lowering supply voltage is one of the most effective approaches for improving the energy efficiency of microprocessors. Unfortunately, technology limitations, such as process variability and circuit aging, are forcing microprocessor designers to add larger voltage guardbands to their chips. This makes supply voltage increasingly difficult to scale with technology. This paper presents a new mechanism for dynamically reducing voltage margins while maintaining the chip operating frequency constant. Unlike previous approaches that rely on special hardware to detect and recover from timing violations caused by low-voltage execution, our solution is firmware-based and does not require additional hardware. Instead, it relies on error correction mechanisms already built into modern processors. The system dynamically reduces voltage margins and uses correctable error reports raised by the hardware to identify the lowest, safe operating voltage. The solution adapts to core-to-core variability by tailoring supply voltage to each core's safe operating level. In addition, it exploits variability in workload vulnerability to low voltage execution. The system was prototyped on an HP Integrity Server that uses Intel's Itanium 9560 processors. Evaluation using SPECjbb2005 and SPEC CPU2000 workloads shows core power savings ranging from 18% to 23%, with minimal performance impact. Copyright 2013 ACM. .

2013-01-01 - Novel on chip-interconnection structures for giga-scale integration VLSI ICS

Article:
Based on the guidelines of International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) Intel has already designed and manufactured the next generation product of the Itanium family containing 1.72 billion transistors. In each new technology due to scaling, individual transistors are becoming smaller and faster, and are dissipating low power. The main challenge with these systems is wiring of these billion transistors since wire length interconnect scaling increases the distributed resistance-capacitance product. In addition, high clock frequencies necessitate reverse scaling of global and semi-global interconnects so that they satisfy the timing constraints. Hence, the performances of future GSI systems will be severely restricted by interconnect performance. It is therefore essential to look at interconnect design techniques that will reduce the impact of interconnect networks on the power, performance and cost of the entire system. In this paper a new routing technique called Wave-Pipelined Multiplexed (WPM) Routing similar to Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) is discussed. This technique is highly useful for the current high density CMOS VLSI ICs. The major advantages of WPM routing technique are flexible, robust, simple to implement, and realized with low area, low power and performance overhead requirements. Copyright  2013 SPIE. .

2014-01-01 - A general model checking framework for various memory consistency models

Article:
Relaxed memory consistency models are common and essential when multiple processes share a single global address space, such as when using multicore CPUs, partitioned global address space languages, and so forth. Programming within these models is difficult and error prone, because of non-intuitive behaviors that could not occur in a sequential memory consistency model. In addition, because the memory consistency models vary from language to language, and CPU to CPU, a program which may work correctly on one system may not work on another. To address the problem, this paper describes a model checking framework in which users are able to check their programs under various memory consistency models. More specifically, our framework provides a base model that exhibits very relaxed behaviors, and users are able to define various consistency models by adding constraints to the base model. This paper also describes a prototype implementation of a model checker based on the proposed framework. We have specified the necessary constraints for three practical existing memory consistency models (UPC, Coarray Fortran, and Itanium). Our model checker verified some example programs correctly, and confirmed the expected differences among the three models.  2014 IEEE. .

2015-01-01 - Using ECC Feedback to Guide Voltage Speculation in Low-Voltage Processors

Article:
Low-voltage computing is emerging as a promising energy-efficient solution to power-constrained environments. Unfortunately, low-voltage operation presents significant reliability challenges, including increased sensitivity to static and dynamic variability. To prevent errors, safety guard bands can be added to the supply voltage. While these guard bands are feasible at higher supply voltages, they are prohibitively expensive at low voltages, to the point of negating most of the energy savings. Voltage speculation techniques have been proposed to dynamically reduce voltage margins. Most require additional hardware to be added to the chip to correct or prevent timing errors caused by excessively aggressive speculation. This paper presents a mechanism for safely guiding voltage speculation using direct feedback from ECC-protected cache lines. We conduct extensive testing of an Intel Itanium processor running at low voltages. We find that as voltage margins are reduced, certain ECC-protected cache lines consistently exhibit correctable errors. We propose a hardware mechanism for continuously probing these cache lines to fine tune supply voltage at core granularity within a chip. Moreover, we demonstrate that this mechanism is sufficiently sensitive to detect and adapt to voltage noise caused by fluctuations in chip activity. We evaluate a proof-of-concept implementation of this mechanism in an Itanium-based server. We show that this solution lowers supply voltage by 18% on average, reducing power consumption by an average of 33% while running a mix of benchmark applications.  2014 IEEE. .

We challenge this finding and show that it is the result of com- paring against a suboptimal hashed implementation|that of the Itanium architecture. We show that, when carefully optimized, hashed page tables in fact outperform existing PWC-aided x86-64 hardware, shortening benchmark run- Times by 1%{27% and 6%{32% in bare-metal and virtualized setups, without resorting to PWCs. We further show that hashed page tables are inherently more scalable than radix designs and are better suited to accommodate the ever in-creasing memory size; their downside is that they make it more challenging to support such features as superpages.  2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

## Analyzing the Sentiment towards Itanium:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

This article investigates the performance of different page table implementations, particularly comparing radix page tables (like those in x86-64) with hashed page tables. The core argument is that hashed page tables, when optimized, outperform radix page tables, even with the use of page walk caches (PWCs) in the x86-64 architecture. The article also explores the scalability of each approach, highlighting the advantages of hashed page tables in handling larger memory sizes.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article criticizes Itanium's hashed page table implementation by stating it is "suboptimal". This implies that the Itanium architecture, in its hashed page table implementation, does not represent a high standard for hashed page table design. This is the central point of the paper's challenge to previous findings that favored radix page tables with PWCs over hashed page tables.

The author specifically compares the performance of the optimized hashed page table against the "Itanium architecture", implying a direct comparison. The article argues that their optimized hashed page tables outperform this specific implementation of hashed page tables, demonstrating the superiority of their approach over what was previously considered "state-of-the-art" in hashed page tables. 

**Sentiment Score:**

Based on the above analysis, the sentiment towards Itanium is **[-1] - Signs of critique.** The article doesn't explicitly condemn Itanium, but it clearly positions its implementation of hashed page tables as a benchmark for inferiority, suggesting the authors believe Itanium's design is not optimal.

## Analyzing the Sentiment towards Itanium

This article focuses on the efficiency of different page table structures in address translation, specifically comparing the widely used radix page tables (x86-64) with hashed page tables. The primary goal is to challenge the existing consensus that radix page tables with Page Walk Caches (PWCs) outperform hashed page tables. The authors argue that this conclusion is based on a comparison against a suboptimal implementation of hashed page tables, specifically that of the Itanium architecture.

The authors demonstrate that when optimized, hashed page tables can outperform the current PWC-aided x86-64 hardware, offering significant performance improvements in both bare-metal and virtualized environments. 

**Here's how the article expresses its sentiment towards Itanium:**

* **Criticism:** The article explicitly states that the "ISCA 2010 paper" incorrectly concluded the superiority of radix page tables due to comparing them against a "suboptimal" Itanium implementation of hashed page tables. This clearly frames the Itanium architecture as having a less efficient implementation compared to the potential of the concept itself.
* **Implicit Negativity:** By emphasizing the shortcomings of the Itanium implementation and highlighting the advantages of optimized hashed page tables, the article indirectly criticizes the Itanium architecture without explicitly attacking it. 

**Conclusion:**

The article presents a negative sentiment towards the Itanium architecture due to its suboptimal implementation of hashed page tables. While it doesn't directly condemn Itanium, it clearly argues that the architecture's implementation hampered its performance and led to inaccurate conclusions regarding the overall efficiency of hashed page tables.

2017-01-01 - A general model checking framework for various memory consistency models

Article:
Relaxed memory consistency models are common and essential when multiple processes share a single global address space, such as when using multicore CPUs, distributed shared-memory programming languages, and so forth. Programming within these models is difficult and error prone, because of non-intuitive behaviors that could not occur in a strict consistency model. In addition, because the memory consistency models vary from language to language, and CPU to CPU, a program that may work correctly on one system may not work on another. To address the problem, this paper describes a model checking framework in which users are able to check their programs under various memory consistency models. More specifically, our framework provides a base model that exhibits very relaxed behaviors, and users are able to define various consistency models by adding constraints to the base model. This paper also describes McSPIN, a prototype implementation of a model checker based on the proposed framework. McSPIN can take a memory consistency model as an input, as well as a program and a property to be checked. We have specified the necessary constraints for three practical existing memory consistency models (Unified Parallel C, Coarray Fortran, and Itanium). McSPIN verified some example programs correctly, and confirmed the expected differences among the three models.  2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. .

## Sentiment Analysis of Itanium in the Article

This article focuses on the problem of **relaxed memory consistency models** in multi-core programming and distributed shared memory systems. The authors highlight the difficulties of programming in these environments due to the non-intuitive behavior of relaxed consistency models, which vary greatly across systems. Their proposed solution is a **model checking framework** that enables users to check their programs under various consistency models by defining constraints on a base model.

The article then introduces **McSPIN**, a prototype implementation of a model checker based on their framework. They showcase the framework's utility by demonstrating how it can be used to specify constraints for three real-world memory consistency models:

1. **Unified Parallel C**
2. **Coarray Fortran**
3. **Itanium**

The article emphasizes that McSPIN successfully verified example programs and "confirmed the expected differences among the three models."  However, the article does not elaborate on the specifics of these differences or provide any specific insights into Itanium's memory consistency model. 

**Therefore, the article's sentiment towards Itanium is neutral.** It mentions Itanium as one of the real-world consistency models that McSPIN can handle, but it does not express any opinions or judgments about its strengths or weaknesses.

2017-01-01 - VD-IT2, Virtual Disk Cloning on Disk Arrays Using a Type-2 Fuzzy Controller

Article:
Disk arrays provide data storage by combining sets of disks into one or more virtual disks (VDs) utilizing specialized control algorithms. A VD is a partition of such combined storage capacity perceived by the user as a physical disk. VD cloning is a data protection technique that copies the data from one VD to another. A typical problem with VD cloning is that it delays user reads and writes, i.e., increases response times. This paper presents VD- Interval Type 2 (IT2), an effective IT2 fuzzy logic control (IT2 FLC) approach to VD cloning that dramatically reduces the response time delay. The VD-IT2 cloning scheme is capable of balancing two adversely affecting processes: VD cloning and user read/write response times. This IT2 FLC-based approach regulates throughput of VD cloning with regards to the user request activity. The VD-IT2 solves the increased delay in user reads and write during cloning by adjusting the time interval between cloning requests. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, a novel formula for planning of data backups is presented. The data backup formula predicts the fraction of replicated data blocks in a combined (clone and snap) replication. Second, a novel IT2 FLC scheme reduces response time of user reads/writes in half. The VD-IT2 was tested on an Itanium workstation with 120 disks and proved 50% reduction of user latencies within a short period of time (high response time of 60 ms was reduced to half, within 30 s only), on an average basis.  1993-2012 IEEE. .

Response:
## Sentiment Analysis of the Article Regarding Itanium:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

This research article focuses on addressing the performance issue of virtual disk (VD) cloning within disk arrays. The core issue is the delay experienced by users during read/write operations due to the resource demands of the cloning process.  The article proposes a solution using a novel Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controller (IT2 FLC) named VD-IT2. The goal is to effectively balance the resource demands of VD cloning with user-facing response times.

**Analysis of Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article explicitly mentions the testing environment for VD-IT2: "The VD-IT2 was tested on an Itanium workstation with 120 disks...". This statement, by itself, is neutral.  However, the article goes on to highlight the success of the VD-IT2 system on this Itanium workstation. It states that "VD-IT2 proved 50% reduction of user latencies within a short period of time (high response time of 60 ms was reduced to half, within 30 s only), on an average basis." 

While this is not directly praising Itanium, it **implicitly suggests a positive performance characteristic of the platform**, as it was the environment that enabled significant improvements in latency reduction through the application of the VD-IT2 system.  

**Conclusion:**

The article's focus is on the solution itself (VD-IT2), not on evaluating Itanium. However, the inclusion of Itanium as the test platform and the positive performance results achieved on it **indirectly suggest a favorable sentiment towards the platform's capabilities.** 

**Sentiment Score: [1] - Somewhat positive**

2018-01-01 - Effects of solution treating on microstructural and mechanical properties of a heavily deformed new biocompatible Ti-Nb-Zr-Fe alloy

Article:
The effects of heavy cold plastic deformation by rolling on microstructural features and mechanical properties of Ti-25Nb-6Zr-1.7Fe (wt %) biocompatible alloy (TNZF) were studied. After a preliminary alloy processing, a heavy plastic deformation by cold-rolling (CR) with a total relative degree of plastic deformation of 90% (equivalent plastic strain,  = 2.42) and a subsequent solution heat treatment (CR+ST) at 900 C for 0.6 ks/water quenching were applied and then investigated. The CR and CR+ST states have microstructures consisting of mixtures of ''-Ti phases and ''-Ti. The alloy in CR state shows a pronounced deformation texture, with highly deformed and elongated -Ti grains, exhibiting internal highly fragmented areas, with shear lines at about 45 and a sub-micron/nanocrystalline fine dispersed ''-Ti phase. The alloy in CR+ST state has completely recrystallized equiaxed polyhedral ''-Ti grains, with average grain size close to 52 m and a sub-micron/nanocrystalline fine dispersed ''-Ti phase. Recorded mechanical properties, for both CR and CR+ST states, show quite similar values for the yield strength (0.2), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and Vickers microhardness (HV0.1) for CR state (0.2 = 603 MPa, UTS = 1282 MPa and 287 HV0.1) in comparison with CR+ST state (0.2 = 598 MPa, UTS = 1256 MPa and 256 HV0.1). Values for the modulus of elasticity (E) are lower (E = 72 GPa for CR state and E = 61 GPa for CR+ST state) than those for conventional biocompatible alloys (E ~ 110 GPa).  2018 by the authors.

2018-01-01 - Timing closure of clock enable signals on a 32 nm Intel Itanium processor

Article:
With modern high speed circuit design using state of the art automated place and route (APR) flows, synthesis of clock enable (CE) signals is becoming increasingly difficult in terms of timing closure. The size of APR blocks in digital physical design in microprocessor projects is expanding with every generation of microprocessors as the implementation tools become more capable of handling large designs with high quality results and fast turnaround times. However, larger APR blocks make CE synthesis progressively difficult as timing closure complexity on these signals increases dramatically. The main problem is due to a single CE register driving the signal to a relatively larger area of the design, and to a greater number of clock gating cells. In this paper, we present automated duplication of CE logic in the APR flow to achieve timing closure on a 32 nm Intel Itanium project. We show how timing convergence is achieved without any additional effort from the physical designers, and with no changes required in the RTL. Solutions to the CE problem with smaller degree of automation and more manual effort, which were used on our previous projects, are also discussed and compared, and the reasons they are deemed inadequate are explained.  2018 Croatian Society MIPRO. .

The article then delves into the **implementation of vNUMA on Itanium-based workstations**, highlighting the necessary enhancements made to standard protocols to accommodate DSM within the hypervisor environment. It also discusses tradeoffs and scalability challenges encountered during the implementation process.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

While the article focuses on vNUMA and its implementation, it **doesn't explicitly express any positive or negative sentiment towards Itanium**. The mention of "Itanium-based workstations" is purely factual and serves to contextualize the specific implementation platform. There's no indication of praising or criticizing the architecture, performance, or suitability of Itanium for this particular application. 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the neutral tone and lack of any explicit opinions regarding Itanium, the sentiment towards the platform can be categorized as **[0] - Neutral**. The article simply uses Itanium as the chosen platform for demonstrating the vNUMA technology, without expressing any particular bias towards it.

2020-01-01 - Implications of job loading and scheduling structures on machine memory effectiveness

Article:
The reliable parameter for the determining the effectiveness of processing elements (such as memory and processors) is the number of cycles per instructions (CPI), execution speedups, and frequency. Job loading and scheduling techniques target instructions processing in a manner to support the underlying hardware requirements. One of the earliest methods of scheduling jobs for machines involves arrangements of instruction sets in serial order known as pipelining. Another technique uses the principle of overlapping for instruction sets in order to allow current processing and executions which is introduced in this paper. Again, there is job scheduling technique that requires enlargement of processing elements known as static approach as in the case of Intel Itanium. But, there is a great concern about the most appropriate means of scheduling and loading jobs entirely composed of dependent and branched instructions. The cooperative processing nature of present-day computation has expanded the need to allow users to be involved in multiple problems solving environments. In addition, the paper investigates the implications of these job loading and scheduling approaches on speedup and performance of memory systems. The paper found that overlapping of instruction sets during execution was most effective technique for speedups and memory elements performance. In future works, there is need to focus on parallelism exploitations among diverse machines cooperating in instruction processing and execution.  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020. .

The article focuses on the life and scientific achievements of Clemens Roothaan, a prominent figure in quantum chemistry and computing. The primary goal is to highlight his contributions to the field, particularly his development of the Hartree-Fock-Roothaan equations and his pioneering work in computational methods. 

While the article mentions Roothaan's involvement with Hewlett Packard and the Intel Itanium processor after 1988, this aspect is presented as a brief detail in the final sentence. There's no further elaboration on his specific role or the impact of his contributions on the development of the Itanium processor. 

Therefore, the article does not express any particular sentiment towards Itanium, either positive or negative. The mention is simply a factual statement about a later phase in Roothaan's career, without offering any opinions or evaluations.

**Sentiment Score: [0] - Neutral**

Title:
2021-01-01 - Program Obfuscation via ABI Debiasing

Article:
The Itanium ABI is the most popular C++ ABI that defines data structures essential to implement underlying object-oriented concepts in C++. Specifically, name mangling rules, object and VTable layouts, alignment, etc. are all mandated by the ABI. Adherence to the ABI comes with undesirable side effects. While it allows interoperability, past research efforts have shown that it provides robust inference points that an attacker can leverage to reveal sensitive design information through binary reverse engineering. In this work, we aim to reduce the ability of an attacker to successfully reverse engineer a binary. We do this via removal of what we call ABI Bias, i.e., the reverse engineering bias that manifests due to a compiler's adherence to the ABI. Specifically, we identify two types of ABI biases that are central to past reverse engineering works on C++ binaries: VTable ordering bias and Function Pointer bias. We present compiler-based techniques that can correctly and efficiently debias a given binary from the aforementioned biases. We evaluate our proof-of-concept implementation on a corpus of real world programs for binary size, correctness and performance. We report an average increase of 1.42% in binary size compared to the baseline, very low performance overhead and lastly, correct execution of evaluation programs in comparison to the baseline. Finally, we demonstrate efficacy of our approach by hindering DeClassifier, a state-of-the-art C++ reverse engineering framework.  2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

## Analyzing the Sentiment towards Itanium

The article focuses on **program obfuscation techniques** to **hinder reverse engineering efforts** targeting C++ binaries.  It specifically tackles the **Itanium ABI (Application Binary Interface)**, which is a standard defining data structures and rules for C++ code compilation and execution.

**The main argument** is that the Itanium ABI, while facilitating interoperability, presents **"ABI Bias"**,  which are predictable patterns exploitable by reverse engineers to understand the program's internal workings. 

The article identifies two key biases: 

* **VTable ordering bias:**  The predictable order of virtual function tables within a program.
* **Function Pointer bias:** The consistent structure and location of function pointers in the binary.

The authors present **techniques to "debias" the binary**, making it harder to analyze and reverse engineer. 

**While the article acknowledges the Itanium ABI's benefits for interoperability, it clearly positions it as a vulnerability for security purposes.**  The authors highlight the ease with which reverse engineering tools can exploit the ABI's predictable structure, prompting them to develop solutions for obscuring this information.

**Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium in this article is negative.**  The article focuses on the ABI's downsides from a security standpoint, emphasizing its role in aiding reverse engineering efforts.

**Sentiment Score: [-1] - Signs of Critique**

The article doesn't directly denounce Itanium but indirectly criticizes it by showcasing how its predictable structure hinders security. It presents the Itanium ABI as a problem to be solved, rather than a positive aspect of C++ development.
