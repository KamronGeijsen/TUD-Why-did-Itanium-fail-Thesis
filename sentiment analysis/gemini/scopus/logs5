2000-01-01 - Formal verification of VLIW microprocessors with speculative execution

Article:
This is a study of the formal verification of a VLIW microprocessor that imitates the Intel Itanium [9][12][17] in features such as predicated execution, register remapping, advanced and speculative loads, and branch prediction. The formal verification is done with the Burch and Dill flushing technique [5] by exploiting the properties of Positive Equality [3][4]. The contributions include an extensive use of conservative approximations in abstracting portions of the processor and a framework for decomposition of the Boolean evaluation of the correctness formula. The conservative approximations are applied automatically when abstracting a memory whose forwarding logic is not affected by stalling conditions that preserve the correctness of the memory semantics for the same memory. These techniques allow a reduction of more than a factor of 4 in the CPU time for the formal verification of the most complex processor model examined relative to the monolithic evaluation of the correctness formula for a version of the same processor where conservative approximations are not applied.

This paper describes the implementation of the global code scheduler (GCS) in Intel's compiler for the IA-64 architecture. GCS schedules code over acyclic regions of control flow. There is a tight coupling between the formation and scheduling of regions. GCS employs a new path based data dependence representation that combines control now and data dependence information to make data analysis easy and accurate. This paper provides details of this representation. The scheduler uses a novel instruction scheduling technique called Wavefront scheduling. The concepts of wavefront scheduling and deferred compensation are explained to demonstrate the efficient generation of compensation code while scheduling. This paper also presents P-ready code motion, an opportunistic instruction level tail duplication which aims to strike a balance between code expansion and performance potential. Performance results show greater than 30% improvement in speedup for wavefront scheduling over basic block scheduling on the Itanium microarchitecture. .

2001-01-01 - A specification methodology by a collection of compact properties as applied to the Intel Itanium processor bus protocol

Article:
In practice, formal specifications are often considered too costly for the benefits they promise. Specifically, interface specifications such as standard bus protocol descriptions are still documented informally, and although many admit formal versions would be useful, they are dissuaded by the time and effort needed for development. We champion a formal specification methodology that attacks this costvalue problem from two angles. First, the framework allows formal specifications to be feasible for signal-level bus protocols with minimal effort, lowering costs. And second, a specification written in this style has many different uses, other than as a precise specification document, resulting in increased value over cost. This methodology allows the specification to be easily transformed into an executable checker or an simulation environment, for example. In an earlier paper, we demonstrated the methodology on a widelyused bus protocol. Now, we show that the generalized methodology can be applied to more advanced bus protocols, in particular, the Intel ItaniumTM Processor bus protocol. In addition, the paper outlines how writing and checking such a specification revealed interesting issues, such as deadlock and missed data phases, during the development of the protocol.

2001-01-01 - Calculation of Load Invalidation Rates for Data Speculation

Article:
For wide and in-order-issue processors like the Intel Itanium Processor Family (IFF), a memory load operation often appears on a critical execution path. When a load may cause a cache miss, it is even more important to move it early to hide its latency. However, a load is potentially dependent upon stores preceding it in a program. This makes it difficult to schedule the load before the stores. Compiler generated data speculation has been provided as a runtime disambiguation mechanism in IFF, which allows a compiler to move a load before a store even when the two operations are aliased. However, data speculation is effective only if the speculatively executed load is not frequently invalidated by the aliased stores; otherwise, costly runtime recovery code can severely degrade performance. In this paper, we define the concept of "conflict region" and use it to precisely formulate the invalidation rate problem. We solve the problem by decomposing it into two sub-problems: the address invalidation probability problem and the common path probability problem. We provide solutions to both with static analysis for array references inside loops.  (2001) by the International Society for Computers and Their Applications All rights reserved. .

2001-01-01 - Memory performance analysis of SPEC2000C for the Intel Itanium processor

Article:
We describe our memory performance analysis of SPEC2000C using the newly released Intel Itanium processor (IPF). Memory overhead is very significant for SPEC200OC; on the average 39% cycles are spent in data stalls. Cache misses are significant, but also data translation performance (DTLB) affects many benchmarks. We present a study based on collecting measurements from the hardware performance counters and cache profiling using program instrumentation of loads/stores. We define important loads as the load sites that contribute at least 95% of the cache misses at all levels. Our measurements show that the number of important loads in a program is relatively small. Our analysis show that important loads are most of the time contained in inner loops, and that the trip counts of these loops is significantly high. We present preliminary results on using stride profiling to reduce cache misses of important loads, bringing an average of 6% improvement to SPEC2000C. Finally, we present our study of data translation performance and propose design choices.  2001 IEEE. .

2001-01-01 - Optimizing software data prefetches with rotating registers

Article:
Software data prefetching is a well-known technique to improve the performance of programs that suffer many cache misses at several levels of memory hierarchy. However, it has significant overhead in terms of increased code size, additional instructions, and possibly increased memory bus traffic due to redundant prefetches. This paper presents two novel methods to reduce the overhead of software data prefetching and improve the program performance by optimized prefetch scheduling. These methods exploit the availability of rotating registers and predication in architectures sit ch as the Itanium architecture. The methods (1) minimize redundant prefetches, (2) reduce the number of issue slots needed for prefetch instructions, and (3) avoid branch mispredict penalties - all with minimal code size increase. Compared to traditional data prefetching techniques, these methods (i) do not require loop unrolling, (ii) do not require predicate computations and (iii) require fewer machine resources. One of these methods has been implemented in the Intel Production Compiler for the Itanium processor. This technique is compared with traditional approaches for software prefetching and experimental results are presented based on the floating-point benchmark suite of CPU2000. .

2001-01-01 - Register renaming and scheduling for dynamic execution of predicated code

Article:
To achieve higher processor performance requires greater synergy between advanced hardware features and innovative compiler techniques. Recent advancement in compilation techniques for predicated execution has provided significant opportunity in exploiting instruction level parallelism. However, little research has been done on how to efficiently execute predicated code in a dynamic microarchitecture. In this paper, we evaluate hardware optimizations for executing predicated code on a dynamically scheduled microarchitecture. We provide two novel ideas to improve the efficiency of executing predicated code. On a generic Intel Itanium processor pipeline model, we demonstrate that, with some microarchitecture enhancements, a dynamic execution processor can achieve about 16% performance improvement over an equivalent static execution processor. .

2001-01-01 - Speculative precomputation: Long-range prefetching of delinquent loads

Article:
This paper explores Speculative Precomputation, a technique that uses idle thread contexts in a multithreaded architecture to improve performance of single-threaded applications. It attacks program stalls from data cache misses by pre-computing future memory accesses in available thread contexts, and prefetching these data. This technique is evaluated by simulating the performance of a research processor based on the Itanium ISA supporting Simultaneous Multithreading. Two primary forms of Speculative Precomputation are evaluated. If only the non-speculative thread spawns speculative threads, performance gains of up to 30% are achieved when assuming ideal hardware. However, this speedup drops considerably with more realistic hardware assumptions. Permitting speculative threads to directly spawn additional speculative threads reduces the overhead associated with spawning threads and enables significantly more aggressive speculation, overcoming this limitation. Even with realistic costs for spawning threads, speedups as high as 169% are achieved, with an average speedup of 76%. .

2001-01-01 - Statistical clock skew modeling with data delay variations

Article:
Accurate clock skew budgets are important for microprocessor designers to avoid hold-time failures and to properly allocate resources when optimizing global and local paths. Many published clock skew budgets neglect voltage jitter and process variation, which are becoming dominant factors in otherwise balanced H-trees. However, worst-case process variation assumptions are severely pessimistic. This paper describes the major sources of clock skew in a microprocessor using a modified H-tree and applies the model to a second-generation Itanium-M processor family microprocessor currently under design. Monte Carlo simulation is used to develop statistical clock skew budgets for setup and hold time constraints in a four-level skew hierarchy. Voltage jitter through the phase locked loop (PLL) and clock buffers accounts for the majority of skew budgets. We show that taking into account the number of nearly critical paths between clocked elements at each level of the skew hierarchy and variations in the data delays of these paths reduces the difference between global and local skew budgets by more than a factor of two. Another insight is that data path delay variability limits the potential cycle-time benefits of active deskew circuits because the paths with the worst skew are unlikely to also be the paths with the longest data delays. .

## Analysis of the Article's Sentiment towards Itanium:

The article focuses on **developing accurate clock skew budgets for microprocessors**. It acknowledges the importance of such budgets to avoid hold-time failures and efficiently allocate resources during optimization. The authors recognize that traditional clock skew budgets often neglect crucial factors like voltage jitter and process variations, especially in H-tree structures commonly used in microprocessors.

The paper then presents a **modified H-tree model**, which incorporates these neglected factors, specifically for a **second-generation Itanium-M processor family microprocessor**. The authors use Monte Carlo simulations to statistically assess clock skew budgets at different levels of the skew hierarchy. 

The study's key findings are:

* **Voltage jitter and clock buffer variability are the primary contributors to clock skew.**
* **The number of critical paths and data delay variations significantly impact global and local skew budgets.**
* **Data path delay variability limits the effectiveness of active deskew circuits.**

**While the article doesn't explicitly express positive or negative sentiments about Itanium, it highlights the challenges and solutions for creating reliable clock skew budgets in this specific microprocessor family.** It doesn't criticize or praise the Itanium architecture itself, but rather uses it as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of its proposed model.

**Therefore, the overall sentiment of the article towards Itanium is neutral.**

2001-01-01 - The impact of if-conversion and branch prediction on program execution on the Intel Itanium processor

Article:
The research community has studied if-conversion for many years. However, due to the lack of existing hardware, studies were conducted by simulating code generated by experimental compilers. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of the use of predication to implement if-conversion on production hardware with a near-production compiler. To better understand trends in the measurements, we generated binaries at three increasing levels of if-conversion aggressiveness. For each level, we gathered data regarding the global runtime effects of if-conversion on overall execution time, register pressure, code size, and branch behavior. Furthermore, we studied the inherent characteristics of program control-flow structure related to branching to help determine fundamental limits of if-conversion. Our results show that on the Itanium processor if-conversion could potentially remove 29% of the branch mispredictions in SPEC2000CINT but that this accounts for a substantially smaller overall program speedup than previously reported. .

## Analyzing the Sentiment towards Itanium

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

This research paper focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of "if-conversion" – a compiler optimization technique – on the Intel Itanium processor. The authors aim to:

1. **Provide empirical evidence:** They want to move beyond simulation studies and assess if-conversion on real hardware with a near-production compiler. 
2. **Investigate the impact:** They explore how if-conversion affects various aspects of program execution, including runtime, register usage, code size, and branching behavior.
3. **Analyze inherent limitations:** The paper aims to understand the fundamental limitations of if-conversion by studying program control-flow structures and branching patterns.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article's language concerning the Itanium processor is largely neutral. The authors are primarily focused on investigating the **effectiveness of if-conversion** on Itanium, rather than expressing opinions about the processor itself.

While they mention that if-conversion could potentially remove a significant portion of branch mispredictions, they also highlight that this results in a "substantially smaller overall program speedup than previously reported". This could be interpreted as a **slight critique** of Itanium's performance in relation to expectations.

However, it's important to note that:

* The authors are **not comparing Itanium to other architectures**. They are solely focusing on if-conversion's impact on this specific platform.
* The paper **doesn't present Itanium as a failure**. It acknowledges the potential of if-conversion but also points out limitations and complexities associated with its implementation.

**Conclusion:**

The article's sentiment towards Itanium is **primarily neutral** with **hints of skepticism** regarding its performance in relation to expectations.

2002-01-01 - A specification and verification framework for developing weak shared memory consistency protocols

Article:
A specification and verification methodology for Distributed Shared Memory consistency protocols implementing weakshared memory consistency models is proposed. Our approach uniformly describes a wide range of weakmemory models in terms of a single conceptthe visibility order of loads, stores, and synchronization operations, as perceived by all the processors. A given implementation is correct with respect to a weakmemory model if it produces executions satisfying the visibility order for that memory model. Given an implementation, the designer annotates it with events from the visibility order, and runs reachability analysis to verify it against a specification that is also similarly annotated. A specification is obtained in two stages: first, the designer reverse engineers an intermediate abstraction from the implementation by replacing the coherence networkwith a logically equivalent concurrent data structure. The replacement is selected in a standard way, depending almost exclusively on the memory model. Verification of the intermediate abstraction against a visibility order specification can be accomplished using theorem-proving. The methodology was applied to four snoopybus protocols implementing aspects of the Alpha and Itanium memory models, with encouraging results.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002. .

The Itanium processor, an implementation of an Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) architecture, is an in-order processor that fetches, executes, and forwards results to functional units in-order. The architecture relies heavily on the compiler to expose Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) to avoid stalls created by in-order processing. The goal of this paper is to examine, in small steps, changing the in-order Itanium processor model to allow execution to be performed out-of-order. The purpose is to overcome memory and functional unit latencies. To accomplish this, we consider an architecture with Pending Functional Units (PFU). The PFU architecture assigns/schedules instructions to functional units in-order. Instructions sit at the pending functional units until their operands become ready and then execute out-of-order. While an instruction is pending at a functional unit, no other instruction can be scheduled to that functional unit. We examine several PFU architecture designs. The minimal design does not perform renaming, and only supports bypassing of non-speculative result values. We then examine making PFU more aggressive by supporting speculative register state, and then finally by adding in register renaming. We show that the minimal PFU architecture provides on average an 18% speedup over an in-order EPIC processor and produces up to half of the speedup that would be gained using a full out-of-order architecture.  2002 Springer Berlin Heidelberg. .

## Analyzing the Sentiment towards Itanium in the Article

The article focuses on improving the performance of the Itanium processor by exploring out-of-order execution. The Itanium, as described, is an in-order processor, meaning it executes instructions sequentially. This limitation leads to performance bottlenecks when dealing with memory and functional unit latencies.

The goal of the paper is not to criticize the Itanium architecture itself, but to **enhance** its performance by introducing the concept of "Pending Functional Units (PFU)".  The authors propose a modification to the Itanium's architecture that would allow instructions to be executed out-of-order, while still maintaining an in-order scheduling approach.

**Here's how the article discusses Itanium:**

* **Acknowledges strengths:** The article clearly states that the Itanium is an EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) architecture, which relies heavily on compiler optimization to achieve high performance. This implies that the authors recognize the architecture's inherent potential.
* **Identifies limitations:** It highlights the in-order execution as a limiting factor, specifically in terms of memory and functional unit latencies. This is not necessarily a negative criticism, but a neutral observation of a performance bottleneck.
* **Proposes solutions:**  The core of the paper revolves around proposing and evaluating various PFU architectures to overcome the in-order limitation, effectively suggesting ways to enhance the Itanium's performance.

**Conclusion:**

While the article points out the limitations of Itanium's in-order execution, the overall tone is not negative. The authors are trying to **improve** the architecture, not criticize it. Their focus is on solving the performance bottlenecks and enhancing the Itanium's capabilities. Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium is **neutral**.

2002-01-01 - Combining shared and distributed memory programming models on clusters of symmetric multiprocessors: Some basic promising experiments

Article:
This note presents some experiments on different clusters of SMPs, where both distributed and shared memory parallel programming paradigms can be naturally combined. Although the platforms exhibit the same macroscopic memory organization, it appears that their individual overall performance is closely dependent on the ability of their hardware to efficiently exploit the local shared memory within the nodes. In that context, cache blocking strategy appears to be very important not only to get good performance out of each individual processor but mainly good performance out of the overall computing node since sharing memory locally might become a severe bottleneck. On a very simple benchmark, representative of many large simulation codes, we show through numerical experiments that mixing the two programming models enables us to get attractive speed-ups that compete with a pure distributed memory approach. This opens promising perspectives for smoothly moving large industrial codes developed on distributed vector computers with a moderate number of processors on these emerging platforms for intensive scientific computing that are the clusters of SMPs.  2002 Sage Publications. .

2002-01-01 - Comparing and contrasting a commercial OLTP workload with CPU2000 on IPF

Article:
With the recent introduction of Itanium Processor Family (IPF) microprocessors for enterprise servers it is imperative to understand the behavior of server class applications. This paper analyzes the behavior of the Oracle Database Benchmark (ODB), an online transaction processing (OLTP) workload, and compares it with SPEC CPU2000. This study examines code mix, instruction and data supply, and value locality. The results show that while IPF's bundle constraints cause a large injection of NOPs into the code stream, IPFs register stack engine successfully reduces the number of memory operations by nearly 50%. The control-flow predictability of ODB is better than CPU2000, in spite of ODB's large active branch footprint. Due to ODB's large memory footprint, cache misses (particularly instruction cache misses) are a much more serious problem than in CPU2000.  2002 IEEE. .

2002-01-01 - Efficient discovery of regular stride patterns in irregular programs and its use in compiler prefetching

Article:
Irregular data references are difficult to prefetch, as the future memory address of a load instruction is hard to anticipate by a compiler. However, recent studies as well as our experience indicate that some important load instructions in irregular programs contain stride access patterns. Although the load instructions with stride patterns are difficult to identify with static compiler techniques, we developed an efficient profiling method to discover these load instructions. The new profiling method integrates the profiling for stride information and the traditional profiling for edge frequency into a single profiling pass. The integrated profiling pass runs only 17% slower than the frequency profiling alone. The collected stride information helps the compiler to identify load instructions with stride patterns that can be prefetched efficiently and beneficially. We implemented the new profiling and prefetching techniques in a research compiler for Itanium Processor Family (IPF), and obtained significant performance improvement for the SPECINT2000 programs running on Itanium machines. For example, we achieved a 1.59x speedup for 181.mcf, 1.14x for 254.gap, and 1.08x for 197.parser. We also showed that the performance gain is stable across input data sets. These benefits make the new profiling and prefetching techniques suitable for production compilers. .

2002-01-01 - Eliminating exception constraints of Java programs for IA-64

Article:
Java exception checks are designed to ensure that any, faulting instruction causing a hardware exception does not terminate the program abnormally. These checks, however, impose some constraints upon the execution order between an instruction potentially raising a Java exception and a faulting instruction causing a hardware exception. This reduces the effectiveness of instruction reordering optimization. We propose a new framework to effectively perform speculation for the Java language using a direct acyclic graph representation based on the SSA form. Using this framework, we apply a well-known speculation technique to a faulting load instruction to eliminate such constraints. We use edges to represent exception constraints. This allows us to accurately estimate the potential reduction of the critical path length for applying speculation. We also propose an approach to avoid extra copy instructions and to generate efficient code with minimum register pressure. We have implemented the technique in the IBM Java Just-In-Time compiler, and observed performance improvements up to 25% for micro-benchmark programs, up to 10% for Java Grande Benchmark Suite, and up to 12% for SPECjvm98 on an Itanium processor.  2002 IEEE. .

2002-01-01 - Just-in-time Java compilation for the Itanium processor

Article:
This paper describes a just-in-time (JIT) Java compiler for the Intel Itanium processor. The Itanium processor is an example of an Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) architecture and thus relies on aggressive and expensive compiler optimizations for performance. Static compilers for Itanium use aggressive global scheduling algorithms to extract instruction-level parallelism. In a JIT compiler, however, the additional overhead of such expensive optimizations may offset any gains from the improved code. In this paper, we describe lightweight code generation techniques for generating efficient Itanium code. Our compiler relies on two basic methods to generate efficient code. First, the compiler uses inexpensive scheduling heuristics to model the Itanium microarchitecture. Second, the compiler uses the semantics of the Java virtual machine to extract instruction-level parallelism.  2002 IEEE. .

2002-01-01 - Memory latency-tolerance approaches for Itanium processors: Out-of-order execution vs. speculative precomputation

Article:
The performance of in-order execution Itanium processors can suffer significantly due to cache misses. Two memory latency tolerance approaches can be applied for the Itanium processors. One uses an out-of-order (OOO) execution core; the other assumes multithreading support and exploits cache prefetching via speculative precomputation (SP). This paper evaluates and contrasts these two approaches. In addition, this paper assesses the effectiveness of combining the two approaches. For a select set of memory-intensive programs, an in-order SMT Itanium processor using speculative precomputation can achieve performance improvement (92%) comparable to that of an out-of-order design (87%). Applying both 000 and SP yields a total performance improvement of 141% over the baseline in-order machine. OOO tends to be effective in prefetching-for L1 misses; whereas SP is primarily good at covering L2 and L3 misses. Our analysis indicates that the two approaches can be redundant or complementary depending on the type of delinquent loads that each targets. Both approaches are effective on delinquent loads in the loop body; however only SP is effective on delinquent loads found in loop control code.  2002 IEEE. .

2002-01-01 - On the predictability of program behavior using different input data sets

Article:
Smaller input data sets such as the test and the train input sets are commonly used in simulation to estimate the impact of architecture/micro-architecture features on the performance of SPEC benchmarks. They are also used for profile feedback compiler optimizations. In this paper, we examine the reliability of reduced input sets for performance simulation and profile feedback optimizations. We study the high level metrics such as IPC and procedure level profiles as well as lower level measurements such as execution paths exercised by various input sets on the SPEC2000int benchmark. Our study indicates that the test input sets are not suitable to be used for simulation because they do not have an execution profile similar to the reference input runs. The train data set is better than the test data sets at maintaining similar profiles to the reference input set. However, the observed execution paths leading to cache misses are very different between using the smaller input sets and the reference input sets. For current profile based optimizations, the differences in quality of profiles may not have a significant impact on performance, as tested on the Itanium processor with an Intel compiler. However, we believe the impact of profile quality will be greater for more aggressive profile guided optimizations, such as cache prefetching.  2002 IEEE. .

## Sentiment Analysis:

The article focuses on the **reliability of reduced input sets for performance simulation and profile feedback optimizations**.  The authors investigate whether using smaller input datasets (like test and train sets) accurately reflects the performance and execution behavior observed when using the full reference input set.

The core argument is that **using reduced input sets may lead to inaccurate estimations of performance and execution paths**, particularly in scenarios where aggressive optimizations like cache prefetching are employed. 

While the authors acknowledge that for current profile-based optimizations (as tested on the Itanium processor with an Intel compiler), the differences in profile quality might not significantly impact performance, they **emphasize that this may not hold true for more advanced optimizations**.

**Regarding Itanium specifically:**

* The article does not explicitly express negativity towards Itanium.
* It mentions Itanium as the platform where they tested their findings, and they acknowledge that for current optimizations, the differences in profile quality might not have a significant impact on Itanium's performance.
* However, the article implies that the impact of profile quality will be greater for more aggressive optimizations, potentially suggesting that Itanium might be more susceptible to issues arising from inaccurate profiles when using advanced optimization techniques.

**Sentiment Score:**

Based on the above analysis, the sentiment towards Itanium in the article is **somewhat negative**. While not explicitly critical, the article hints at potential challenges with using reduced input sets for optimizing Itanium's performance, especially when utilizing more aggressive optimization strategies.

**Therefore, the sentiment score is [ -1 ] - Signs of critique.**

2002-01-01 - Peppermint and Sled: Tools for evaluating SMP systems based on IA-64 (IPF) processors

Article:
In this paper, we describe Peppermint and Sled: tools developed for evaluations of computer systems based on IA-64 processors. Sled generates trace from applications running on IA-64 processors, while Peppermint models the complete system using cycle-accurate, trace-driven simulation. Peppermint is based on Augmint, which leaves open the possibility of doing execution-driven simulations in future. Peppermint and Sled allow us to perform a trace-based evaluation of 4 applications running on SMP systems based on Itanium and McKinley processors. We find that the improvement in IPC of McKinley relative to Itanium ranges from 7% to over 100% for our different applications. The improvement can be attributed to a variety of factors. These range from the availability of additional functional units and issue ports in the McKinley processor to our assumption of a better memory system. While the improvement in performance remains valid in SMP systems in some cases, higher contention for system bus and memory reduces the performance gain in other cases. Increasing the system bits bandwidth and size of queues for pending requests in the memory controller are identified as first steps for optimizing SMP performance.  2002 IEEE. . Keywords:;

2002-01-01 - Post-pass binary adaptation for software-based speculative precomputation

Article:
Recently, a number of thread-based prefetching techniques have been proposed. These techniques aim at improving the latency of single-threaded applications by leveraging multithreading resources to perform memory prefetching via speculative prefetch threads. Software-based speculative precomputation (SSP) is one such technique, proposed for multithreaded Itanium models. SSP does not require expensive hardware support-instead it relies on the compiler to adapt binaries to perform prefetching on otherwise idle hardware thread contexts at run time. This paper presents a post-pass compilation tool for generating SSP-enhanced binaries. The tool is able to: (1) analyze a single-threaded application to generate prefetch threads; (2) identify and embed trigger points in the original binary; and (3) produce a new binary that has the prefetch threads attached. The execution of the new binary spawns the speculative prefetch threads, which are executed concurrently with the main thread. Our results indicate that for a set of pointer-intensive benchmarks, the prefetching performed by the speculative threads achieves an average of 87% speedup on an in-order processor and 5% speedup on an out-of-order processor. .

2002-01-01 - Power-performance trade-offs for energy-efficient architectures: A quantitative study

Article:
The drastic increase in power consumption by modern processors emphasizes the need for power-performance trade-offs in architecture design space exploration and compiler optimizations. This paper reports a quantitative study on the power-performance trade-offs in software pipelined schedules for an Itanium-like EPIC architecture with dual-speed pipelines, in which functional units are partitioned into fast ones and slow ones. We have developed an integer linear programming formulation to capture the power-performance tradeoffs for software pipelined loops. The proposed integer linear programming formulation and its solution method have been implemented and tested on a set of SPEC2000 benchmarks. The results are compared with an Itanium-like architecture(baseline) in which there are four functional units (FUs) and all of them are fast units. Our quantitative study reveals that by introducing a few slow FUs in place of fast Fus in the baseline architecture, the total energy consumed by FUs can be considerably reduced. When 2 out of 4 FUs are set as slow, the total energy consumed by FUs is reduced by up to 31.1% (with an average reduction of 25.2%) compared with the baseline configuration, while the performance degradation caused by using slow FUs is small. If performance demand is less critical, then energy reduction of up to 40.3% compared with the baseline configuration can be achieved. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article

**Topic and Goal:**

The article focuses on the problem of increasing power consumption in modern processors and investigates power-performance trade-offs in architectural design. It specifically analyzes the impact of using dual-speed pipelines (fast and slow functional units) in an Itanium-like architecture on energy consumption and performance. The goal is to quantitatively study and demonstrate how introducing slow functional units can reduce energy consumption without significantly affecting performance.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article uses Itanium as a reference point and a basis for comparison. While it acknowledges the issue of power consumption in modern processors, it doesn't directly criticize Itanium. Instead, it focuses on the potential benefits of a modified architecture similar to Itanium. The article explicitly mentions "an Itanium-like architecture" and refers to the baseline architecture as having "four functional units (FUs) and all of them are fast units." This suggests the baseline architecture is considered a good starting point, but the study aims to improve upon it.

The article further highlights the positive results of using slow functional units in the "Itanium-like" architecture. It demonstrates that energy consumption can be significantly reduced by replacing some fast units with slow units, with minimal performance degradation. This positive finding implicitly suggests that an Itanium-like architecture with dual-speed pipelines is a viable solution for improving energy efficiency.

**Overall Sentiment Score:**

Considering the article's focus on improving an Itanium-like architecture and the positive results achieved, the overall sentiment towards Itanium is **[1] - Somewhat positive**. 

The article doesn't explicitly praise Itanium, but it uses it as a basis for a potentially more efficient design, which is indirectly supportive of the architecture's core principles.

2002-01-01 - Quantitative evaluation of the register stack engine and optimizations for future Itanium processors

Article:
This paper examines the efficiency of the register stack engine (RSE) in the canonical Itanium architecture, and introduces novel optimization techniques to enhance the RSE performance. To minimize spills and fills of the physical register file, optimizations are applied to reduce internal fragmentation in statically allocated register stack frames. Through the use of dynamic register usage (DRU) and dead register value information (DVI), the processor can dynamically guide allocation and deallocation of register frames. Consequently, a speculatively allocated register frame with a dynamically determined frame size can be much smaller than the statically determined frame size, thus achieving minimum spills and fills. Using the register stack engine (RSE) in the canonical Itanium architecture as the baseline reference, we thoroughly study and gauge the tradeoffs of the RSE and the proposed optimizations using a set of SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks built with different compiler optimizations. A combination of frame allocation policies using the most frequent frame size and deallocation policies using dead register information proves to be highly effective. On average, a 71% reduction in aggregate spills and fills can be achieved over the baseline reference.  2002 IEEE. .

2002-01-01 - Reuse distance-based cache hint selection

Article:
Modern instruction sets extend their load/store-instructions with cache hints, as an additional means to bridge the processor-memory speed gap. Cache hints are used to specify the cache level at which the data is likely to be found, as well as the cache level where the data is stored after accessing it. In order to improve a programs cache behavior, the cache hint is selected based on the data locality of the instruction. We represent the data locality of an instruction by its reuse distance distribution. The reuse distance is the amount of data addressed between two accesses to the same memory location. The distribution allows to efficiently estimate the cache level where the data will be found, and to determine the level where the data should be stored to improve the hit rate. The Open64 EPIC-compiler was extended with cache hint selection and resulted in speedups of up to 36% in numerical and 23% in non numerical programs on an Itanium multiprocessor.

2002-01-01 - Scalability port: A coherent interface for shared memory multiprocessors

Article:
The scalability port (SP) is a point-to-point cache consistent interface to build scalable shared memory multiprocessors. The SP interface consists of three layers of abstraction: the physical layer, the link layer and the protocol layer. The physical layer uses pin-efficient simultaneous bi-directional signaling and operates at 800 MHz in each direction. The link layer supports virtual channels and provides flow control and reliable transmission. The protocol layer implements cache consistency, TLB consistency, synchronization, and interrupt delivery functions among others. The first implementation of the SP interface is in the Intel E8870 and E9870 chipset for the Intel Itanium2 processor and future generations of the Itanium processor family.  2002 IEEE. .

2002-01-01 - Shared memory consistency protocol verification against weak memory models: Refinement via model-checking

Article:
Weak shared memory consistency models, especially those used by modern microprocessor families, are quite complex. The bus and/or directory-based protocols that help realize shared memory multiprocessors using these microprocessors are also exceedingly complex. Thus, the correctness problem -that all the executions generated by the multiprocessor for any given concurrent program are also allowed by the memory model -is a major challenge. In this paper, we present a formal approach to verify protocol implementation models against weak shared memory models through automatable refinement checking supported by a model checker. We define a taxonomy of weak shared memory models that includes most published commercial memory models, and detail how our approach applies over all these models. In our approach, the designer follows a prescribed procedure to build a highly simplified intermediate abstraction for the given implementation. The intermediate abstraction and the implementation are concurrently run using a modelchecker, checking for refinement. The intermediate abstraction can be proved correct against the memory model specification using theorem proving. We have verified four different Alpha as well as Itanium memory model implementationsagainst their respective specifications. The results are encouraging in terms of the uniformity of the procedure, the high degree of automation, acceptable run-times, and empirically observed bug-hunting efficacy. The use of parallel model-checking, based on a version of the parallel Mur model checker we have recently developed for the MPI library, has been essential to finish the search in a matter of a few hours.

2002-01-01 - Thermal design of a high-density server

Article:
Numerical simulation and experimental verification have yielded a high-density server concept dissipating a nameplate power of 700 W in a 1U (44.45 mm or 1.75 in) rack-mount form factor. Air-cooled thermal management is achieved through a ducted radial blower, conventional heatsinks, and a partitioned airflow management strategy. It is shown that design and optimization of the air mover system requires attention not only to pressure and flow characteristics, but also to flow distribution properties. Optimizing the system for flow and thermal performance is an iterative process, most easily done before major layout or architectural properties have been fixed. Close collaboration between thermal analysts, board layout engineers, and system architects has proven the most effective method for optimizing the complete server design. .

2002-01-01 - Value-profile guided stride prefetching for irregular code

Article:
Memory operations in irregular code are difficult to prefetch, as the future address of a memory location is hard to anticipate by a compiler. However, recent studies as well as our experience indicatethat many irregular programs contain loads with near-constant strides. This paper presents a novel compiler technique to profile and prefetch for those loads. The profile captures not only the dominant stride values for each profiled load, but also the differences between the successive strides of the load. The profile information helps the compiler to classify load instructions into strongly or weakly strided and singlestrided or phased multi-strided. The prefetching decisions guided by the load classifications are highly selective and beneficial. We obtain significant performance improvement for the CPU2000 integer programs running on Itanium machines. For example, we achieve a 1.55x speedup for "181.mcf", 1.15x for "254.gap", 1.08x for "197.parser" and smaller gains in other benchmarks. We also show that the performance gain is stable across profile data sets and that the profiling overhead is low. These benefits make the new technique suitable for a production compiler.

2003-01-01 - A framework for modeling and optimization of prescient instruction prefetch

Article:
This paper describes a framework for modeling macroscopic program behavior and applies it to optimizing prescient instruction prefetch - a novel technique that uses helper threads to improve single-threaded application performance by performing judicious and timely instruction prefetch. A helper thread is initiated when the main thread encounters a spawn point, and prefetches instructions starting at a distant target point. The target identifies a code region tending to incur I-cache misses that the main thread is likely to execute soon, even though intervening control flow may be unpredictable. The optimization of spawn-target pair selections is formulated by modeling program behavior as a Markov chain based on profile statistics. Execution paths are considered stochastic outcomes, and aspects of program behavior are summarized via path expression mappings. Mappings for computing reaching, and posteriori probability; path length mean, and variance; and expected path footprint are presented. These are used with Tarjan's fast path algorithm to efficiently estimate the benefit of spawn-target pair selections. Using this framework we propose a spawn-target pair selection algorithm for prescient instruction prefetch. This algorithm has been implemented, and evaluated for the Itanium Processor Family architecture. A limit study finds 4.8% to 17% speedups on an in-order simultaneous multithreading processor with eight contexts, over nextline and streaming I-prefetch for a set of benchmarks with high I-cache miss rates. The framework in this paper is potentially applicable to other thread speculation techniques. Copyright 2003 ACM. .

## Analyzing the Sentiment Towards Itanium

This article focuses on **optimizing instruction prefetch** for single-threaded applications. It introduces a novel technique called "prescient instruction prefetch" that uses helper threads to proactively fetch instructions, aiming to reduce I-cache misses and improve performance. 

The article outlines a framework for modeling program behavior using Markov chains, which allows them to analyze and optimize the selection of "spawn-target pairs" – points in the code where the helper thread starts prefetching. This framework is then used to develop an algorithm for selecting these pairs.

**The article's primary focus is on the optimization technique and framework, not on evaluating the Itanium architecture itself.** The Itanium Processor Family is only mentioned as the target architecture for the implementation and evaluation of their algorithm. While the article notes speedups of 4.8% to 17% on an Itanium processor, these results are presented in the context of comparing their technique to existing prefetching methods (nextline and streaming I-prefetch). **There is no explicit positive or negative sentiment expressed towards Itanium.**

**Therefore, the article's sentiment towards Itanium is neutral.**

**[0] - Neutral**

2003-01-01 - A region-based compilation infrastructure

Article:
The traditional framework for back-end compilation is based on the scope of functions, which is a natural boundary to partition an entire program for compilation. However, the sizes and structures of functions may not be the best scope for program analyses and transformations when considering compilation resources (e.g. time and space), performance, and functionality. This problem is particularly pronounced when modern compiler optimizations resort to sophisticated and expensive algorithms to aim at high performance computing. Furthermore, it is often beneficial to give priority to optimize the more profitable portions of programs. Earlier works have proposed ways to allow some control on the size and structure of optimization scope. In this paper we develop a new region-based compilation framework driven by the considerations of performance opportunities and compilation resources. In addition, we allow some optimization-directed attributes communicated from one optimization phase to another on a region basis to guide subsequent optimizations. This region-based framework has been implemented in the Open Research Compiler targeting Itanium Processor Family (IPF). Experimental results from the SPEC2000Int programs show that this infrastructure provides an effective control on forming regions to meet the requirements of different optimizations. For example, the compilation time of instruction scheduling is significantly reduced by this region formation infrastructure while preserving or improving the overall performance. At the highest optimization level, the performance of one program has a 15.6% improvement by employing this region-based infrastructure.  2003 IEEE. .

## Analyzing the Sentiment of the Article Towards Itanium

The article focuses on developing a new **region-based compilation framework** to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of compiler optimizations, particularly for high-performance computing. The central argument is that traditional function-based compilation scopes are often inadequate for modern optimization algorithms, leading to inefficiencies and missed performance opportunities.

The authors propose a solution by **partitioning the program into regions** that are more suitable for optimization. These regions are determined based on factors like potential performance gains and available compilation resources. This approach allows for more granular control over optimization efforts, enabling the compiler to focus on the most profitable parts of the code.

While Itanium is mentioned specifically as the target architecture for the implementation of this region-based framework, the article does not directly focus on the strengths or weaknesses of Itanium itself. The focus remains on the **general principles and benefits of the new compilation approach**. Itanium is simply the platform chosen for demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

**The article highlights the positive outcomes of this approach on Itanium:**

* **Reduced compilation time for instruction scheduling:** This demonstrates a significant efficiency gain achieved through the region-based approach.
* **Improved performance for one program:**  A 15.6% performance improvement achieved by using the new framework.

**However, there is no explicit criticism of Itanium itself.** The article simply presents the new compilation approach as a solution to a general problem in optimizing programs, particularly those targeting high-performance computing.

**Conclusion:**

The article is primarily focused on the benefits of the new region-based compilation framework. Itanium serves as the target platform for this implementation, but the focus is not on praising or criticizing the architecture itself. The authors demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by highlighting its positive impact on compilation efficiency and performance.

2003-01-01 - A statistical adaptive block-matching motion estimation

Article:
In this paper, we address the problem of motion estimation (ME) in digital video sequences and propose a new fast, adaptive, and efficient block-matching algorithm. Higher quality and efficiency are achieved using a statistical model for the motion vectors. This model introduces adaptation in the search window, drastically reducing the number of positions where correlation-type computation is performed. The efficiency is further improved by progressively undersampling the macroblock. Patterns for undersampling are proposed to obtain the maximum benefit from single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions. In contrast with existing motion-estimation techniques, search strategy and subsampled patterns are closely linked. This shows that a good search strategy is much more important than blindly reducing the number of pixels considered for the matching pattern. We describe an implementation of the proposed matching strategy that exploits the very long instruction word (VLIW) and SIMD technology available in the new Itanium Processor Family. Results show that the proposed algorithm adapts easily to the evolution of the scene avoiding annoying quality drops that can be observed with other deterministic algorithms. The total number of operations required by the proposed method is inferior to those required by traditional approaches. .

Article:
We present a non-operational approach to specifying and analyzing shared memory consistency models. The method uses higher order logic to capture a complete set of ordering constraints on execution traces, in an axiomatic style. A direct encoding of the semantics with a constraint logic programming language provides an interactive and incremental framework for exercising and verifying finite test programs. The framework has also been adapted to generate equivalent boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. These techniques make a memory model specification executable, a powerful feature lacked in most non-operational methods. As an example, we provide a concise formalization of the Intel Itanium memory model and show how constraint solving and SAT solving can be effectively applied for computer aided analysis. Encouraging initial results demonstrate the scalability for complex industrial designs.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003. .

2003-01-01 - Compiler optimization-space exploration

Article:
To meet the demands of modern architectures, optimizing compilers must incorporate an ever larger number of increasingly complex transformation algorithms. Since code transformations may often degrade performance or interfere with subsequent transformations, compilers employ predictive heuristics to guide optimizations by predicting their effects a priori. Unfortunately, the unpredictability of optimization interaction and the irregularity of today's wide-issue machines severely limit the accuracy of these heuristics. As a result, compiler writers may temper high variance optimizations with overly conservative heuristics or may exclude these optimizations entirely. While this process results in a compiler capable of generating good average code quality across the target benchmark set, it is at the cost of missed optimization opportunities in individual code segments. To replace predictive heuristics, researchers have proposed compilers which explore many optimization options, selecting the best one a posteriori. Unfortunately, these existing iterative compilation techniques are not practical for reasons of compile time and applicability. We present the Optimization-Space Exploration (OSE) compiler organization, the first practical iterative compilation strategy applicable to optimizations in general-purpose compilers. Instead of replacing predictive heuristics, OSE uses the compiler writer's knowledge encoded in the heuristics to select a small number of promising optimization alternatives for a given code segment. Compile time is limited by evaluating only these alternatives for hot code segments using a general compile-time performance estimator An OSE-enhanced version of Intel's highly-tuned, aggressively optimizing production compiler for IA-64 yields a significant performance improvement, more than 20% in some cases, on Itanium for SPEC codes.  2003 IEEE. .

In this article, we present a novel linear time algorithm for data remapping, that is, (i) lightweight; (ii) fully automated; and (iii) applicable in the context of pointer-centric programming languages with dynamic memory allocation support. All previous work in this area lacks one or more of these features.We proceed to demonstrate a novel application of this algorithm as a key step in optimizing the design of an embedded memory system. Specifically, we show that by virtue of locality enhancements via data remapping, we may reduce the memory subsystem needs of an application by 50%, and hence concomitantly reduce the associated costs in terms of size, power, and dollar-investment (61%). Such a reduction overcomes key hurdles in designing high-performance embedded computing solutions. Namely, memory subsystems are very desirable from a performance standpoint, but their costs have often limited their use in embedded systems. Thus, our innovative approach offers the intriguing possibility of compilers playing a significant role in exploring and optimizing the design space of a memory subsystem for an embedded design. To this end and in order to properly leverage the improvements afforded by a compiler optimization, we identify a range of measures for quantifying the cost-impact of popular notions of locality, prefetching, regularity of memory access, and others. The proposed methodology will become increasingly important, especially as the needs for application specific embedded architectures become prevalent. In addition, we demonstrate the wide applicability of data remapping using several existing microprocessors, such as the Pentium and UltraSparc. Namely, we show that remapping can achieve a performance improvement of 20% on the average. Similarly, for a parametric research HPL-PD microprocessor, which characterizes the new Itanium machines, we achieve a performance improvement of 28% on average. All of our results are achieved using applications from the DIS, Olden and SPEC2000 suites of integer and floating point benchmarks. Copyright  2003, ACM. All rights reserved. . Keywords:;

2003-01-01 - Efficient resource management during instruction scheduling for the EPIC architectures

Article:
Effective and efficient modelling and management of hardware resources have always been critical toward generating highly efficient code in optimizing compilers. The instruction templates and dispersal rules of the EPIC architecture add new complexity in managing resource constraints to instruction scheduler. We extended a finite state automaton (FSA) approach to efficiently manage all key resource constraints of an EPIC architecture on-the-fly during instruction scheduling. We have fully integrated the FSA-based resource management into the instruction scheduler in the Open Research Compiler for the EPIC architecture. Our integrated approach shows up to 12% speedup on some SPECint2000 benchmarks and 4.5% speedup on average for all SPECint2000 benchmarks on an Itanium machine when compares to an instruction scheduler with decoupled resource management. In the meantime, the instruction scheduling time of our approach is reduced by 4% on average.  2003 IEEE. .

2003-01-01 - Eliminating exception constraints of java programs for IA-64

Article:
Java exception checks are designed to ensure that any faulting instruction causing a hardware exception does not terminate the program abnormally. These checks, however, impose some constraints upon the execution order between an instruction potentially raising a Java exception and a faulting instruction causing a hardware exception. This reduces the effectiveness of instruction reordering optimizations for Java programs. Although some effective techniques have been proposed to eliminate exception checks, many exception checks still remain. We propose a new framework to perform speculation effectively for Java programs using a direct acyclic graph representation (DAG) based on the SSA form. Using this framework, we apply a well-known speculation technique to a faulting load instruction to eliminate such constraints. We use edges to represent exception constraints. This allows us to estimate the potential reduction of the critical path length accurately for applying speculation. The new framework also allows us to avoid extra copy instructions and to generate efficient code with minimum register pressure. We have implemented it in the IBM Java Just-In-Time compiler, and observed performance improvements of 30% for one of the micro-benchmark programs, up to 13% (with an average of 1.7%) for the Java Grande Benchmark Suite, and up to 12% (with an average of 1.2%) for SPECjvm98 on an Itanium processor. Our speculation technique was particularly effective for those programs that access multidimensional arrays. .

Article:
We present a new integrated prepass scheduling (IPS) algorithm for a Java just-in-time (JIT) compiler which integrates register minimization into list scheduling. We use backtracking in the list scheduling when we have used up all the available registers. To reduce the overhead of backtracking, we incrementally maintain a set of candidate instructions for undoing scheduling. To maximize the ILP after undoing scheduling, we select an instruction chain with the smallest increase in the total execution time. We implemented our new algorithm in a production-level Java JIT compiler for the Intel Itanium processor. The experiment showed that, compared to the best known algorithm by Govindarajan et al., our IPS algorithm improved the performance by up to +1.8% while it reduced the compilation time for IPS by 58% on average.  2003 IEEE. .

2003-01-01 - Intel Itanium floating-point architecture

Article:
The Intel Itanium architecture is increasingly becoming one of the major processor architectures present in the market today. Launched in 2001, the Intel Itanium processor was followed in 2002 by the Itanium 2 processor, with increased integer and floating-point performance. Measured by the SPEC CINT2000 benchmarks, the Itanium 2 processor still trails by about 25% the Intel P4 processor in integer performance, albeit P4 runs at more than three times Itanium's clock frequency. However, its floating-point performance clearly leads in the SPEC CFP2000 charts, and its rating is about 25% higher than that of the P4 processor. While the general features of the Itanium architecture such as large register sets, predication, speculation, and support for explicit parallelism 1 have been presented in several papers, books, and mainstream college textbooks 2, its floating-point architecture has been less publicized. Two books, 3 and 4, cover well this area.

2003-01-01 - Inter-Procedural Stacked Register Allocation for Itanium Like Architecture

Article:
A hardware managed register stack, Register Stack Engine (RSE), is implemented in Itanium architecture to provide a unified and flexible register structure to software. The compiler allocates each procedure a register stack frame with its size explicitly specified using an alloc instruction. When the total number of registers used by the procedures on the call stack exceeds the number of physical registers, RSE performs automatically register overflows and fills to ensure that the current procedure has its requested registers available. The virtual register stack frames and RSE alleviate the need of explicit spills by the compiler, but our experimental results indicate that a trade-off exists between using stacked registers and explicit spills under high register pressure due to the uneven cost between them. In this work, we introduce the stacked register quota assignment problem based on the observation that reducing stacked register usage in some procedures could reduce the total memory access time of spilling registers, which includes the time caused by the loads/stores due to explicit register spills and RSE overflows/fills. We propose a new inter-procedural algorithm to solve the problem by allocating stacked registers across procedures based on a quantitative cost model. The results show that our approach can improve performance significantly for the programs with high RSE overflow cost, e.g. perlbmk and crafty, improved by 14% and 3.7%, respectively. .

2003-01-01 - Optimization for the Intel Itanium architecture register stack

Article:
The Intel Itanium architecture contains a number of innovative compiler-controllable features designed to exploit instruction level parallelism. New code generation and optimization techniques are critical to the application of these features to improve processor performance. For instance, the Itanium architecture provides a compiler-controllable virtual register stack to reduce the penalty of memory accesses associated with procedure calls. The Itanium Register Stack Engine (RSE) transparently manages the register stack and saves and restores physical registers to and from memory as needed. Existing code generation techniques for the register stack aggressively allocate virtual registers without regard to the register pressure on different control-flow paths. As such, applications with large data sets may stress the RSE, and cause substantial execution delays due to the high number of register saves and restores. Since the Itanium architecture is developed around Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) concepts, solutions to increasing the register stack efficiency favor code generation techniques rather than hardware approaches.  2003 IEEE. .

2003-01-01 - Performance potentials of compiler-directed data speculation

Article:
Compiler-directed data speculation has been implemented on Itanium systems to allow for a compiler to move a load across a store even when the two operations are potentially aliased This not only breaks data dependency to reduce critical path length, but also allows a load to be scheduled far apart from its uses to hide cache miss latencies. However, the effectiveness of data speculation is affected by the sophistication of alias analysis technique as well as the aggressiveness of the instruction scheduler. In general, the more sophisticated is the alias analysis technique, the less performance gain is from data speculation, and the more aggressive is the instruction scheduler, the more opportunity is for data speculation. In this paper we evaluate in various scenarios the performance potentials of data speculation for SPEC2000C benchmarks. For each scenario, we determine the performance contributions of data speculation due to both critical path reduction and cache miss latency reduction. We also show interesting statistics about the effects of scheduling constraints, the percentage of critical dependencies, the impacts of cache miss latencies, and the distances between the load locations before and after data speculation.  2003 IEEE. .

2003-01-01 - Procedure cloning and integration for converting parallelism from coarse to fine grain

Article:
This paper introduces a method for improving program run-time performance by gathering work in an application and executing it efficiently in an integrated thread. Our methods extend whole-program optimization by expanding the scope of the compiler through a combination of software thread integration and procedure cloning. In each experiment we integrate a frequently executed procedure with itself twice or thrice, creating two clones. Then, based on profile data we select at compile time the fastest version (original or clone) and modify call sites as needed. We demonstrate our technique by cloning and integrating three procedures from cjpeg and djpeg at the C source code level, compiling with four compilers for the Itanium EPIC architecture and measuring the performance with the on-chip performance measurement units. For cjpeg, which is not significantly constrained by the i-cache, we find integration consistently improves code generated by all compilers but one, with a mean program speedup of 11.99%.  2003 IEEE. .

2003-01-01 - Region-based compilation framework

Article:
The traditional framework for back-end compilation is based on the scope of functions, which is a convenient way to partition an entire application program. However, the sizes and structures of functions may not be the best scope for program analysis and transformations when considering compilation resources (such as time and memory usage), performance, and functionality. This problem is particularly critical when the modern compilers resort to sophisticated and expensive algorithms to exploit instruction-level parallelism. When a function has a large size, an expensive algorithm based on the function scope often makes the usage of compilation time and space usage unacceptable. Some earlier work proposed a compilation framework to allow some control on the size and structure of an optimization scope. This paper proposes a new region-based compilation framework driven by the considerations of compilation resources and performance opportunities. And some optimization-directed attributes can be passed and observed from optimization phase to phase on a region basis. This region-based framework is being implemented in a compiler ORC (Open Research Compiler) targeting at the Itanium Processor Family (IPF). .

2003-01-01 - The fallacy of spec-based design

Article:
The architectural reference model, a critical tool in microprocessor validation, serves as a gold standard against which a microprocessor is compared. As all validation is performed using it, the reference model must be timely, extensible beyond the original specification, customizable for specific usage models, and, most importantly, functionally flawless. Ideally, we would like a specification-based design flow that transforms the published English language specifications into compilable code that is directly incorporated into the reference model without loss of information or accuracy. At Intel, we have developed and implemented such a flow to create the Itanium&#174; Processor Family&#39;s (IPF) reference model, which is used to validate all IPF processors. In this paper, we describe the benefits and limitations of this process and discuss the practical implications of specification-based design.  2003 IEEE. .

2003-01-01 - The performance of runtime data cache prefetching in a dynamic optimization system

Article:
Traditional software controlled data cache prefetching is often ineffective due to the lack of runtime cache miss and miss address information. To overcome this limitation, we implement runtime data cache prefetching in the dynamic optimization system ADORE (ADaptive Object code Reoptimization). Its performance has been compared with static software prefetching on the SPEC2000 benchmark suite. Runtime cache prefetching shows better performance. On an Itanium 2 based Linux workstation, it can increase performance by more than 20% over static prefetching on some benchmarks. For benchmarks that do not benefit from prefetching, the runtime optimization system adds only 1%-2% overhead. We have also collected cache miss profiles to guide static data cache prefetching in the ORC compiler. With that information the compiler can effectively avoid generating prefetches for loops that hit well in the data cache.  2003 IEEE. .

2003-01-01 - Unspeculation

Article:
Modern architectures, such as the Intel Itanium, support speculation, a hardware mechanism that allows the early execution of expensive operations-possibly even before it is known whether the results of the operation are needed. While such speculative execution can improve execution performance considerably, it requires a significant amount of complex support code to deal with and recover from speculation failures. This greatly complicates the tasks of understanding and re-engineering speculative code. This paper describes a technique for removing speculative instructions from optimized binary programs in a way that is guaranteed to preserve program semantics, thereby making the resulting unspeculated programs easier to understand and more amenable to re-engineering using traditional reverse engineering techniques.  2003 IEEE .

2004-01-01 - A compiler framework for recovery code generation in general speculative optimizations

Article:
A general framework that integrates both control and data speculation using alias profiling and/or compiler heuristic rules has shown to improve SPEC2000 performance on Itanium systems. However, speculative optimizations require check instructions and recovery code to ensure correct execution when speculation fails at runtime. How to generate check instructions and their associated recovery code efficiently and effectively is an issue yet to be well studied. Also, it is very important that the recovery code generated in the earlier phases integrate gracefully in the later optimization phases. At the very least, it should not hinder later optimizations, thus, ensuring overall performance improvement. This paper proposes a framework that uses an if-block structure to facilitate check instructions and recovery code generation for general speculative optimizations. It allows speculative instructions and their recovery code generated in the early compiler optimization phases to be integrated effectively with the subsequent optimization phases. It also allows multi-level speculation for multi-level pointers and multi-level expression trees to be handled with no additional complexity. The proposed recovery code generation framework has been implemented in the Open Research Compiler (ORC). .

2004-01-01 - A multi-platform Co-array Fortran compiler

Article:
Co-array Fortran (CAF) - a small set of extensions to Fortran 90 - is an emerging model for scalable, global address space parallel programming. CAF's global address space programming model simplifies the development of single-program-multiple-data parallel programs by shifting the burden for managing the details of communication from developers to compilers. This paper describes cafe - a prototype implementation of an open-source, multiplatform CAF compiler that generates code well-suited for today's commodity clusters. The cafc compiler translates CAF into Fortran 90 plus calls to one-sided communication primitives.

2004-01-01 - A real time MPEG-4 parallel encoder on software distributed shared memory systems

Article:
This paper is dedicated to developing a real-time MEPG-4 parallel encoder on software distributed shared memory systems. Basically, the performance of a MPEG-4 parallel encoder implemented on distributed systems is mainly determined by the latency of data synchronization and disk I/O, and the cost of data computation. For reducing the impact of data synchronization latency, we invent a pipeline algorithm to minimize the number of data synchronization points necessary for video encoding. In addition, we employ a master-slave node structure to overlay computation and I/O in order for alleviating the impact of I/O latency. On the other hand, we propose a two-level partitioning method to minimize the cost of data computation, and overlap the encoding times of two different GOVs. We have implemented the proposed MPEG-4 encoder on a test bed called Teamster. The experimental results show the proposed MPEG-4 encoder has successfully met the requirement of real time through the support of previous techniques via 32 SMP machines, which are equipped with dual 1.5 GHz Itanium II processors per node and connected by Gigabit Ethernet.

2004-01-01 - An empirical performance analysis of commodity memories in commodity servers

Article:
This work details a performance study of six different types of commodity memories in two commodity server nodes. A number of micro-benchmarks are used that measure low-level performance characteristics, as well as two applications representative of the ASC workload. The memories vary both in terms of performance, including latency and bandwidths, and in terms of their physical properties and manufacturer. The two server nodes analyzed were an Itanium-II Madison based system, and a Xeon based system. All memories can be used within both of these processing nodes. This allows the performance of the memories to be directly examined while keeping all other factors within a node the same (processor, motherboard, operating system etc.). The results of this study show that there can be a significant difference in application performance depending on the actual memory used - by as much as 20%. The achieved performance is a result of the integration of the memory into the node as well as how the applications actually utilize it. Copyright 2004 ACM. .

2004-01-01 - Applications of storage mapping optimization to register promotion

Article:
Storage mapping optimization is a flexible approach to folding array dimensions in numerical codes. It is designed to reduce the memory footprint after a wide spectrum of loop transformations, whether based on uniform dependence vectors or more expressive polyhedral abstractions. Conversely, few loop transformations have been proposed to facilitate register promotion, namely loop fusion, unroll-and-jam or tiling. Building on array data-flow analysis and expansion, we extend storage mapping optimization to improve opportunities for register promotion. Our work is motivated by the empirical study of a computational biology benchmark, the approximate string matching algorithm BPR from NR-grep, on a wide issue micro-architecture. Our experiments confirm the major benefit of register tiling (even on non-numerical benchmarks) but also shed the light on two novel issues: prior array expansion may be necessary to enable loop transformations that finally authorize profitable register promotion, and more advanced scheduling techniques (beyond tiling and unrolland-jam) may significantly improve performance in fine-tuning register usage and instruction-level parallelism. .

2004-01-01 - Applying MPI derived datatypes to the NAS benchmarks: A case study

Article:
MPI derived datatypes are a powerful method to define arbitrary collections of non-contiguous data in memory and to enable non-contiguous data communication in a single MPI function call. In this paper, we employ MPI datatypes in four NAS benchmarks (MG, LU, BT, and SP) to transfer non-contiguous data. Comprehensive performance evaluation was carried out on two clusters: an Itanium-2 Myrinet cluster and a Xeon InfiniBand cluster. Performance results show that using datatypes can achieve performance comparable to manual packing/unpacking in the original benchmarks, though the MPI implementations that were studied also perform internal packing and unpacking on non-contiguous datatype communication. In some cases, better performance can be achieved because of the reduced costs to transfer non-contiguous data. This is because some optimizations in the MPI packing/unpacking implementations can be easily overlooked in manual packing and unpacking by users. Our case study demonstrates that MPI datatypes simplify the implementation of non-contiguous communication and lead to application code with portable performance. We expect that with further improvement of datatype processing and datatype communication such as, datatypes can outperform the conventional methods of noncontiguous data communication. Our modified NAS benchmarks can be used to evaluate datatype processing and datatype communication in MPI implementations. .

Article:
Co-array Fortran (CAF) is an emerging model for scalable, global address space parallel programming that consists of a small set of extensions to the Fortran 90 programming language. Compared to MPI, the widely-used message-passing programming model, CAF's global address space programming model simplifies the development of single-program-multiple-data parallel programs by shifting the burden for choreographing and optimizing communication from developers to compilers. This paper describes an open-source, portable, and retargetable CAP compiler under development at Rice University that is well-suited for today's high-performance clusters. Our compiler translates CAF into Fortran 90 plus calls to one-sided communication primitives. Preliminary experiments comparing CAF and MPI versions of several of the NAS parallel benchmarks on an Itanium 2 cluster with a Myrinet 2000 interconnect show that our CAF compiler delivers performance that is roughly equal to or, in many cases, better than that of programs parallelized using MPI, even though support for global optimization of communication has not yet been implemented in our compiler.

2004-01-01 - Compiler orchestrated prefetching via speculation and predication

Article:
This paper introduces a compiler-orchestrated prefetching system as a unified framework geared toward ameliorating the gap between processing speeds and memory access latencies. We focus the scope of the optimization on specific subsets of the program dependence graph that succinctly characterize the memory access pattern of both regular array-based applications and irregular pointer-intensive programs. We illustrate how program embedded precomputation via speculative execution can accurately predict and effectively prefetch future memory references with negligible overhead. The proposed techniques reduce the total running time of seven SPEC benchmarks and two OLDEN benchmarks by 27% on an Itanium 2 processor. The improvements are in addition to several state-of-the-art optimizations including software pipelining and data prefetching. In addition, we use cycle-accurate simulations to identify important and lightweight architectural innovations that further mitigate the memory system bottleneck. In particular, we focus on the notoriously challenging class of pointer-chasing applications, and demonstrate how they may benefit from a novel scheme of sentineled prefetching. Our results for twelve SPEC benchmarks demonstrate that 45% of the processor stalls that are caused by the memory system are avoidable. The techniques in this paper can effectively mask long memory latencies with little instruction overhead, and can readily contribute to the performance of processors today. Copyright 2004 ACM. .

2004-01-01 - Compiler-assisted cache replacement: Problem formulation and performance evaluation

Article:
Recent research results show that conventional hardware-only cache solutions result in unsatisfactory cache utilization for both regular and irregular applications. To overcome this problem, a number of architectures introduce instruction hints to assist cache replacement. For example, Intel Itanium architecture augments memory accessing instructions with cache hints to distinguish data that will be referenced in the near future from the rest. With the availability of such methods, the performance of the underlying cache architecture critically depends on the ability of the compiler to generate code with appropriate cache hints. In this paper we formulate this problem - giving cache hints to memory instructions such that cache miss rate is minimized - as a 0/1 knapsack problem, which can be efficiently solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. The proposed approach has been implemented in our compiler testbed and evaluated on a set of scientific computing benchmarks. Initial results show that our approach is effective on reducing the cache miss rate and improving program performance.  Springer-Verlag; 2004. .

2004-01-01 - Construction and performance characterization of parallel interior point solver on 4-way intel Itanium 2 multiprocessor system

Article:
In recent years the interior point method (IPM) has became a dominant choice for solving large convex optimization problems for many scientific, engineering and commercial applications. Two reasons for the success of the IPM are its good scalability on existing multiprocessor systems with a small number of processors and its potential to deliver a scalable performance on systems with a large number of processors. The scalability of a parallel IPM is determined by several key issues such as exploiting parallelism due to sparsity of the problem, reducing communication overhead and proper load balancing. In this paper we present an implementation of a parallel linear programming IPM workload and characterize its scalability on a 4-way Itanium 2 system. We show a speedup of up to 3-times for some of the datasets. We also present a detailed micro-architectural analysis of the workload using VTune  performance analyzer. Our results suggest that a good IPM implementation is latency-bound. Based on these findings, we make suggestions on how to improve the performance of the IPM workload in the future.  2004 IEEE. .

Processor speed continues to increase faster than the speed of access to main memory, making effective use of memory caches more important.

2004-01-01 - Data dependence profiling for speculative optimizations

Article:
Data dependence analysis is the foundation to many reordering related compiler optimizations and loop parallelization. Traditional data dependence analysis algorithms are developed primarily for Fortran-like subscripted array variables. They are not very effective for pointer-based references in C or C++. With more advanced hardware support for speculative execution, such as the advanced load instructions in Intel's IA64 architecture, some data dependences with low probability can be speculatively ignored. However, such speculative optimizations must be carefully applied to avoid excessive cost associated with potential mis-speculations. Data dependence profiling is one way to provide probabilistic information on data dependences to guide such speculative optimizations and speculative thread generation. Software-based data dependence profiling requires detailed tracing of memory accesses, therefore, could be very time consuming. In this paper, we examine issues related to data dependence profiling, and propose various techniques to improve the efficiency of data dependence profiling. We use the Open Research Compiler (ORC) [15,16] to test the efficiency of our data profiling techniques. We also study the effectiveness of data dependence profiling on data speculative optimizations on Itanium systems. Our results show that efficient data dependence profiling could improve the performance for data speculative optimizations.  Springer-Verlag 2004. .

2004-01-01 - Digital tomosynthesis mammography using a parallel maximum likelihood reconstruction method

Article:
A parallel reconstruction method, based on an iterative maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm, is developed to provide fast reconstruction for digital tomosynthesis mammography. Tomosynthesis mammography acquires 11 low-dose projections of a breast by moving an x-ray tube over a 50 angular range. In parallel reconstruction, each projection is divided into multiple segments along the chest-to-nipple direction. Using the 11 projections, segments located at the same distance from the chest wall are combined to compute a partial reconstruction of the total breast volume. The shape of the partial reconstruction forms a thin slab, angled toward the x-ray source at a projection angle 0. The reconstruction of the total breast volume is obtained by merging the partial reconstructions. The overlap region between neighboring partial reconstructions and neighboring projection segments is utilized to compensate for the incomplete data at the boundary locations present in the partial reconstructions. A serial execution of the reconstruction is compared to a parallel implementation, using clinical data. The serial code was run on a PC with a single PentiumIV 2.2GHz CPU. The parallel implementation was developed using MPI and run on a 64-node Linux cluster using 800MHz Itanium CPUs. The serial reconstruction for a medium-sized breast (5cm thickness, 11cm chest-to-nipple distance) takes 115 minutes, while a parallel implementation takes only 3.5 minutes. The reconstruction time for a larger breast using a serial implementation takes 187 minutes, while a parallel implementation takes 6.5 minutes. No significant differences were observed between the reconstructions produced by the serial and parallel implementations. .

Article:
Since December 2002 the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has been evaluating an Altix 3000, the newest high performance computing system available from Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI). The Altix is a departure from the previous products from SGI in that instead of using MIPS processors and the IRIX operating system, the Altix uses the Intel Itanium IA-64 processor and SGI ProPack (based on Linux Red Hat) operating system. The Altix still has the brick concept of system configuration and the SGI NUMAlink for the inter-module network for the shared memory.

## Analyzing the Sentiment towards Itanium

The article primarily focuses on **introducing and evaluating the SGI Altix 3000 supercomputer**, highlighting its key features and comparing it to previous SGI products. The Altix 3000 utilizes the Intel Itanium IA-64 processor, which is a significant departure from SGI's traditional MIPS architecture. 

While the article doesn't explicitly state its opinion on the Itanium processor, it does emphasize the **change** it represents within SGI's product line:

* **"The Altix is a departure from the previous products from SGI... the Altix uses the Intel Itanium IA-64 processor..."** This statement highlights the shift from MIPS to Itanium as a key differentiator.
* **"Various codes have been evaluated with respect to their ease of portability and their performance on the Altix..."** This indicates the article's primary concern is with the overall performance and usability of the Altix 3000, with Itanium being a crucial component within this context.

However, the article also notes the Altix 3000 runs under a **"single image of the operating system"** and **"supports parallel programming through OpenMP, MPI, CoArray, FORTRAN, and an automatic parallelizing compiler,"** indicating a focus on **efficiency and ease of use** within the Altix 3000 system. This might imply that the choice of Itanium was driven by these practical concerns rather than a specific focus on the processor itself.

**Overall, the article focuses more on the Altix 3000 as a whole, rather than specifically praising or criticizing the Itanium processor.** While Itanium's presence is acknowledged, the article's primary concern is with the overall performance and usability of the system, making it **difficult to discern a strong positive or negative sentiment towards the Itanium processor itself.**

**Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium in this article is: [0] - Neutral.**

Article:
Knowledge of data values at run-time allows us to generate better code in terms of eficiency, size and power consumption. This paper introduces a low-level compiling technique based on a minimal code generator with parametric embedded sections to generate binary code at run-time. This generator called a "compilet" creates code and allocates registers using the data input. Then, it generates the needed instructions. Our measurements, performed on Itanium 2 and PowerPC platforms have shown a speed improvement of 43% on the Itanium 2 platform and 41% on the PowerPC one. The proposed technique proves to be particularly useful in the case of intensively reused functions in graphic applications, where the advantages of dynamic compilation have not been fully taken into account yet. .

Presented is a method for formal verification of pipelined processors with long instruction queues. The execution engine and the fetch engine (where the instruction queue is) are formally verified separately, after abstracting the other engine with a non-deterministic FSM derived from the high-level specification of that engine. Without the presented method, the monolithic formal verification of 9-stage, 9-wide VLIW processors - implementing many realistic and speculative features inspired by the Intel Itanium-scaled for models with 5 instruction-queue entries, but ran out of memory if the instruction queue was longer.

This method is crucial for tackling the complexity of verifying such systems, as traditional monolithic verification approaches struggle with large instruction queues. 

The article specifically mentions that the presented method was tested on **9-stage, 9-wide VLIW processors**, inspired by **Intel Itanium**. This suggests that Itanium's architecture was a source of inspiration for the research.

However, the article highlights a critical issue with Itanium: the traditional verification method struggled to handle processors with even **5 instruction queue entries**, running out of memory.  The authors then emphasize that their method, in contrast, **achieves a 2-order of magnitude speedup** for 5-entry queues and **enables scaling for designs with 64-entry queues**. 

While the article doesn't directly criticize Itanium, it implicitly suggests that **Itanium's architecture posed a challenge for traditional formal verification**. The fact that the new method addresses this challenge and allows for significantly larger instruction queues is presented as a positive outcome. This implies that the authors see their work as potentially **improving upon limitations associated with Itanium's architecture.** 

**Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium can be categorized as:**

**[-1] - Signs of critique (Sceptical of Itanium, or indirectly negative)**

2004-01-01 - Efficient modeling of Itanium architecture during instruction scheduling using extended finite state automata

Article:
Effective and efficient modeling and management of hardware resources have always been critical toward generating highly efficient code in optimizing compilers. The instruction templates and dispersal rules of the Itanium architecture add new complexity in managing resource constraints to instruction scheduler. We extended a finite state automaton (FSA) approach to efficiently manage all key resource constraints of an Itanium architecture on-the-fly during instruction scheduling. We have fully integrated the FSA-based resource management into the instruction scheduler in the Open Research Compiler for the Itanium architecture. Our integrated approach shows up to 12% speedup on some SPECint2000 benchmarks and 4.5% speedup on average for all SPECint2000 benchmarks on an Itanium-based system when compares to an instruction scheduler with decoupled resource management. In the meantime, the instruction scheduling time of our approach is reduced by 4% on average. .

2004-01-01 - Exploiting free execution slots on EPIC processors for efficient and accurate runtime profiling

Article:
Dynamic optimization relies on runtime profile information to improve the performance of program execution. Traditional profiling techniques incur significant overhead and are not suitable for dynamic optimization. In this paper, we propose a new profiling technique that incorporates the strength of both software and hardware to achieve near-zero overhead profiling. The compiler passes profiling requests as a few bits of information in branch instructions to the hardware, and the hardware uses the free execution slots available in a user program to execute profiling operations. We have implemented the compiler instrumentation of this technique using an Itanium research compiler. Our result shows that the accurate block profiling incurs very little overhead to the user program in terms of the program scheduling cycles. For example, the average overhead is 0.6% for the SPECint95 benchmarks. The hardware support required for the new profiling is practical. We believe this will enable many profile-driven dynamic optimizations for EPIC processors such as the Itanium processors.  Springer-Verlag 2004. .

2004-01-01 - Exploring the performance potential of itanium processors with ILP-based scheduling

Article:
HP and Intel's Itanium Processor Family (IPF) is considered as one of the most challenging processor architectures to generate code for. During global instruction scheduling, the compiler must balance the use of strongly interdependent techniques like code motion, speculation and predication. A too conservative application of these features can lead to empty execution slots, contrary to the EPIC philosophy. But overuse can cause resource shortage which spoils the benefit. We tackle this problem using integer linear programming (ILP), a proven standard optimization method. Our ILP model comprises global, partial-ready code motion with automated generation of compensation code as well as vital IPF features like control / data speculation and predication. The ILP approach can - with some restrictions - resolve the interdependences between these decisions and deliver the global optimum. This promises a speedup for compute-intensive applications as well as some theoretically funded insights into the potential of the architecture. Experiments with several hot functions from the SPEC benchmarks show substantial improvements: Our postpass optimizer reduces the schedule lengths produced by Intel's compiler by about 20-40%. The resulting speedup of these routines is 16% on average. .

2004-01-01 - Field-testing IMPACT EPIC research results in Itanium 2

Article:
Explicitly-Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) provides architectural features, including predication and explicit control speculation, intended to enhance the compiler's ability to expose instruction-level parallelism (ILP) in control-intensive programs. Aggressive structural transformations using these features, though described in the literature, have not yet been fully characterized in complete systems. Using the Intel Itanium 2 microprocessor, the SPECint2000 benchmarks and the IMPACT Compiler for IA-64, a research compiler competitive with the best commercial compilers on the platform, we provide an in situ evaluation of code generated using aggressive, EPIC-enabled techniques in a reality-constrained microarchitecture. Our work shows a 1.13 average speedup (up to 1.50) due to these compilation techniques, relative to traditionally-optimized code at the same inlining and pointer analysis levels, and a 1.55 speedup (up to 2.30) relative to GNU GCC, a solid traditional compiler. Detailed results show that the structural compilation approach provides benefits far beyond a decrease in branch misprediction penalties and that it both positively and negatively impacts instruction cache performance. We also demonstrate the increasing significance of runtime effects, such as data cache and TLB, in determining end performance and the interaction of these effects with control speculation. .

2004-01-01 - Hardware support for prescient instruction prefetch

Article:
This paper proposes and evaluates hardware mechanisms for supporting prescient instruction prefetch - an approach to improving single-threaded application performance by using helper threads to perform instruction prefetch. We demonstrate the need for enabling store-to-load communication and selective instruction execution when directly pre-executing future regions of an application that suffer I-cache misses. Two novel hardware mechanisms, safe-store and YAT-bits, are introduced that help satisfy these requirements. This paper also proposes and evaluates finite state machine recall, a technique for limiting pre-execution to branches that are hard to predict by leveraging a counted I-prefetch mechanism. On a research Itanium SMT processor with next line and streaming I-prefetch mechanisms that incurs latencies representative of next generation processors, prescient instruction prefetch can improve performance by an average of 10.0% to 22% on a set of SPEC 2000 benchmarks that suffer significant I-cache misses. Prescient instruction prefetch is found to be competitive against even the most aggressive research hardware instruction prefetch technique: fetch directed instruction prefetch. .

2004-01-01 - Helper threads via virtual multithreading on an experimental itanium 2 processor-based platform

Article:
Helper threading is a technology to accelerate a program by exploiting a processor's multithreading capability to run "assist" threads. Previous experiments on hyper-threaded processors have demonstrated significant speedups by using helper threads to prefetch hard-to-predict delinquent data accesses. In order to apply this technique to processors that do not have built-in hardware support for multithreading, we introduce virtual multithreading (VMT), a novel form of switch-on-event user-level multithreading, capable of fly-weight multiplexing of event-driven thread executions on a single processor without additional operating system support. The compiler plays a key role in minimizing synchronization cost by judiciously partitioning register usage among the user-level threads.

2004-01-01 - Helper threads via virtual multithreading on an experimental Itanium 2 processor-based platform

Article:
Helper threading is a technology to accelerate a program by exploiting a processor's multithreading capability to run "assist" threads. Previous experiments on hyper-threaded processors have demonstrated significant speedups by using helper threads to prefetch hard-to-predict delinquent data accesses. In order to apply this technique to processors that do not have built-in hardware support for multithreading, we introduce virtual multithreading (VMT), a novel form of switch-on-event user-level multithreading, capable of fly-weight multiplexing of event-driven thread executions on a single processor without additional operating system support. The compiler plays a key role in minimizing synchronization cost by judiciously partitioning register usage among the user-level threads. The VMT approach makes it possible to launch dynamic helper thread instances in response to long-latency cache miss events, and to run helper threads in the shadow of cache misses when the main thread would be otherwise stalled.

2004-01-01 - Improving 64-bit Java IPF performance by compressing heap references

Article:
64-bit processor architectures like the Intel Itanium Processor Family are designed for large applications that need large memory addresses. When running applications that fit within a 32-bit address space, 64-bit CPUs are at a disadvantage compared to 32-bit CPUs because of the larger memory footprints for their data. This results in worse cache and TLB utilization, and consequently lower performance because of increased miss ratios. This paper considers software techniques for virtual machines that allow 32-bit pointers to be used on 64-bit CPUs for managed runtime applications that do not need the full 64-bit address space. We describe our pointer compression techniques and discuss our experience implementing these for Java applications. In addition, we give performance results with our techniques for both the SPEC JVM98 and SPEC JBB2000 benchmarks. We demonstrate a 12% performance improvement on SPEC JBB2000 and a reduction in the number of garbage collections required for a given heap size. .

2004-01-01 - Improving load/store queues usage in scientific computing

Article:
Memory disambiguation mechanisms, coupled with load/store queues in out-of-order processors, are crucial to increase Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP), especially for memory-bound scientific codes. Designing ideal memory disambiguation mechanisms is too complex because it would require precise address bits comparators; thus, modern microprocessors implement simplified and imprecise ones that perform only partial address comparisons. In this paper, we study the impact of such simplifications on the sustained performance of some real processors such that Alpha 21264, Power 4 and Itanium 2. Despite all the advanced features of these processors, we demonstrate in this article that memory address disambiguation mechanisms can cause significant performance loss. We demonstrate that, even if data are located in low cache levels and enough ILP exist, the performance degradation can be up to 21 times slower if no care is taken on the order of accessing independent memory addresses. Instead of proposing a hardware solution to improve load/store queues, as done in [1, 6, 5, 7, 4], we show that a software (compilation) technique is possible. Such solution is based on the classical (and robust) Id/st vectorization. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of such method on BLAS 1 codes that are representative of vector scientific loops. .

## Analyzing the Sentiment Towards Itanium

This article focuses on the impact of simplified memory address disambiguation mechanisms on the performance of out-of-order processors, specifically targeting scientific computing applications. The authors argue that these simplifications, while necessary for practical implementation, can lead to significant performance degradation even with sufficient ILP and data residing in low cache levels. 

The article mentions Itanium 2 alongside Alpha 21264 and Power 4 as examples of processors affected by this issue. It does not explicitly praise or criticize Itanium 2, but rather presents it as an example of a processor that suffers from the performance issues related to memory disambiguation. 

The article's main focus is not on comparing processors, but rather on exploring the general problem of performance loss due to memory disambiguation and proposing a software solution (Id/st vectorization) to mitigate it. Itanium 2 is simply one of the processors mentioned as a case study demonstrating the problem. 

Therefore, while Itanium 2 is not specifically praised, it is not presented in a negative light either.

2004-01-01 - Increasing software-pipelined loops in the itanium-like architecture

Article:
The Itanium architecture (IPF) contains features such as register rotation to support efficient software pipelining. One of the drawbacks of software pipelining is its high register requirement, which may lead to failure when registers provided by architecture are insufficient. This paper evaluates the register requirements of software-pipelined loops in Itanium architecture and presents two new methods, which try to reduce static general register requirements in software pipelined loops by either reducing instructions in the loop body or allocating unused rotating registers for variants using static registers. We have implemented our methods in the Open Research Compiler (ORC) targeted for Itanium processors, and experiments show that number of software-pipelined loops in NAS Benchmarks increased. For some benchmarks, the performance is improved by more than 18%.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004. .

Article:
Flexible Architecture for Multiple Environments (FAME) is Bull architecture for large symmetrical multiprocessors based on Intel's Itanium 2 family, which is used in Bull NovaScale servers series. A key point in the development of this distributed shared memory architecture is the definition of its cache coherence protocol. This paper reports experiences and results of integrating formal verification of FAME cache coherence protocol, on 4 successive versions of this architecture. The goal is to find protocol definition bugs (not implementation) in the early phases of the design, focusing on: cache coherency, data integrity and deadlock-freeness properties. We have performed modeling and verification using Murcp tool and language, because of its easiness of use and its efficient state reduction techniques. The analysis of the results shows that this approach is cost-effective, and in spite of the state explosion problem, it has helped us in finding hard-to-simulate protocol bugs, before the implementation is far ahead.

2004-01-01 - Inter-procedural register allocation for RSE optimization

Article:
In Itanium architecture, a hardware managed register stack is introduced, register stack engine (RSE) can change the register stack frame pointers and spill/fill registers automatically. This mechanism can reduce load/store operations of register across call sites efficiently. The number of stacked registers used by a procedure could be specified by alloc instruction explicitly. Traditional intra-procedural register allocation algorithm will allocate max stacked registers required by a procedure but no more than the total number of stack registers. But a high stack register pressure will lead to frequent register stack spill/fill. If this event happens frequently, the performance will be seriously harmed. This paper proposes an innovative algorithm, which could reduce the RSE cost efficiently. This algorithm is already implemented in ORC. Experimental results show that the performance is improved obviously when this algorithm is applied, especially for perlbmk, it has 14% performance improvement and crafty also has 3.2% performance improvement. .

Response:
## Analysis of the Article's Sentiment towards Itanium:

This article focuses on optimizing the performance of the Itanium architecture, specifically addressing the issue of register stack spill/fill operations caused by the Register Stack Engine (RSE). The article highlights a problem that arises from the RSE: high stack register pressure leading to frequent spill/fill operations, negatively impacting performance.

**Problem:**  The article points out that while the RSE offers benefits for reducing load/store operations across call sites, the traditional intra-procedural register allocation algorithm can lead to excessive register stack pressure. This pressure results in frequent spill/fill operations, which are detrimental to performance. 

**Solution:** The article then introduces a novel algorithm designed to reduce RSE cost and improve performance. This algorithm is implemented in ORC and demonstrated to yield significant performance improvements, particularly for benchmarks like perlbmk (14% improvement) and crafty (3.2% improvement).

**Sentiment:** While the article acknowledges the benefits of the RSE in Itanium, it primarily focuses on a challenge associated with the RSE, i.e., high register stack pressure. The article then proposes a solution to this problem, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving performance. This focus on addressing a negative aspect of the RSE suggests a **slightly critical sentiment towards Itanium**.

Ispike is a post-link optimizer developed for the Intel Itanium Processor Family (IPF) processors. The IPF architecture poses both opportunities and challenges to post-link optimizations. IPF offers a rich set of performance counters to collect detailed profile information at a low cost, which is essential to post-link optimization being practical At the same time, the predication and bundling features on IPF make post-link code transformation more challenging than on other architectures. In Ispike, we have implemented optimizations like code layout, instruction prefetching, data layout, and data prefetching that exploit the IPF advantages, and strategies that cope with the IPF-specific challenges. Using SPEC CINT2000 as benchmarks, we show that Ispike improves performance by as much as 40% on the Itanium 2 processor, with average improvement of 8.5% and 9.9% over executables generated by the Intel Electron compiler and by the Gcc compiler, respectively. We also demonstrate that statistical profiles collected via IFF performance counters and complete profiles collected via instrumentation produce equal performance benefit, but the profiling overhead is significantly lower for performance counters. .

2004-01-01 - Multi-level approach for high-precision cache fault isolation - Case study: Itanium II processor low voltage cache yield improvement

Article:
Fault Isolation / Failure Analysis (FI/FA) of increasingly complex embedded memory in microprocessors is becoming more difficult due to process scaling and presence of subtle defects. As physical failure analysis (PFA) is destructive and involves expensive and time-consuming processes, fault diagnosis needs to be as precise as possible to ensure successful physical defect sighting. This paper introduces a cache Fault Isolation methodology that focuses on exhaustive data collection to derive concrete hypothesis of physical fault location and to overcome the existing FA/FI challenges. The methodology involves a novel application of existing DFT techniques in combination with circuit analysis, pattern hacking, defect localization and PFA tools. Some of the techniques, for example pattern modification or circuit simulation, are applied repeatedly in order to obtain higher-level of isolation - from cell/logic level to transistor/gate level, and finally down to physical structure/layer level. This multi-level FI approach is the key to localize the failing area to greater precision, which had proven itself in Intel Itanium II processor yield improvement process. .

2004-01-01 - Optimizing sparse matrix-vector product computations using unroll and jam

Article:
Large-scale scientific applications frequently compute sparse matrix-vector products in their computational core. For this reason, techniques for computing sparse matrix-vector products efficiently on modern architectures are important. In this paper we describe a strategy for improving the performance of sparse matrix-vector product computations using a loop transformation known as unroll-and-jam. We describe a novel sparse matrix representation that enables us to apply this transformation. Our approach is best suited for sparse matrices that have rows with a small number of predictable lengths. This work was motivated by sparse matrices that arise in SAGE, an application from Los Alamos National Laboratory. We evaluate the performance benefits of our approach using sparse matrices produced by SAGE for a pair of sample inputs. We show that our strategy is effective for improving sparse matrix-vector product performance using these matrices on MIPS R12000, Alpha Ev67, IBM Power 3, and Itanium 2 processors. Our measurements show that for this class of sparse matrices, our strategy improves sparse matrix-vector product performance from a low of 41% on MIPS to well over a factor of 2 on Itanium. .

2004-01-01 - Performance modeling of unstructured mesh particle transport computations

Article:
The performance of unstructured mesh applications presents a number of complexities and subtleties that do not arise for dense structured meshes. From a programming point of view, handling an unstructured mesh has an increased complexity to manage the necessary data structures and interactions between mesh-cells. From a performance point of view, there are added difficulties in understanding both the processing time on a single processor and the scaling characteristics. In this work we present a performance model for the calculation of deterministic SN transport on unstructured meshes. It builds upon earlier work that successfully modeled the same calculation on structured meshes. The model captures the key processing characteristics and is parametric using both the system performance data (latency, bandwidth, processing rate etc.) and application data (mesh size etc.) as input. The model is validated on two clusters (an HP AlphaServer and an Itanium-2 system) showing high accuracy. Importantly it is also shown that a single formulation of the model can be used to predict the performance of two quite different implementations of the same calculation. .

2004-01-01 - Pinpointing representative portions of large intel itanium programs with dynamic instrumentation

Article:
Detailed modeling of the performance of commercial applications is difficult. The applications can take a very long time to run on real hardware and it is impractical to simulate them to completion on performance models. Furthermore, these applications have complex execution environments that cannot easily be reproduced on a simulator, making porting the applications to simulators difficult. We attack these problems using the well-known SimPoint methodology to find representative portions of an application to simulate, and a dynamic instrumentation framework called Pin to avoid porting altogether. Our system uses dynamic instrumentation instead of simulation to find representative portions -called PinPoints - for simulation. We have developed a toolkit that automatically detects PinPoints, validates whether they are representative using hardware performance counters, and generates traces for large Itanium programs. We compared SimPoint-based selection to random selection of simulation points. We found for 95% of the SPEC2000 programs we tested, the PinPoints prediction was within 8% of the actual whole-program CPI, as opposed to 18% for random selection. We measure the end-to-end error, comparing real hardware to a performance model, and have a simple and efficient methodology to determine the step that introduced the error. Finally, we evaluate the system in the context of multiple configurations of real hardware, commercial applications, and industrial-strength performance models to understand the behavior of a complete and practical workload collection system. We have successfully used our system with many commercial Itanium programs, some running for trillions of instructions, and have used the resulting traces for predicting performance of those applications on future Itanium processors.  2004 IEEE. .

2004-01-01 - Platform-independent cache optimization by pinpointing low-locality reuse

Article:
For many applications, cache misses are the primary performance bottleneck. Even though much research has been performed on automatically optimizing cache behavior at the hardware and the compiler level, many program executions remain dominated by cache misses. Therefore, we propose to let the programmer optimize, who has a better high-level program overview, needed to resolve many cache problems. In order to assist the programmer, a visualization of memory accesses with poor locality is developed. The aim is to indicate causes of cache misses independent of actual cache parameters such as associativity or size. In that way, the programmer is steered towards platform-independent locality optimizations. The visualization was applied to three programs from the SPEC2000 benchmarks. After optimizing the source code based on the visualization, an average speedup of 3.06 was obtained on different platforms with Athlon, Itanium and Alpha processors; indicating the feasibility of platform-independent cache optimizations.

## Sentiment Analysis of Itanium in the Article:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on addressing the issue of cache misses as a performance bottleneck in various applications. It argues that despite advancements in hardware and compiler optimization, many programs still suffer from significant cache misses. To counter this, the article proposes a novel approach: empowering programmers with visualization tools to pinpoint memory access patterns with poor locality. These visualizations, independent of specific cache parameters, guide programmers towards platform-independent optimizations that improve cache performance.

**Sentiment Towards Itanium:**

The article mentions Itanium alongside Athlon and Alpha processors as part of the testing platform for the proposed optimization technique. It reports an "average speedup of 3.06" across these platforms after applying the visualization-based optimizations. This suggests that Itanium was **not a negative outlier** in the performance gains achieved by the proposed method. 

Furthermore, the article's focus on **platform-independent optimizations** implies that the optimization technique is equally applicable to different processor architectures, including Itanium. This hints at a **positive stance** towards Itanium's potential for benefitting from the proposed approach.

**Conclusion:**

While the article does not explicitly praise Itanium, it demonstrates that the optimization technique achieves significant performance improvements on Itanium, alongside other processor architectures. The platform-independent nature of the solution further indicates that Itanium is not a limitation to the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

**Sentiment Score:** [1] - Somewhat positive.

2004-01-01 - Prefetch injection based on hardware monitoring and object metadata

Article:
Cache miss stalls hurt performance because of the large gap between memory and processor speeds - for example, the popular server benchmark SPEC JBB2000 spends 45% of its cycles stalled waiting for memory requests on the Itanium 2 processor. Traversing linked data structures causes a large portion of these stalls. Prefetching for linked data structures remains a major challenge because serial data dependencies between elements in a linked data structure preclude the timely materialization of prefetch addresses. This paper presents Mississippi Delta (MS Delta), a novel technique for prefetching linked data structures that closely integrates the hardware performance monitor (HPM), the garbage collector's global view of heap and object layout, the type-level metadata inherent in type-safe programs, and JIT compiler analysis. The garbage collector uses the HPM's data cache miss information to identify cache miss intensive traversal paths through linked data structures, and then discovers regular distances (deltas) between these linked objects. JIT compiler analysis injects prefetch instructions using deltas to materialize prefetch addresses. We have implemented MS Delta in a fully dynamic profile-guided optimization system: the StarJIT dynamic compiler and the ORP Java virtual machine, We demonstrate a 28-29% reduction in stall cycles attributable to the high-latency cache misses targeted by MS Delta and a speedup of 11-14% on the cache miss intensive SPEC JBB2000 benchmark. .

2004-01-01 - QB or not QB: An efficient execution verification tool for memory orderings

Article:
We study the problem of formally verifying shared memory multiprocessor executions against memory consistency models - an important step during post-silicon verification of multiprocessor machines. We employ our previously reported style of writing formal specifications for shared memory models in higher order logic (HOL), obtaining intuitive as well as modular specifications. Our specification consists of a conjunction of rules that constrain the global visibility order. Given an execution to be checked, our algorithm generates Boolean constraints that capture the conditions under which the execution is legal under the visibility order. We initially took the approach of specializing the memory model HOL axioms into equivalent (for the execution to be checked) quantified boolean formulae (QBF). As this technique proved inefficient, we took the alternative approach of converting the HOL axioms into a program that generates a SAT instance when run on an execution. In effect, the quantifications in our memory model specification were realized as iterations in the program. The generated Boolean constraints are satisfiable if and only if the given execution is legal under the memory model. We evaluate two different approaches to encode the Boolean constraints, and also incremental techniques to generate and solve Boolean constraints. Key results include a demonstration that we can handle executions of realistic lengths for the modern Intel Itanium memory model. Further research into proper selection of Boolean encodings, incremental SAT checking, efficient handling of transitivity, and the generation of unsatisfiable cores for locating errors are expected to make our technique practical.

Article:
This paper presents the design, implementation and experimental evaluation of a practical region-based partial dead code elimination (PDE) algorithm on predicated code in an existing compiler framework. Our algorithm processes PDE candidates using a worklist and reasons about their partial deadness using predicate partition graphs. It operates uniformly on hyperblocks and regions comprising basic blocks and hyperblocks. The result of applying our algorithm to an SEME region is optimal: partially dead code cannot be removed without changing the branching structure of the program or potentially introducing new predicate defining instructions. We present statistic evidence about the PDE opportunities in the 12 SPECint2000 benchmarks. In addition to exhibit small compilation overheads, our algorithm achieves moderate performance improvements in 8 out of the 12 benchmarks on an Itanium machine. Our performance results and statistics show the usefulness of our algorithm as a pass applied before instruction scheduling.  Springer-Verlag 2004. .

2004-01-01 - Software implementations of division and square root operations for intel itanium processors

Article:
Division and square root are basic operations defined by the IEEE Standard 754-1985 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic [1], and are implemented in hardware in most modern processors. In recent years however, software implementations of these operations have become competitive. The first IEEE-correct implementations in software of the division and square root operations in a mainstream processor appeared in the 1980s [2]. Since then, several major processor architectures adopted similar solutions for division and square root algorithms, including the Intel Itanium Processor Family (IPF). Since the first software algorithms for division and square root were designed and used, improved algorithms were found and complete correctness proofs were carried out. It is maybe possible to improve these algorithms even further. The present paper gives an overview of the IEEE-correct division and square root algorithms for Itanium processors. As examples, a few algorithms for single precision are presented and properties used in proving their IEEE correctness are stated. Non-IEEE variants, less accurate but faster, of the division, square root and also reciprocal and reciprocal square root operations are discussed. Finally, accuracy and performance numbers are given. The algorithms presented here are inlined by the Intel and other compilers for IPF, whenever division and square root operations are performed. .

2004-01-01 - Software implementations of division and square root operations for intel itanium processors

Article:
Division and square root are basic operations defined by the IEEE Standard 754-1985 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic [1], and are implemented in hardware in most modern processors. In recent years however, software implementations of these operations have become competitive. The first IEEE-correct implementations in software of the division and square root operations in a mainstream processor appeared in the 1980s [2]. Since then, several major processor architectures adopted similar solutions for division and square root algorithms, including the Intel Itanium Processor Family (IPF). Since the first software algorithms for division and square root were designed and used, improved algorithms were found and complete correctness proofs were carried out. It is maybe possible to improve these algorithms even further. The present paper gives an overview of the IEEE-correct division and square root algorithms for Itanium processors. As examples, a few algorithms for single precision are presented and properties used in proving their IEEE correctness are stated. Non-IEEE variants, less accurate but faster, of the division, square root and also reciprocal and reciprocal square root operations are discussed. Finally, accuracy and performance numbers are given. The algorithms presented here are inlined by the Intel and other compilers for IPF, whenever division and square root operations are performed. . Keywords: Algorithms; Correctness proofs; Floating-point arithmetic; Itanium processor; Processor architectures; Software algorithms; Software implementation; Square-root algorithms; Square-root operations; Computer architecture;

2004-01-01 - Software pipelining: An effective scheduling technique for VLIW machines

Article:
The basic idea behind software pipelining was first developed by Patel and Davidson for scheduling hardware pipe-lines. As instruction-level parallelism made its way into general-purpose computing, it became necessary to automate scheduling. How and whether instructions can be scheduled statically have major ramifications on the design of computer architectures. Rau and Glaeser were the first to use software pipelining in a compiler for a machine with specialized hardware designed to support software pipelining. In the meantime, trace scheduling was touted to be the scheduling technique of choice for VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) machines. The most important contribution from this paper is to show that software pipelining is effective on VLIW machines without complicated hardware support. Our understanding of software pipelining subsequently deepened with the work of many others. And today, software pipelining is used in all advanced compilers for machines with instruction-level parallelism, none of which, except the Intel Itanium, relies on any specialized support for software pipelining. .

## Analysis of the Article's Sentiment towards Itanium:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article primarily focuses on the concept of software pipelining, a technique for optimizing instruction scheduling in computer architectures. It traces the historical development of this technique, highlighting its effectiveness for VLIW machines. 

**Discussion of Itanium:**

The article mentions Itanium only once, in the concluding sentence. It states that  "software pipelining is used in all advanced compilers for machines with instruction-level parallelism, none of which, except the Intel Itanium, relies on any specialized support for software pipelining."  

This statement implies the following:

* **Itanium is an exception:**  Itanium is unique among machines with instruction-level parallelism in requiring specialized support for software pipelining.
* **Implication of Complexity:** The need for specialized support suggests that Itanium's architecture might be more complex than other architectures that utilize software pipelining.
* **Lack of Widespread Adoption:** The statement indirectly suggests that Itanium was not as widely adopted as other architectures, as the statement focuses on "all advanced compilers" using software pipelining, except Itanium.

**Sentiment Analysis:**

While the article doesn't explicitly criticize Itanium, the single mention in the concluding sentence suggests that Itanium was a unique and potentially complex case.  This lack of widespread adoption and the need for specialized support could be interpreted as a slight negative implication.

**Sentiment Score:**  [-1] - Signs of critique (Sceptical of Itanium, or indirectly negative)

2004-01-01 - Super Scalar Sample Sort

Article:
Sample sort, a generalization of quicksort that partitions the input into many pieces, is known as the best practical comparison based sorting algorithm for distributed memory parallel computers. We show that sample sort is also useful on a single processor. The main algorithmic insight is that element comparisons can be decoupled from expensive conditional branching using predicated instructions. This transformation facilitates optimizations like loop unrolling and software pipelining. The final implementation, albeit cache efficient, is limited by a linear number of memory accesses rather than the (n log n) comparisons. On an Itanium 2 machine, we obtain a speedup of up to 2 over std::sort from the GCC STL library, which is known as one of the fastest available quicksort implementations.  Springer-Verlag 2004. .

2004-01-01 - SYZYGY - A framework for scalable cross-module IPO

Article:
Performing analysis across module boundaries for an entire program is important for exploiting several runtime performance opportunities. However, due to scalability problems in existing full-program analysis frameworks, such performance opportunities are only realized by paying tremendous compile-time costs. Alternative solutions, such as partial compilations or user assertions, are complicated or unsafe and as a result, not many commercial applications are compiled today with cross-module optimizations. This paper presents SYZYGY, a practical framework for performing efficient, scalable, interprocedural optimizations. The framework is implemented in the HP-UX Itanium compilers and we have successfully compiled many very large applications consisting of millions of lines of code. We achieved performance improvements of up to 40% over optimization level two and compilation time improvements in the order of 100% and more compared to a previous approach. .

Article:
In this paper we report on our experiences with hybrid parallelism in PARDISO, a high-performance sparse linear solver. We start with the OpenMP-parallel numerical factorization algorithm and reorganize it using a central dynamic task queue to be able to add message passing functionality. The hybrid version allows the solver to run on a larger number of processors in a cost effective way with very reasonable performance. A speed-up of more than nine running on a four-node quad Itanium 2 SMP cluster is achieved in spite of the fact that a large potential to minimize MPI communication is not yet exploited in the first version of the implementation.

2004-01-01 - Testing and Reliability Techniques for High-Bandwidth Embedded RAMs

Article:
Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and high-performance processors such as Itanium and Compaq Alpha use a total of almost 75% of chip real estate for accommodating various types of embedded (or on-chip) memories. Although most of these embedded memories are single-port static (and in relatively few cases, dynamic) RAMs today, the high demand for bandwidth in digital television, fast signal processing, and high-speed networking applications will also fuel the need for on-chip multiport memories in the foreseeable future. The reliability of a complex VLSI chip will depend largely on the reliability of these embedded memory blocks. With device dimensions moving rapidly toward the ultimate physical limits of device scaling, which is in the regime of feature sizes of 50 nm or so, a host of complex failure modes is expected to occur in memory circuits. This tutorial underlines the need for appropriate testing and reliability techniques for the present to the next generation of embedded RAMs. Topics covered include: reliability and quality testing, fault modeling, advanced built-in self-test (BIST), built-in self-diagnosis (BISD), and built-in self-repair (BISR) techniques for high-bandwidth embedded RAMs. .

2004-01-01 - The compiler as a validation and evaluation tool

Article:
Like a processor executes flawlessly at different frequencies, a compiler should produce correct results at any optimization level. The Intel Itanium processor family with its new features, like the register stack engine and control- and data speculation, provides new and unique challenges for ported software and compiler technology. This paper describes validation and evaluation techniques that can be employed in compilation tools and can help to get a cleaner port of an application, a more robust compilation system and even insights into performance tuning opportunities. Using Itanium as a specific example, the paper explains why the register stack engine (RSE), the large register file, or control- and data speculation can potentially expose bugs in poorly written or compiled software. It then demonstrates validation and evaluation techniques to find or expose these bugs. An evaluation team can employ them to find, eliminate and evaluate software bugs. A compiler team can use them to make the compiler more stable and robust. A performance analysis team can use them to uncover performance opportunities in an application. We demonstrate our validation and evaluation techniques on code examples and provide run-time data to indicate the cost of some of our methods. 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. .

2004-01-01 - WBTK: A new set of microbenchmarks to explore memory system performance for scientific computing

Article:
Memory hierarchies are a key component in obtaining high performance on modern microprocessors. To satisfy the ever-increasing demand on data rate access, they are also becoming increasingly complex: multilevel caches, non-blocking caches, sophisticated instructions for supporting prefetch and cache control, etc. If all of these advanced features promise to offer large performance gains, they also generate in some cases performance "anomalies" (i.e. bad performance triggered by specific code patterns). For precisely locating and understanding these anomalies, a new set of microbenchmarks called WBTK is introduced. We show through systematic experimentation on Alpha 21264, Power4 and Itanium 1 that this microbenchmark first allowed us to detect most of the anomalies encountered on simple BLAS1 type codes. Secondly, it led us to demonstrate that vectorization of memory access was an efficient workaround for most of these anomalies. .

The article focuses on the development and application of a new set of microbenchmarks called WBTK. The goal of WBTK is to **analyze memory system performance, specifically to identify and understand performance anomalies that arise from complex memory hierarchies in modern microprocessors**. These anomalies can be detrimental to performance, especially in scientific computing applications. 

The authors use WBTK to conduct systematic experiments on three different microprocessor architectures: Alpha 21264, Power4, and **Itanium 1**. The article highlights that WBTK helped them **detect most of the anomalies encountered on simple BLAS1 type codes** and that **vectorization of memory access was an efficient workaround for these anomalies**. 

**Itanium 1 is mentioned as one of the platforms where WBTK was used.** However, the article does not explicitly express any positive or negative sentiment towards Itanium 1. It merely reports the results obtained using the microbenchmarks on this platform alongside the other two architectures. 

**Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium 1 in this article is neutral [0].**  The article focuses on the methodology and results of the microbenchmark analysis rather than providing an opinion about the performance of specific architectures.

2005-01-01 - A general performance model of structured and unstructured mesh particle transport computations

Article:
The performance of unstructured mesh applications presents a number of complexities and subtleties that do not arise for dense structured meshes. From a programming point of view, the handling of unstructured meshes has an increased complexity in order to manage the necessary data structures and interactions between mesh-cells. From a performance point of view, there are added difficulties in understanding both the processing time on a single processor and the scaling characteristics when using large-scale parallel systems. In this work we present a general performance model for the calculation of deterministic S N transport on unstructured meshes that is also applicable to structured meshes. The model captures the key processing characteristics of the calculation and is parametric using both system performance data (latency, bandwidth, processing rate etc.) and application data (mesh size etc.) as input. A single formulation of the model is used to predict the performance of two quite different implementations of the same calculation. It is validated on two clusters (an HP AlphaServer and an Itanium-2 system) showing high prediction accuracy.  2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. .

The core goal is to provide a framework that predicts the performance of these computations across different architectures, including large-scale parallel systems.  

The article highlights the challenges of unstructured meshes in terms of programming complexity and performance analysis compared to structured meshes. It then introduces a performance model that is "parametric using both system performance data (latency, bandwidth, processing rate etc.) and application data (mesh size etc.) as input." This model is validated on two different clusters: an HP AlphaServer and an Itanium-2 system. 

The article states that the model "is validated on two clusters (an HP AlphaServer and an Itanium-2 system) showing high prediction accuracy." This indicates that the model works well for both systems, including Itanium-2. 

While the article does not explicitly praise or criticize Itanium, it uses it as one of the test platforms for its performance model. The fact that the model achieves "high prediction accuracy" on the Itanium-2 system suggests that the platform performs well within the model's framework. 

**Therefore, the article can be considered neutral [0] towards Itanium. It does not explicitly express any negative or positive sentiment but uses it as a test case for its performance model, highlighting its effectiveness in predicting performance.**

2005-01-01 - An empirical study of data speculation use on the intel itanium 2 processor

Article:
The Intel Itanium architecture uses a dedicated 32-entry hardware table, the Advanced Load Address Table (ALAT) to support data speculation via an instruction set interface. This study presents an empirical evaluation of the use of the ALAT and data speculative instructions for several optimizing compilers. We determined what and how often compilers generated the different speculative instructions, and used the Itanium's hardware performance counters to evaluate their run-time behavior. We also performed a limit study by modifying one compiler to always generate data speculation when possible. We found that this aggressive approach significantly increased the amount of data speculation and often resulted in performance improvements, of as much as 10% in one case. Since it worsened performance only for one application and then only for some inputs, we conclude that more aggressive data speculation heuristics than those employed by current compilers are desirable and may further improve performance gains from data speculation. .

2005-01-01 - Analyis of path profiling information generated with performance monitoring hardware

Article:
Even with the breakthroughs in semiconductor technology that will enable billion transistor designs, hardwarebased architecture paradigms alone cannot substantially improve processor performance. The challenge in realizing the full potential of these future machines is to find ways to adapt program behavior to application needs and processor resources. As such, run-time optimization will have a distinct role in future high performance systems. However, as these systems are dependent on accurate, fine-grain profile information, traditional approaches to collecting profiles at run-time result in significant slowdowns during program execution. A novel approach to low-overhead profiling is to exploit hardware Performance Monitoring Units (PMUs) present in modern microprocessors. The Itanium-2 PMU can periodically sample the last few taken branches in an executing program and this information can be used to recreate partial paths of execution. With compiler-aided analysis, the partial paths can be correlated into full paths. As statistically hot paths are most likely to occur in PMU samples, even infrequent sampling can accurately identify these paths. While traditional path profiling techniques carry a high overhead, a PMU-based path profiler represents an effective lightweight profiling alternative. This paper characterizes the PMU-based path information and demonstrates the construction of such a PMU-based path profiler for a run-time system. .

2005-01-01 - Cache aware optimization of stream programs

Article:
Effective use of the memory hierarchy is critical for achieving high performance on embedded systems. We focus on the class of streaming applications, which is increasingly prevalent in the embedded domain. We exploit the widespread parallelism and regular communication patterns in stream programs to formulate a set of cache aware optimizations that automatically improve instruction and data locality. Our work is in the context of the Synchronous Dataflow model, in which a program is described as a graph of independent actors that communicate over channels. The communication rates between actors are known at compile time, allowing the compiler to statically model the caching behavior. We present three cache aware optimizations: 1) execution scaling, which judiciously repeats actor executions to improve instruction locality, 2) cache aware fusion, which combines adjacent actors while respecting instruction cache constraints, and 3) scalar replacement, which converts certain data buffers into a sequence of scalar variables that can be register allocated. The optimizations are founded upon a simple and intuitive model that quantifies the temporal locality for a sequence of actor executions. Our implementation of cache aware optimizations in the StreamIt compiler yields a 249% average speedup (over unoptimized code) for our streaming benchmark suite on a StrongARM 1110 processor. The optimizations also yield a 154% speedup on a Pentium 3 and a 152% speedup on an Itanium 2. Copyright 2005 ACM. .

2005-01-01 - Cache aware optimization of stream programs

Article:
Effective use of the memory hierarchy is critical for achieving high performance on embedded systems. We focus on the class of streaming applications, which is increasingly prevalent in the embedded domain. We exploit the widespread parallelism and regular communication patterns in stream programs to formulate a set of cache aware optimizations that automatically improve instruction and data locality. Our work is in the context of the Synchronous Dataflow model, in which a program is described as a graph of independent actors that communicate over channels. The communication rates between actors are known at compile time, allowing the compiler to statically model the caching behavior. We present three cache aware optimizations: 1) execution scaling, which judiciously repeats actor executions to improve instruction locality, 2) cache aware fusion, which combines adjacent actors while respecting instruction cache constraints, and 3) scalar replacement, which converts certain data buffers into a sequence of scalar variables that can be register allocated. The optimizations are founded upon a simple and intuitive model that quantifies the temporal locality for a sequence of actor executions. Our implementation of cache aware optimizations in the StreamIt compiler yields a 249% average speedup (over unoptimized code) for our streaming benchmark suite on a StrongARM 1110 processor. The optimizations also yield a 154% speedup on a Pentium 3 and a 152% speedup on an Itanium 2. Copyright 2005 ACM. .

2005-01-01 - Compiler optimization-space exploration

Article:
To meet the performance demands of modern architectures, compilers incorporate an ever-increasing number of aggressive code transformations. Since most of these transformations are not universally beneficial, compilers traditionally control their application through predictive heuristics, which attempt to judge an optimization's effect on final code quality a priori. However, complex target architectures and unpredictable optimization interactions severely limit the accuracy of these judgments, leading to performance degradation because of poor optimization decisions. This performance loss can be avoided through the iterative compilation approach, which advocates exploring many optimization options and selecting the best one a posteriori. However, existing iterative compilation systems suffer from excessive compile times and narrow application domains. By overcoming these limitations, Optimization-Space Exploration (OSE) becomes the first iterative compilation technique suitable for general-purpose production compilers. OSE narrows down the space of optimization options explored through limited use of heuristics. A compiler tuning phase further limits the exploration space. At compile time, OSE prunes the remaining optimization configurations in the search space by exploiting feedback from earlier configurations tried. Finally, rather than measuring actual runtimes, OSE compares optimization outcomes through static performance estimation, further enhancing compilation speed. An OSE-enhanced version of Intel's reference compiler for the Itanium architecture yields a performance improvement of more than 20% for some SPEC benchmarks. . Keywords:;

2005-01-01 - Design of a software distributed shared memory system using an MPI communication layer

Article:
We designed and implemented a software distributed shared memory (DSM) system, SCASH-MPI, by using MPI as the communication layer of the SCASH DSM. With MPI as the communication layer, we could use high-speed networks with several clusters and high portability. Furthermore, SCASH-MPI can use high-speed networks with MPI, which is the most commonly available communication library. On the other hand, existing software DSM systems usually use a dedicated communication layer, TCP, or UDP-Ethernet. SCASH-MPI avoids the need for a large amount of pin-down memory for shared memory use that has limited the applications of the original SCASH. In SCASH-MPI, a thread is created to support remote memory communication using MPI. An experiment on a 4-node Itanium cluster showed that the Laplace Solver benchmark using SCASH-MPI achieves a performance comparable to the original SCASH. Performance degradation is only 6.3% in the NPB BT benchmark Class B test. In SCASH-MPI, page transfer does not start until a page fault is detected. To hide the latency of page transmission, we implemented a prefetch function. The latency in BT Class B was reduced by 64% when the prefetch function was used.  2005 IEEE. .

2005-01-01 - Efficiently implementing LL/SC objects shared by an unknown number of processes

Article:
Over the past decade, a pair of instructions called load-linked (LL) and store-conditional (SC) have emerged as the most suitable synchronization instructions for the design of lock-free algorithms. However, current architectures do not support these instructions; instead, they support either CAS (e.g., UltraSPARC, Itanium) or restricted versions of LL/SC (e.g., POWER4, MIPS, Alpha). To bridge this gap, a flurry of algorithms that implement LL/SC from CAS have appeared in the literature. Some of these algorithms assume that N, the maximum number of participating processes, is fixed and known in advance. Others make no such assumption, but are either non-blocking (not wait-free), implement small LL/SC objects, or require that a process performs O(N) work to join the algorithm. Specifically, no constant-time, word-sized, wait-free LL/SC algorithm that does not require the knowledge of N exists. In this paper, we present such an algorithm.

## Analyzing the Sentiment Towards Itanium

The article focuses on the development of efficient Load-Linked (LL) and Store-Conditional (SC) instructions, crucial for lock-free algorithms. These instructions are not directly supported by most architectures, including Itanium, which instead relies on Compare-and-Swap (CAS) instructions. 

The article acknowledges this gap by mentioning that a "flurry of algorithms" attempt to implement LL/SC from CAS. However, it highlights the shortcomings of these algorithms, particularly those assuming a fixed and known number of processes (N) or those that are non-blocking or require significant overhead. The article then presents its own algorithm as a solution that overcomes these limitations, achieving constant-time, word-sized, wait-free LL/SC without requiring prior knowledge of N.

**Itanium is specifically mentioned as using CAS instructions instead of LL/SC.** This implies that the article acknowledges Itanium's approach, but it does not explicitly endorse or criticize it. The article's focus is on presenting its own algorithm as a solution to the broader problem of implementing LL/SC efficiently, rather than evaluating specific architectures or their synchronization mechanisms.

**Therefore, the article is neutral towards Itanium.**  It simply acknowledges the architecture's use of CAS instead of LL/SC, without expressing any positive or negative sentiment.

**Sentiment Score: [0] - Neutral**

2005-01-01 - Fine-grain stacked register allocation for the itanium architecture

Article:
The introduction of a hardware managed register stack in the Itanium Architecture creates an opportunity to optimize both the frequency in which a compiler requests allocation of registers from this stack and the number of registers requested. The Itanium Architecture specifies the implementation of a Register Stack Engine (RSE) that automatically performs register spills and fills. However, if the compiler requests too many registers, through the alloc instruction, the RSE will be forced to execute unnecessary spill and fill operations. In this paper we introduce the formulation of the fine-grain register stack frame sizing problem. The normal interaction between the compiler and the RSE suggested by the Itanium Architecture designers is for the compiler to request the maximum number of registers required by a procedure at the procedure invocation. Our new problem formulation allows for more conservative stack register allocation because it acknowledges that the number of registers required in different control flow paths varies significantly. We introduce a basic algorithm to solve the stack register allocation problem, and present our preliminary performance results from the implementation of our algorithm in the Open64 compiler.

## Analysis of the Article's Sentiment Towards Itanium:

**Topic/Goal:**

The article focuses on optimizing register allocation for the Itanium architecture. It acknowledges the existence of the Itanium's Register Stack Engine (RSE) which manages register spills and fills. However, the authors identify a potential inefficiency: compilers often request a maximum number of registers for a procedure, leading to unnecessary spill and fill operations.

The goal of the article is to propose a new approach: "fine-grain register stack frame sizing". This approach aims to allocate fewer registers based on the varying register requirements in different control flow paths, thereby improving efficiency.

**Sentiment:**

While the article acknowledges the strengths of the Itanium architecture and its RSE, it highlights a potential area for improvement. The authors present their work as a way to enhance the existing Itanium architecture by optimizing register allocation. The focus on solving a specific problem with the RSE suggests a constructive and problem-solving approach rather than outright criticism. 

**Conclusion:**

The authors discuss a specific challenge within the Itanium architecture and offer a potential solution. While they point out a shortcoming, they do so with the intention of improving performance and not to disparage the architecture itself.

**Sentiment Score: [1] - Somewhat positive.**

2005-01-01 - Generating cache hints for improved program efficiency

Article:
One of the new extensions in EPIC architectures are cache hints. On each memory instruction, two kinds of hints can be attached: a source cache hint and a target cache hint. The source hint indicates the true latency of the instruction, which is used by the compiler to improve the instruction schedule. The target hint indicates at which cache levels it is profitable to retain data, allowing to improve cache replacement decisions at run time. A compile-time method is presented which calculates appropriate cache hints. Both kind of hints are based on the locality of the instruction, measured by the reuse distance metric. Two alternative methods are discussed. The first one profiles the reuse distance distribution, and selects a static hint for each instruction. The second method calculates the reuse distance analytically, which allows to generate dynamic hints, i.e. the best hint for each memory access is calculated at run-time. The implementation of the static hints scheme in the Open64-compiler for the Itanium processor shows a speedup of 10% on average on a set of pointer-intensive and regular loop-based programs. The analytical approach with dynamic hints was implemented in the FPT-compiler and shows up to 34% reduction in cache misses.  2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. .

2005-01-01 - Hardware-software collaborative techniques for runtime profiling and phase transition detection

Article:
Dynamic optimization relies on runtime profile information to improve the performance of program execution. Traditional profiling techniques incur significant overhead and are not suitable for dynamic optimization. In this paper, a new profiling technique is proposed, that incorporates the strength of both software and hardware to achieve near-zero overhead profiling. The compiler passes profiling requests as a few bits of information in branch instructions to the hardware, and the processor executes profiling operations asynchronously in available free slots or on dedicated hardware. The compiler instrumentation of this technique is implemented using an Itanium research compiler. The result shows that the accurate block profiling incurs very little overhead to the user program in terms of the program scheduling cycles. For example, the average overhead is 0.6% for the SPECint95 benchmarks. The hardware support required for the new profiling is practical. The technique is extended to collect edge profiles for continuous phase transition detection. It is believed that the hardware-software collaborative scheme will enable many profile-driven dynamic optimizations for EPIC processors such as the Itanium processors.  2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. .

The instruction scheduler is one of the weakest points of GCC on IA-64 architecture. This paper will describe an ongoing project for improving GCC instruction scheduling for Itanium. We aim at adding support for IA-64 control and data speculation to GCC, doing this similarly to the existing implementation of interblock motions. Our work on this issue forces us to address weakness of the alias analysis used in the scheduler. Absence of the address displacement on IA-64 makes the problem even more relevant. We suggest the following improvements: 1) propagation of points-to information from tree-ssa to RTL for pointers, and 2) tracking pointer arithmetic, which is performed for addressing non-pointer variables, in alias.c. .

2005-01-01 - Itanium  A system implementors tale

Article:
Itanium is a fairly new and rather unusual architecture. Its defining feature is explicitly-parallel instruction-set computing (EPIC), which moves the onus for exploiting instruction-level parallelism (ILP) from the hardware to the code generator. Itanium theoretically supports high degrees of ILP, but in practice these are hard to achieve, as present compilers are often not up to the task. This is much more a problem for systems than for application code, as compiler writers efforts tend to be focused on SPEC benchmarks, which are not representative of operating systems code. As a result, good OS performance on Itanium is a serious challenge, but the potential rewards are high. EPIC is not the only interesting and novel feature of Itanium. Others include an unusual MMU, a huge register set, and tricky virtualisation issues. We present a number of the challenges posed by the architecture, and show how they can be overcome by clever design and implementation.  2005 USENIX Association. All rights reserved. .

2005-01-01 - Making CSB+-trees processor conscious

Article:
Cache-conscious indexes, such as CSB+-tree, are sensitive to the underlying processor architecture. In this paper, we focus on how to adapt the CSB+-tree so that it performs well on a range of different processor architectures. Previous work has focused on the impact of node size on the performance of the CSB+-tree. We argue that it is necessary to consider a larger group of parameters in order to adapt CSB+-tree to processor architectures as different as Pentium and Itanium. We identify this group of parameters and study how it impacts the performance of CSB+-tree on Itanium 2. Finally, we propose a systematic method for adapting CSB+-tree to new platforms. This work is a first step towards integrating CSB+-tree in MySQL's heap storage manager. Copyright 2005 ACM. .

2005-01-01 - Module-aware translation for real-life desktop applications

Article:
A dynamic binary translator is a just-in-time compiler that translates source architecture binaries into target architecture binaries on the fly. It enables the fast running of the source architecture binaries on the target architecture. Traditional dynamic binary translators invalidate their translations when a module is unloaded, so later reloading of the same module will lead to a full retranslation. Moreover, most of the loading and unloading are performed on a few "hot" modules, which causes the dynamic binary translator to spend a significant amount of time on repeatedly translating these "hot" modules. Furthermore, the retranslation may lead to excessive memory consumption if the code pages containing the translated codes that have been invalidated are not timely recycled. In addition, we observed that the overhead for translating real-life desktop applications is a big challenge to the overall performance of the applications, and our detailed analysis proved that real-life desktop applications dynamically load and unload modules much more frequently as compared to popular benchmarks, such as SPEC CPU2000. To address these issues, we propose a translation reuse engine that uses a novel verification method and a module-aware memory management mechanism. The proposed approach was fully implemented in IA-32 Execution Layer (IA-32 EL) [1], a commercial dynamic binary translator that enables the execution of IA-32 applications on Intel Itanium processor family. Collected results show that the module-aware translation improves the performance of Adobe* Illustrator by 14.09% and Microsoft* Publisher by 9.73%. The overhead brought by the translation reuse engine accounts for no more than 0.2% of execution time. Copyright 2005 ACM. .

2005-01-01 - MX2 processor module: Twice the processors in half the volume

Article:
Computer manufacturer's are constantly trying to tweek more performance out of their existing products by using the highest performing processors. Typically, manufacturers upgrade the platforms by simply replacing the old processor with the latest speed processor. Like other manufacturers, HP generally follows this practice with the exception ot HP's innovative mx2 module. This unique module used two Itanium-2 "Madison" processors packaged in the same physical volume as a single Itanium-2 processor. In addition, the module plugs into a standard Itanium-2 motherboard socket and requires no additional power capacity. As a result, the development team was able get 50% more performance[1] from a socket without increasing power by actively managing the power to the two processors. Thus, the performance per watt was substantially improved. This paper will provide an overview of some of the key packaging and power innovations that made the processor module a reality such as: 1) mezzanine power for space savings. The standard Itanium 2 processor has a power converter adjacent to the processor. HP engineers chose to put power on top of the processor which provided more room but made cooling the processors a challenge. 2) high performance mechnical gap filler. One of the biggest issues in the module was to develop a thermal gap filler that absorbed 0.060" of tolerance between the two processors. The thermal resistance of this technology was an order of magnitude better than anything commercially available in the industry. 3) Power Aware Architecture. This newly developed power mangement technology actively controls power to the processors. When system (thermal and power) extremes were exceeded by worst case abnormal code, the performance was throttled down until the worst case scenario had past. The combination of these advancements has delivered an innovative solution for a highly challenging design problem. This module is now shipping as the mx2 processor module in HP's Integrity Servers and has been viewed as an engineering marvel by HP executives. Copyright  2005 by ASME. .

2005-01-01 - N-bit unsigned division via N-bit multiply-add

Article:
Integer division on modern processors is expensive compared to multiplication. Previous algorithms for performing unsigned division by an invariant divisor, via reciprocal approximation, suffer in the worst case from a common requirement for n+1 bit multiplication, which typically must be synthesized from n-bit multiplication and extra arithmetic operations. This paper presents, and proves, a hybrid of previous algorithms that replaces n+1 bit multiplication with a single fused multiply-add operation on n-bit operands, thus reducing any n-bit unsigned division to the upper n bits of a multiply-add, followed by a single right shift. An additional benefit is that the prerequisite calculations are simple and fast. On the Itanium 2 processor, the technique is advantageous for as few as two quotients that share a common run-time divisor.  2005 IEEE. .

2005-01-01 - Near overhead-free heterogeneous thread-migration

Article:
Thread migration moves a single call-stack to another machine to improve either load balancing or locality. Current approaches for checkpointing and thread migration are either not heterogeneous or they introduce large runtime overhead. In general, previous approaches add overhead by instrumenting each function in a program. The instrumentation costs are then even incurred when no thread migration is performed. In this respect our system is near-overhead free: nearly no overhead is caused if no migration is performed. Our implementation instead generates metafunctions for each location in the code where a function is called. These functions portably save and rebuild activation records to and from a machine-independent format. Each variable of an activation record is described in terms of its usages in a machine-independent 'Usage Descriptor String' to enable heterogeneous, near overhead free thread migration with as few as possible changes to a compiler. Our resulting thread migration solution is, for example, able to move a thread between an x86 machine (few registers, 32 bits) and an Itanium machine (many registers, 64 bits). Furthermore, we (optionally) move the decision on when and where to migrate to the application programmer instead of implementing a fixed 'fits-all' heuristics as in previous approaches. .

## Sentiment Analysis of Itanium in the Article

The article focuses on achieving near-overhead-free heterogeneous thread migration. This means the ability to move a thread's execution from one type of machine to another, even if they have different architectures, with minimal performance impact.  

The article highlights the problem with existing thread migration approaches: they often require instrumenting every function in a program, introducing overhead even when migration is not performed. 

The solution presented by the article is based on generating "metafunctions" that handle the saving and rebuilding of activation records (the state of a function's execution) in a machine-independent format.  This eliminates the need for instrumentation and achieves near-overhead-free migration. 

**Regarding Itanium:**

* The article mentions Itanium specifically as an example of a different architecture that their solution can handle.  
* It uses the phrase "x86 machine (few registers, 32 bits) and an Itanium machine (many registers, 64 bits)" to illustrate the ability of their system to handle the differences between these architectures. 
* It highlights Itanium's larger number of registers and 64-bit architecture.

**Analysis:**

This implies the authors are aware of Itanium's features and consider it a valid target for their heterogeneous thread migration system. The article doesn't express any criticism or negativity towards Itanium. It simply mentions it as an example of a successful architecture migration scenario.

**Sentiment Score:**  [1] - Somewhat Positive

2005-01-01 - Neutron ser characterization of microprocessors

Article:
Hadrons generated by the primary cosmic rays penetrating the atmosphere have a negative impact on the reliability of semiconductor devices. The electrical charge induced by high energy particles manifests as a current spike and can affect both storage elements and combinational logic. Frequency of occurrence of the errors induced by this failure mechanism is referred to as soft error rate (SER). Continuous shrinking of the electronic devices and the lower supply voltages, in conjunction with the increased complexity of VLSI circuits, have led to higher SER. The impact of semiconductor technology scaling on neutron induced SER is discussed in this report. The experimental methodology and results of accelerated measurements carried out on Intel Itanium microprocessors, at Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE), are presented. Statistically significant values of the MTTF induced by high-energy neutrons are also derived, as a function of the number of upsets observed over the duration of the experiment. The presented approach doesn't require any proprietary data about the microprocessor under evaluation and, as a consequence, can be used as a dependability benchmarking tool both by manufacturers and independent evaluators.  2005 IEEE. .

Today's applications are being built in new ways. The advent of service-oriented architectures, modern networking protocols and industry-standard components at all levels open seemingly endless possibilities for new applications and services. But these new possibilities carry new challenges as well, especially in the area of highperformance, mission-critical, transactional applications, often involving financial and other sensitive data which carries security and auditability requirements. This talk will focus on the particular challenges for servers and how these challenges are being addressed. The NonStop Enterprise Division of HP (formerly Tandem Computers) has built massively parallel, hardware and software fault-tolerant servers since 1975. These servers power many of the most challenging transaction processing environments that exist, including major stock exchanges, funds transfer applications, credit and debit card applications, E911 applications, major telephony and instant messaging applications, and integrated hospital applications. The system is based on a message-oriented architecture and thus bears many similarities internally to the architectural principals being espoused for today's service-oriented architectures. HP is bringing to market a new generation of Integrity NonStop Servers, based on an innovative design using Intel Itanium 2 processors and leveraging many other industry standards. This talk will describe how the new generation of servers can accomplish even higher levels of availability than current systems while at the same time leveraging industry standards and meeting other extreme requirements. The talk will also touch on the lessons learned over the years when dealing with mission-critical applications and how those lessons apply to today's distributed, service-oriented architectures. The underlying message is that careful use of encapsulation, limiting the use of distributed algorithms to carefully controlled situations, and overall design rigor are required even more than ever.  2005 IEEE. .

2005-01-01 - Optimizing structures in object oriented programs

Article:
In this paper we demonstrate that effective structure optimization is essential to improve code quality and reduce compilation overhead for object-oriented programs. We propose to address this problem by using an effective representation of structure operation, folding indirect memory accesses to structure fields, flattening structures judiciously, and allowing more aggressive procedure inlining, These techniques enable the existing scalar optimizations, which were well tuned for the traditional imperative languages, to work effectively on object-oriented programs, allowing them to make better use of the performance enhancing-features available on modern processors. We have implemented this strategy in an SSA based global optimization framework in the Open Research Compiler, targeting the Itanium Processor Family. The experimental results with representative C++ benchmarks show that the applications' performance can be improved significantly. For instance, Eon's performance is improved by 35.6%, while the execution time of the Stepanov benchmark is reduced by a factor of 24. .

Title:
2005-01-01 - Pairwise local structural alignment of RNA sequences with sequence similarity less than 40%

Article:
Motivation: Searching for non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes and structural RNA elements (eleRNA) are major challenges in gene finding today as these often are conserved in structure rather than in sequence. Even though the number of available methods is growing, it is still of interest to pairwise detect two genes with low sequence similarity, where the genes are part of a larger genomic region. Results: Here we present such an approach for pairwise local alignment which is based on FOLDALIGN and the Sankoff algorithm for simultaneous structural alignment of multiple sequences. We include the ability to conduct mutual scans of two sequences of arbitrary length while searching for common local structural motifs of some maximum length. This drastically reduces the complexity of the algorithm. The scoring scheme includes structural parameters corresponding to those available for free energy as well as for substitution matrices similar to RIBOSUM. The new FOLDALIGN implementation is tested on a dataset where the ncRNAs and eleRNAs have sequence similarity <40% and where the ncRNAs and eleRNAs are energetically indistinguishable from the surrounding genomic sequence context. The method is tested in two ways: (1) its ability to find the common structure between the genes only and (2) its ability to locate ncRNAs and eleRNAs in a genomic context. In case (1), it makes sense to compare with methods like Dynalign, and the performances are very similar, but FOLDALIGN is substantially faster. The structure prediction performance for a family is typically around 0.7 using Matthews correlation coefficient. In case (2), the algorithm is successful at locating RNA families with an average sensitivity of 0.8 and a positive predictive value of 0.9 using a BLAST-like hit selection scheme.  The Author 2005.

2005-01-01 - Performance improvements for GCC using architecture features on IA-64

Article:
The Intel IA-64 architecture provides a rich set of features to aid the compiler in exploiting instruction-level parallelism to achieve high performance. Currently, GCC is a widely used open source compiler on IA-64 platform, but its performance, especially floating-point performance is poor compared with commercial compilers because it has not fully utilized those features. We have been absorbed in improving performance of GCC on IA-64 architecture since late 2003. This paper reports some of our work on several algorithms concerning with architecture features of IA-64 for achieving higher floating-point performance of GCC, including FORTRAN alias analysis, induction variable optimizations, loop unrolling, and prefetch of loop arrays. These improvements have markedly optimized the floatingpoint performance of GCC on Itanium-2 systems. .

2005-01-01 - Performance of OSCAR multigrain parallelizing compiler on SMP servers

Article:
This paper describes performance of OSCAR multigrain parallelizing compiler on various SMP servers, such as IBM pSeries 690, Sun Fire V880, Sun Ultra 80, NEC TX7/i6010 and SGI Altix 3700. The OSCAR compiler hierarchically exploits the coarse grain task parallelism among loops, subroutines and basic blocks and the near fine grain parallelism among statements inside a basic block in addition to the loop parallelism. Also, it allows us global cache optimization over different loops, or coarse grain tasks, based on data localization technique with inter-array padding to reduce memory access overhead. Current performance of OSCAR compiler is evaluated on the above SMP servers. For example, the OSCAR compiler generating OpenMP parallelized programs from ordinary sequential Fortran programs gives us 5.7 times speedup, in the average of seven programs, such as SPEC CFP95 tomcatv, swim, su2cor, hydro2d, mgrid, applu and turb3d, compared with IBM XL Fortran compiler 8.1 on IBM pSeries 690 24 processors SMP server. Also, it gives us 2.6 times speedup compare with Intel Fortran Itanium Compiler 7.1 on SGI Altix 3700 Itanium 2 16 processors server, 1.7 times speedup compared with NEC Fortran Itanium Compiler 3.4 on NEC TX7/i6010 Itanium 2 8 processors server, 2.5 times speedup compared with Sun Forte 7.0 on Sun Ultra 80 UltraSPARC II 4 processors desktop workstation, and 2.1 times speedup compare with Sun Forte compiler 7.1 on Sun Fire V880 UltraSPARC III Cu 8 processors server.

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article Regarding Itanium:

**Topic and Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on the performance of the OSCAR multigrain parallelizing compiler on various SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing) servers. The primary goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the OSCAR compiler in achieving parallel execution of programs, specifically targeting different server architectures and comparing its performance against existing commercial compilers.  

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article doesn't directly express explicit opinions about Itanium processors. It focuses on presenting performance data and comparisons across various architectures, including Itanium-based servers like the SGI Altix 3700 and NEC TX7/i6010. However, the performance figures for the OSCAR compiler on Itanium platforms are noticeably lower than those on other architectures, such as the IBM pSeries 690. 

Specifically, the OSCAR compiler achieves a 2.6 times speedup on the SGI Altix 3700 compared to Intel Fortran Itanium Compiler 7.1, and a 1.7 times speedup on the NEC TX7/i6010 compared to NEC Fortran Itanium Compiler 3.4. This contrasts with the 5.7 times speedup achieved on the IBM pSeries 690.

**Conclusion:**

While the article does not directly criticize Itanium, the performance figures suggest a potential disadvantage of the OSCAR compiler on Itanium systems compared to other architectures. The lower speedup achieved on Itanium-based servers, compared to the IBM pSeries 690, might indirectly indicate a possible performance limitation.

2005-01-01 - Pin: Building customized program analysis tools with dynamic instrumentation

Article:
Robust and powerful software instrumentation tools are essential for program analysis tasks such as profiling, performance evaluation, and bug detection. To meet this need, we have developed a new instrumentation system called Pin. Our goals are to provide easy-to-use, portable, transparent, and efficient instrumentation. Instrumentation tools (called Pintools) are written in C/C++ using Pin's rich API. Pin follows the model of ATOM, allowing the tool writer to analyze an application at the instruction level with-out the need for detailed knowledge of the underlying instruction set. The API is designed to be architecture independent whenever possible, making Pintools source compatible across different architectures. However, a Pintool can access architecture-specific details when necessary. Instrumentation with Pin is mostly transparent as the application and Pintool observe the application's original, uninstrumented behavior. Pin uses dynamic compilation to instrument executables while they are running. For efficiency, Pin uses several techniques, including inlining, register re-allocation, liveness analysis, and instruction scheduling to optimize instrumentation. This fully automated approach delivers significantly better instrumentation performance than similar tools. For example, Pin is 3.3x faster than Valgrind and 2x faster than DynamoRIO for basic-block counting. To illustrate Pin's versatility, we describe two Pintools in daily use to analyze production software. Pin is publicly available for Linux platforms on four architectures: IA32 (32-bit x86), EM64T (64-bit x86), Itanium, and ARM. In the ten months since Pin 2 was released in July 2004, there have been over 3000 downloads from its website. Copyright 2005 ACM. .

2005-01-01 - Practical compiler techniques on efficient multithreaded code generation for OpenMP programs

Article:
State-of-the-art multiprocessor systems pose several difficulties: (i) the user has to parallelize the existing serial code; (ii) explicitly threaded programs using a thread library are not portable; (iii) writing efficient multi-threaded programs requires intimate knowledge of machine's architecture and micro-architecture. Thus, well-tuned parallelizing compilers are in high demand to leverage state-of-the-art computer advances of NUMA-based multiprocessors, simultaneous multi-threading processors and chip-multiprocessor systems in response to the performance quest from the high-performance computing community. On the other hand, OpenMP* has emerged as the industry standard parallel programming model. Applications can be parallelized using OpenMP with less effort in a way that is portable across a wide range of multiprocessor systems. In this paper, we present several practical compiler optimization techniques and discuss their effect on the performance of OpenMP programs. We elaborate on the major design considerations in a high performance OpenMP compiler and present experimental data based on the implementation of the optimizations in the Intel C++ and Fortran compilers. Interactions of the OpenMP transformation with other sequential optimizations in the compiler are discussed. The techniques in this paper have achieved significant performance improvements on the industry standard SPEC* OMPM2001 and SPEC* OMPL2001 benchmarks, and these performance results are presented for Intel Pentium and Itanium processor based systems.

2005-01-01 - RAxML-OMP: An efficient program for phylogenetic inference on SMPs

Article:
Inference of phylogenetic trees comprising hundreds or even thousands of organisms based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method is computationally extremely intensive. In order to accelerate computations we implemented RAxML-OMP, an efficient OpenMP-parallelization for Symmetric Multi-Processing machines (SMPs) based on the sequential program RAxML-V (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood). RAxML-V is a program for inference of evolutionary trees based upon the ML method and incorporates several advanced search algorithms like fast hill-climbing and simulated annealing. We assess performance of RAxML-OMP on the widely used Intel Xeon, Intel Itanium, and AMD Opteron architectures. RAxML-OMP scales particularly well on the AMD Opteron architecture and achieves even super-linear speedups for large datasets (with a length  5.000 base pairs) due to improved cache-efficiency and data locality. RAxML-OMP is freely available as open source code.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005. .

2005-01-01 - Register allocation for software pipelined multi-dimensional loops

Article:
Software pipelining of a multi-dimensional loop is an important optimization that overlaps the execution of successive outermost loop iterations to explore instruction-level parallelism from the entire n-dimensional iteration space. This paper investigates register allocation for software pipelined multi-dimensional loops. For single loop software pipelining, the lifetime instances of a loop variant in successive iterations of the loop form a repetitive pattern. An effective register allocation method is to represent the pattern as a vector of lifetimes (or a vector lifetime using Rau's terminology) and map it to rotating registers. Unfortunately, the software pipelined schedule of a multi-dimensional loop is considerably more complex, and so are the vector lifetimes in it. In this paper, we develop a way to normalize and represent vector lifetimes in multi-dimensional loop software pipelining, which capture their complexity, while exposing their regularity that enables us to develop a simple, yet powerful solution. Our algorithm is based on the development of a metric, called distance, that quantitatively determines the degree of potential overlapping (conflicts) between two vector lifetimes. We show how to calculate and use the distance, conservatively or aggressively, to guide the register allocation of the vector lifetimes under a bin-packing algorithm framework. The classical register allocation for software pipelined single loops is subsumed by our method as a special case. The method has been implemented in the ORC compiler and produced code for the Itanium architecture. We report the effectiveness of our method on 134 loop nests with 348 loop levels. Several strategies for register allocation are compared and analyzed. Copyright 2005 ACM. .

The article focuses on the optimization technique known as "software pipelining" for multi-dimensional loops, which aims to improve performance by overlapping the execution of successive iterations. The core contribution of the paper lies in developing a new approach for register allocation in this specific context. This approach involves representing the lifetimes of variables within the software pipelined loop as "vector lifetimes" and utilizing a metric called "distance" to guide the allocation of these lifetimes to registers. The algorithm is then framed within a bin-packing algorithm framework.

**Sentiment Towards Itanium:**

The article mentions Itanium in a single sentence: "The method has been implemented in the ORC compiler and produced code for the Itanium architecture." This statement implies that the developed register allocation technique has been practically applied to the Itanium architecture and is capable of generating code for it.  

However, the article does not provide any specific details or analysis of the performance or effectiveness of the technique on Itanium. It simply states that the method has been *implemented* and *produced code* for the architecture.

**Conclusion:**

While the article demonstrates the applicability of the proposed technique to the Itanium architecture, it does not provide any explicit positive or negative sentiment towards Itanium. The authors seem neutral in their description, focusing primarily on the technical details of the algorithm and its application.

2005-01-01 - Scalable massively parallel artificial neural networks

Article:
There is renewed interest in computational intelligence, due to advances in algorithms, neuroscience, and computer hardware. In addition there is enormous interest in autonomous vehicles (air, ground, and sea) and robotics, which need significant onboard intelligence. Work in this area could not only lead to better understanding of the human brain but also very useful engineering applications. The functioning of the human brain is not well understood, but enormous progress has been made in understanding it and, in particular, the neocortex. There are many reasons to develop models of the brain. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), one type of model, can be very effective for pattern recognition, function approximation, scientific classification, control, and the analysis of time series data. ANNs often use the back-propagation algorithm for training, and can require large training times especially for large networks, but there are many other types of ANNs. Once the network is trained for a particular problem, however, it can produce results in a very short time. Parallelization of ANNs could drastically reduce the training time. An object-oriented, massively-parallel ANN (Artificial Neural Network) software package SPANN (Scalable Parallel Artificial Neural Network) has been developed and is described here. MPI was used to parallelize the C++ code. Only the neurons on tlie edges of the domains were involved in communication, in order to reduce the communication costs and maintain scalability. The back-propagation algorithm was used to train the network. In preliminary tests, the software was used to identify character sets. The code correctly identified all the characters wlien adequate training was used in the network. The code was run on up to 500 Intel Itanium processors with 25,000 neurons and more than 2 billion neuron weights. Various comparisons in training time, forward propagation time, and error reduction were also made. .

2005-01-01 - SWIFT: Software implemented fault tolerance

Article:
To improve performance and reduce power, processor designers employ advances that shrink feature sizes, lower voltage levels, reduce noise margins, and increase clock rates. However, these advances make processors more susceptible to transient faults that can affect correctness. While reliable systems typically employ hardware techniques to address soft-errors, software techniques can provide a lower-cost and more flexible alternative. This paper presents a novel, software-only, transient-fault-detection technique, called SWIFT. SWIFT efficiently manages redundancy by reclaiming unused instruction-level resources present during the execution of most programs. SWIFT also provides a high level of protection and performance with an enhanced control-flow checking mechanism. We evaluate an implementation of SWIFT on an Itanium 2 which demonstrates exceptional fault coverage with a reasonable performance cost. Compared to the best known single-threaded approach utilizing an ECC memory system, SWIFT demonstrates a 51% average speedup. .

2005-01-01 - The Open Runtime Platform: A flexible high-performance managed runtime environment

Article:
The Open Runtime Platform (ORP) is a high-performance managed runtime environment (MRTE) that features exact generational garbage collection, fast thread synchronization, and multiple coexisting just-in-time compilers (JITs). ORP was designed for flexibility in order to support experiments in dynamic compilation, garbage collection, synchronization, and other technologies. It can be built to run either Java or Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) applications, to run under the Windows or Linux operating systems, and to run on the IA-32 or Itanium processor family (IPF) architectures. Achieving high performance in a MRTE presents many challenges, particularly when flexibility is a major goal. First, to enable the use of different garbage collectors and JITs, each component must be isolated from the rest of the environment through a well-defined software interface. Without careful attention, this isolation could easily harm performance. Second, MRTEs have correctness and safety requirements that traditional languages such as C++ lack. These requirements, including null pointer checks, array bounds checks, and type checks, impose additional runtime overhead. Finally, the dynamic nature of MRTEs makes some traditional compiler optimizations, such as devirtualization of method calls, more difficult to implement or more limited in applicability. To get full performanc, JITs and the core virtual machine (VM) must cooperate to reduce or eliminate (where possible) these MRTE-specific overheads. In this paper, we describe the structure of ORP in detail, paying particular attention to how it supports flexibility while preserving high performance. We describe the interfaces between the garbage collector, the JIT, and the core VM; how these interfaces enable multiple garbage collectors and JITs without sacrificing performance; and how they allow the JIT and the core VM to reduce or eliminate MRTE-specific performance issues.

2005-01-01 - Three algorithms for improving the effectiveness of software pipelining: Comparison and combination

Article:
Software pipelining is a loop scheduling technique that extracts instruction level parallelism by overlapping the execution of several consecutive iterations. One of its drawbacks is the high register requirements, which may lead to software pipelining failure due to insufficient static general registers in Itanium. This paper evaluates the register requirements of software-pipelined loops and presents three new methods for software pipelining loops that require more static general registers than those available in Itanium processor. They reduce register pressure by either reducing instructions in the loop body or allocating stacked non-rotating registers or rotating register in register stack to serve as static registers. These methods are better than the existing techniques in that they further improve performance gain from software pipelining by increasing software-pipelined loops. These methods have been implemented in open research compiler (ORC) targeted for Itanium processor, and they perform well on loops of the programs in NAS Benchmarks. For some benchmarks, the performance is improved by more than 21%. .

2005-01-01 - Unpredication, unscheduling, unspeculation: Reverse engineering itanium executables

Article:
EPIC(Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) architectures, exemplified by the Intel Itanium, support a number of advanced architectural features, such as explicit instruction-level parallelism, instruction predication, and speculative loads from memory. However, compiler optimizations that take advantage of these features can profoundly restructure the program's code, making it potentially difficult to reconstruct the original program logic from an optimized Itanium executable. This paper describes techniques to undo some of the effects of such optimizations and thereby improve the quality of reverse engineering such executables.  2005 IEEE. .

Response:
## Analyzing the Sentiment of the Article:

This article focuses on the challenges of reverse engineering optimized Itanium executables. The authors highlight the advanced features of the Itanium architecture, particularly:

* **Explicit instruction-level parallelism:** The Itanium allows for a more direct control of parallel instructions, potentially leading to optimized performance.
* **Instruction predication:** The Itanium can conditionally execute instructions based on a predicate, offering flexibility in program execution.
* **Speculative loads from memory:** The Itanium can load data from memory speculatively, potentially speeding up execution if the data is needed.

The core issue the article addresses is that these features, while powerful, also make it harder to reverse engineer the original program logic. The compiler optimizations heavily restructure the code, obscuring the original intent. This makes it difficult for security researchers, reverse engineers, or even developers to understand the underlying logic of the program.

**Sentiment Towards Itanium:**

While the article acknowledges the advanced features of the Itanium architecture, its primary focus is on the **negative implications** of these features for reverse engineering. The authors don't explicitly criticize Itanium, but the very existence of the article implies a **concern** with the complexity introduced by these features. This complexity makes it harder to understand the program's functionality, raising potential issues for security analysis, code maintenance, and debugging.

**Sentiment Score:**

Given the focus on the challenges associated with Itanium's advanced features and their impact on reverse engineering, the article displays a **slight negative sentiment** towards the architecture.

Variable frequency clocks support a power management scheme which maximizes processor performance within a configured power envelope. Core supply voltage and clock frequency are modulated dynamically in order to remain within the power envelope. The Foxton controller and dynamically-variable clock system reside on die while the variable voltage regulator and power measurement resistors reside off chip. In addition, high-bandwidth frequency adjustment allows the clock period to adapt during on-die supply transients, allowing higher frequency processor operation during transients than possible with a single-frequency clock system. .

2006-01-01 - A Lifetime Optimal Algorithm for Speculative PRE

Article:
A lifetime optimal algorithm, called MC-PRE, is presented for the first time that performs speculative PRE based on edge profiles. In addition to being computationally optimal in the sense that the total number of dynamic computations for an expression in the transformed code is minimized, MC-PRE is also lifetime optimal since the lifetimes of introduced temporaries are also minimized. The key in achieving lifetime optimality lies not only in finding a unique minimum cut on a transformed graph of a given CFG, but also in performing a data-flow analysis directly on the CFG to avoid making unnecessary code insertions and deletions. The lifetime optimal results are rigorously proved. We evaluate our algorithm in GCC against three previously published PRE algorithms, namely,MC-PREcomp (Qiong and Xues computationally optimal version of MC-PRE), LCM (Knoop, R uthing, and Steffens lifetime optimal algorithm for performing nonspeculative classic PRE), and CMP-PRE (Bodik, Gupta, and Soffas PRE algorithm based on code-motion preventing (CMP) regions, which is speculative but not computationally optimal). We report and analyze our experimental results, obtained from both actual program execution and instrumentation, for all 22 C, C++ and FORTRAN 77 benchmarks from SPECcpu2000 on an Itanium 2 computer system. Our results show that MC-PRE (or MC-PREcomp) is capable of eliminating more partial redundancies than both LCM and CMP-PRE (especially in functions with complex control flow), and, in addition, MC-PRE inserts temporaries with shorter lifetimes than MC-PREcomp. Each of both benefits has contributed to the performance improvements in benchmark programs at the costs of only small compile-time and code-size increases in some benchmarks.  2006, ACM.

Article:
This paper reports on the status of the GNU Modula-2 front end to GCC and the extensions made to Modula-2 and gdb to ease its potential integration into the main GCC source tree. GNU Modula-2 (gm2) is maturing into a reliable tool and it now builds and passes its regression tests on the following platforms: x86, Opteron, Athlon 64, Alpha, Itanium processors running GNU/Linux, Sparc based Solaris, PowerPC MacOS, x86 Open Darwin and the x86 processor running FreeBSD. GNU Modula-2 currently conforms to all three Programming in Modula-2 dialects as defined by Wirth. The paper also describes the two categories of language extensions made. The first category follows the tradition of other GCC front ends by allowing the in-lining of assembly language, conditional compilation, procedure in-lining and allowing users to cleanly exploit the GCC library of built-in functions and constants. The second category provide easy access to C libraries. The work presented here discusses the portable implementation of open arrays, module priorities, coroutine primitives and multi-word sets. It also reports on many of the key design decisions taken during the construction of GNU Modula-2 and their various implications. .

The register stack (RS) is a major component of the Explicit Parallel Instruction Computer (EPIC) architecture. In this paper, our objective is to close the theoretical performance gap between EPIC and stack processors running virtual stack machines - using Forth, a simple and canonical stack machine. For this purpose, we first introduce a new calling mechanism using the RS to implement a software-only virtual stack machine. Based upon our performance measurements, we show that the new calling mechanism is a promising technique to improve the performance of stack-based interpretative virtual machines. But limitation in EPIC makes the need for hardware support to reach optimal performance. As a second step, we define an addition to Itanium 2 processor's instruction set to accommodate the new calling mechanism. As our third and last step, we describe a conservative architectural implementation of the extended instruction set.  2006 IEEE. .

2006-01-01 - An efficient memory operations optimization technique for vector loops on Itanium 2 processors

Article:
To keep up with a large degree of instruction level parallelism (ILP), the Itanium 2 cache systems use a complex organization scheme: load/store queues, banking and interleaving. In this paper, we study the impact of these cache systems on memory instructions scheduling. We demonstrate that, if no care is taken at compile time, the non-precise memory disambiguation mechanism and the banking structure cause severe performance loss, even for very simple regular codes. We also show that grouping the memory operations in a pseudo-vectorized way enables the compiler to generate more effective code for the Itanium 2 processor. The impact of this code optimization technique on register pressure is analyzed for various valorization schemes. Copyright  2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. .

2006-01-01 - Analysis and characterization of Intel Itanium instruction bundles for improving VLIW processor performance

Article:
In order to achieve high instruction level parallelism (ILP), designers are turning to very long instruction word (VLIW) based designs, in which different types of instructions are grouped together as bundles of 128 bits or longer. In VLIW, the added nops increase the code size, limit processor performance by the wider-utilization of functional units. In examining these performance issues of VLIW systems, we consider Intel first 64-bit architecture, the IA-64, and its first implementation, the Itanium, which employs Intel version of VLIW. We present a comprehensive analysis of the problem of wider-utilization due to nops and stops across a wide range of application domains through the use of three different benchmark suites: SPEC CPU 2000, MediaBench, and PacketBench. Our results show that, on average, nops create an under-utilization factor of 28.46% in the case of SPEC CPU. 32.27% in MediaBench, and 29.76% in PacketBench. We also analyze the characteristics of different instruction bundle formats, which we obtain by collecting statistics concerning the frequency of the bundle formats.  2006 IEEE. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article:

**Topic/Goal:**

The article primarily focuses on analyzing the performance issues of Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processors, specifically targeting the Intel Itanium architecture. The goal is to understand the impact of "nops" (no-operation instructions) and "stops" on performance, with a particular interest in their impact on code size and functional unit utilization. To achieve this, the authors conduct an extensive analysis using three benchmark suites, providing insights into the frequency of different instruction bundle formats.

**Sentiment Towards Itanium:**

While the article doesn't explicitly praise Itanium, it doesn't outright condemn it either. The authors clearly acknowledge the potential of VLIW designs for achieving high Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP).  However, they dedicate significant effort to highlighting the challenges associated with these designs, particularly the issue of "nops" and their negative impact on performance. 

This focus on the limitations of Itanium's VLIW implementation could be interpreted as mildly critical. The article doesn't offer solutions or suggest alternative approaches, but rather focuses on documenting and quantifying the challenges. 

**Sentiment Score:**

Considering the emphasis on the drawbacks of the Itanium's VLIW implementation, the article leans towards a **slightly negative sentiment**. However, it doesn't explicitly denounce Itanium, and the analysis itself contributes to a better understanding of its limitations.

**Final Sentiment Score: [-1]**

2006-01-01 - Application of LADA for post-silicon test content and diagnostic tool validation

Article:
Embedded cache size has dramatically increased with the advent of Intel Hyper-Threading and Multi-Core Technology, making many of the existing cache test validation method less and less practical, if not obsolete. As a result, the effort to sustain and improve array test quality, which is ever so critical to achieve DPM goals, is becoming a formidable challenge. In this paper, we present a test content validation procedure through novel application of Laser Assisted Device Alteration (LADA), i.e. soft fault injection in state elements, which had proven itself in Itanium 2 array test quality improvement. While the procedure was originally targeting cache test content, the underlying concept has been successfully deployed to expedite scan test content and fault isolation tool validation.

2006-01-01 - Beating in-order stalls with "Flea-Flicker" two-pass pipelining

Article:
While compilers have generally proven adept at planning useful static instruction-level parallelism for in-order microarchitectures, the efficient accommodation of unanticipable latencies, like those of load instructions, remains a vexing problem. Traditional out-of-order execution hides some of these latencies, but repeats scheduling work already done by the compiler and adds additional pipeline overhead. Other techniques, such as prefetching and multithreading, can hide some anticipable, long-latency misses, but not the shorter, more diffuse stalls due to difficult-to-anticipate, first or second-level misses. Our work proposes a microarchitectural technique, two-pass pipelining, whereby the program executes on two in-order back-end pipelines coupled by a queue. The "advance" pipeline often defers instructions dispatching with unready operands rather than stalling. The "backup" pipeline allows concurrent resolution of instructions deferred by the first pipeline allowing overlapping of useful "advanced" execution with miss resolution. An accompanying compiler technique and instruction marking further enhance the handling of miss latencies. Applying our technique to an Itanium 2-like design achieves a speedup of 1.38x in mcf, the most memory-intensive SPECint2000 benchmark, and an average of 1.12x across other selected benchmarks, yielding between 32 percent and 67 percent of an idealized out-of-order design's speedup at a much lower design cost and complexity.  2006 IEEE. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

This article focuses on addressing the issue of in-order stalls caused by memory load instructions in modern processors. The authors introduce a new microarchitectural technique called "two-pass pipelining" as a solution to this problem. This technique aims to improve performance by overlapping execution with the resolution of memory misses, thus reducing the impact of memory latency on overall execution speed. The article compares the effectiveness of their proposed technique to traditional out-of-order execution and prefetching, highlighting its potential to achieve significant speedups while maintaining a lower design cost and complexity. 

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

While the article doesn't explicitly discuss Itanium's advantages or disadvantages, it does use it as a benchmark platform to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed technique. The authors implement two-pass pipelining on an "Itanium 2-like design" and report performance improvements on a suite of benchmarks, including the memory-intensive SPECint2000 benchmark *mcf*. The article specifically mentions that the technique achieves a speedup of 1.38x in *mcf* and an average speedup of 1.12x across other benchmarks. This positive performance data suggests that the authors view the Itanium 2 architecture as a suitable platform for testing and demonstrating the benefits of their proposed technique. 

**Sentiment Score:**

Based on the article's use of Itanium as a benchmark platform and the positive performance results reported, the overall sentiment towards Itanium can be categorized as **[1] - Somewhat positive**. 

**Conclusion:**

The article primarily focuses on the effectiveness of the proposed two-pass pipelining technique, but its use of Itanium as a test platform and the positive performance results achieved indirectly suggest a supportive stance towards the architecture. While not explicitly praising Itanium, the article does not present any negative information about the architecture and instead highlights its suitability for demonstrating the benefits of the proposed technique.

The framework is used to provide an exact description of the computations of (a subset of) the Itanium instruction set on an Itanium multiprocessor architecture. We show that capturing register and control dependencies is crucial: a producer/consumer problem is solvable without using strong synchronization primitives on Itanium multiprocessors, but is impossible without exploiting these dependencies.

## Analysis of Sentiment towards Itanium

The article focuses on developing a comprehensive framework for modeling memory consistency, incorporating register and control dependencies. This framework is then applied to analyze the computational behavior of a subset of Itanium's instruction set within a multiprocessor architecture.

The authors highlight the significance of capturing register and control dependencies by demonstrating a specific example: a producer/consumer problem that can be solved on Itanium without strong synchronization primitives, but would be impossible without exploiting these dependencies. This implies that the framework, which includes these dependencies, is crucial for understanding Itanium's computational capabilities. 

While the article doesn't explicitly praise Itanium, the inclusion of Itanium as a case study and the emphasis on the framework's ability to capture crucial dependencies can be interpreted as a positive aspect. The authors are actively exploring and demonstrating the intricacies of Itanium's architecture, showcasing its capabilities in handling complex scenarios like the producer/consumer problem. 

**Sentiment Score:**  [1] - Somewhat positive. 

**Explanation:** Although the article's primary focus is on the framework itself, the choice of Itanium as a case study and the positive implications of the framework's ability to capture dependencies suggest a somewhat positive sentiment towards the architecture.

2006-01-01 - Customizing the redesignation process for individual platform interrupts on a soft-partitioned system

Article:
This disclosure relates to the field of operating systems. A technique is disclosed that allows the redesignation process that changes the designated partition on a soft-partitioned system to take actions that are specific to a particular platform interrupt source. A soft-partitioning product supports running multiple operating system instances in individual soft-partitions on a single, physical server The configuration and management of the individual soft-partitions is done by a soft-partition monitor that, on some platforms such as Itanium platforms, runs in an administrative soft-partition and launches individual soft partitions with support from firmware. On such a system, multiple operating system instances will share platform interrupt sources. The soft-partition monitor will allow only one operating system instance (denoted as the designated OS) to program the interrupt controller for a particular platform interrupt source. The designated OS will then handle all the hardware interrupts from that source The soft-partition monitor will manage all the book-keeping associated with tracking which OS instance is handling which interrupt source, and will forward interrupts to the appropriate soft-partition instances for handling by the associated driver's interrupt service routine. When the designated partition on a soft-partitioned system is no longer capable of handling interrupts (due to, for example, a crash, a reboot, a system shutdown, etc.), a new designated partition is chosen via a process known as redesignation According to the present disclosure, the redesignation process is coordinated by the soft-partition monitor. During redesignation, there may be specific tasks associated with each platform interrupt source that need to be performed by the soft-partition monitor. For example, one platform interrupt may require that the interrupt hardware be reset, while another may require certain corrective action specific to the interrupt source To implement this in the soft-partition monitor's redesignation code, each platform interrupt source is associated with a function pointer handle which is invoked when redesignation occurs The function pointer handle is provided to the soft-partition monitor by the interrupt handling subsystem associated with the platform interrupt source. When a redesignation event occurs for a particular interrupt source, the function pointer is used by the soft-partition monitor to invoke the corresponding interrupt handling subsystem In this manner, each platform interrupt source can manage its own specific redesignation-related tasks. As understood with reference to the Figure, in a method 1 of the present disclosure a soft-partition monitor is provided 2 A function handle pointer is associated 3 with each platform interrupt source After a redesignation event occurs 4, the soft-partition monitor invokes 5 the corresponding interrupt handling subsystem via the function pointer handle. Such a technique eliminates the need to provide extra platform interrupt controller hardware to support fine grained partitioning, and enables individual soft partitions to react to platform interrupts similarly to a regular physical server. .

## Analyzing the Sentiment Towards Itanium

The article focuses on Intel's overall business prospects, specifically addressing the company's need to streamline operations and focus on its core strengths. This is achieved by:

* **Highlighting the strength of Intel's traditional X86 computing business:** This implicitly positions X86 as the key to Intel's future success, setting the stage for a contrast with other business segments. 
* **Discussing the underperformance of Intel's communications business:** This emphasizes the need for change and highlights the burden of loss-making segments.
* **Mentioning the potential sale or spin-off of the flash unit and the eventual replacement of Itanium with multithreaded X86 CPUs:** This directly suggests that Itanium is not a part of Intel's long-term vision and is being actively considered for replacement. 

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article consistently frames Itanium as a liability. While it doesn't explicitly attack Itanium, the suggestions to "transition out" and replace it with X86 processors clearly indicate a lack of faith in its future.  The focus on streamlining operations and shedding non-core businesses further reinforces this sentiment.

**Conclusion:** 

The article presents a predominantly negative view of Itanium, positioning it as a problematic segment in need of replacement.  Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium is **[-1] - Signs of critique**.

2006-01-01 - Efficiently implementing a large number of LL/SC objects

Article:
Over the past decade, a pair of instructions called load-linked (LL) and store-conditional (SC) have emerged as the most suitable synchronization instructions for the design of lock-free algorithms. However, current architectures do not support these instructions; instead, they support either CAS (e.g., UltraSPARC, Itanium) or restricted versions of LL/SC (e.g., POWER4, MIPS, Alpha). Thus, there is a gap between what algorithm designers want (namely, LL/SC) and what multiprocessors actually support (namely, CAS or RLL/RSC). To bridge this gap, a flurry of algorithms that implement LL/SC from CAS have appeared in the literature. The two most recent algorithms are due to Doherty, Herlihy, Luchangco, and Moir (2004) and Michael (2004). To implement M LL/SC objects shared by N processes, Doherty et al.'s algorithm uses only 0(N + M) space, but is only non-blocking and not wait-free. Michael's algorithm, on the other hand, is wait-free, but uses O(N2 + M) space. The main drawback of his algorithm is the time complexity of the SC operation: although the expected amortized running time of SC is only O(1), the worst-case running time of SC is O(N2). The algorithm in this paper overcomes this drawback. Specifically, we design a waitfree algorithm that achieves a space complexity of O(N2 + M), while still maintaining the O(1) worst-case running time for LL and SC operations.

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article Regarding Itanium

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on the implementation of load-linked (LL) and store-conditional (SC) instructions, which are essential for lock-free algorithms. The authors acknowledge that while these instructions are highly desirable for algorithm design, contemporary architectures lack full support for them. Instead, they provide either CAS (Compare and Swap) instructions (like UltraSPARC and Itanium) or restricted versions of LL/SC (like POWER4, MIPS, and Alpha). The article's primary goal is to present a new algorithm that effectively implements LL/SC from CAS, overcoming the shortcomings of previous algorithms in terms of space and time complexity.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article mentions Itanium as an example of an architecture that supports CAS instead of LL/SC. This mention is purely factual and does not express any opinion about Itanium's capabilities or limitations. It is simply used to illustrate the disparity between the desired functionality (LL/SC) and what existing architectures offer (CAS or restricted LL/SC). 

**Conclusion:**

The article does not express any positive or negative sentiment towards Itanium. It simply uses Itanium as an example of a processor architecture with CAS support, acknowledging that this architecture does not fully meet the requirements of the discussed algorithms.

The aim of this paper is to show that the recently developed high performance divide and conquer algorithm for solving linear recurrence systems with constant coefficients together with the new BLAS-based algorithm for narrow-banded triangular Toeplitz matrix-vector multiplication, allow to evaluate linear recursive filters efficiently on distributed memory parallel computers. We apply the BSP model of parallel computing to predict the behaviour of the algorithm and to find the optimal values of the method's parameters. The results of experiments performed on a cluster of twelve dual-processor Itanium 2 computers and Cray X1 are also presented and discussed. The algorithm allows to utilize up to 30% of the peak performance of 24 Itanium processors, while a simple scalar algorithm can only utilize about 4% of the peak performance of a single processor.

Total order broadcast is a fundamental communication primitive that plays a central role in bringing cheap software-based high availability to a wide array of services. This paper studies the practical performance of such a primitive on a cluster of homogeneous machines. We present FSR, a (uniform) total order broadcast protocol that provides high throughput, regardless of message broadcast patterns. FSR is based on a ring topology, only relies on point-to-point inter-process communication, and has a linear latency with respect to the total number of processes in the system. Moreover, it is fair in the sense that each process has an equal opportunity of having its messages delivered by all processes. On a cluster of Itanium based machines, FSR achieves a throughput of 79 Mbit/s on a 100 Mbit/s switched Ethernet network.  2006 IEEE. .

2006-01-01 - Implicit and explicit optimizations for stencil computations

Article:
Stencil-based kernels constitute the core of many scientific applications on block-structured grids. Unfortunately, these codes achieve a low fraction of peak performance, due primarily to the disparity between processor and main memory speeds. We examine several optimizations on both the conventional cache-based memory systems of the Itanium 2, Opteron, and Power5, as well as the heterogeneous multicore design of the Cell processor. The optimizations target cache reuse across stencil sweeps, including both an implicit cache oblivious approach and a cache-aware algorithm blocked to match the cache structure. Finally, we consider stencil computations on a machine with an explicitly-managed memory hierarchy, the Cell processor. Overall, results show that a cache-aware approach is significantly faster than a cache oblivious approach and that the explicitly managed memory on Cell is more efficient: Relative to the Power5, it has almost 2x more memory bandwidth and is 3.7x faster.

2006-01-01 - Improved Superblock optimization in GCC

Article:
Superblock scheduling is a common technique to increase the level of instruction level parallelism (ILP) in generated code. Compared to a basic block, the Superblock gives an optimizer or scheduler a longer range over which instructions can be moved. The bookkeeping necessary to execute that move is less than would be necessary inside an arbitrary trace region. Additionally, the process of forming Superblocks generates more instructions that are eligible for movement. These factors combine to produce a significant increase in the ILP in a section of code. By identifying the key feature of Superblock formation that allows this increase in ILP, we can generalize the concept to describe a class of similar optimizations. We refer to techniques in this class as structural techniques. Combining several optimizations in this class with aggressive classical optimization has been shown in the OpenIMPACT compiler to be particularly useful in developing ILP when compiling for the Itanium processor. As a motivation for our work, we present an investigation into the value of structural compilation in the OpenIMPACT compiler. In this domain, structural techniques have been credited with a 10% to 13% increase in code performance over a compiler that implements only classical optimizations. As a first step toward developing structural compilation techniques in GCC, we implemented Superblock formation at the Tree-SSA level. By performing structural transformations early, we give the compiler's high level optimizers an opportunity to specialize the transformed program, thereby cultivating higher levels of ILP. The early results of this modification are mixed, with some benchmarks improving and others slowing. In this paper, we present details on our implementation and study the effects of this structural transformation on later optimizations. Through this, we hope to motivate future work to implement and improve optimizations that can take advantage of the transformed control flow. .

Article:
Several different techniques and softwares intend to improve the accuracy of results computed in a fixed finite precision. Here we focus on a method to improve the accuracy of the polynomial evaluation. It is well known that the use of the Fused Multiply and Add operation available on some microprocessors like Intel Itanium improves slightly the accuracy of the Horner scheme. In this paper, we propose an accurate compensated Horner scheme specially designed to take advantage of the Fused Multiply and Add. We prove that the computed result is as accurate as if computed in twice the working precision. The algorithm we present is fast since it only requires well optimizable floating point operations, performed in the same working precision as the given data. Copyright 2006 ACM. .

2006-01-01 - Inline analysis: Beyond selection heuristics

Article:
Research on procedure inlining has mainly focused on heuristics that decide whether inlining a particular call-site maximizes application performance. However, other equally important aspects of inline analysis such as call-site analysis order, indirect effects of inlining, and selection of the most profitable version of a procedure warrant more attention. This paper evaluates a number of different sequences in which call-sites are examined for inlining and shows that choosing the correct order is crucial to obtaining the best run-time performance. We then present a novel, work-list-based, and updated sequence that achieves the best results. While applying cross-module inline analysis on large applications with thousands of files and millions of lines of code, we separate the analysis from the transformation phase and allow the former to work solely on summary information in order to reduce compile-time and memory consumption. A focus of this paper is to enumerate the summaries that our compiler maintains, present a technique to compute the goodness factor on which the work-list sequence is based, and describe methods to continuously update the summaries as and when a call-site is accepted for inlining. We then introduce inline specialization, a new technique that facilitates inlining into call chains selectively. The power of inline specialization lies in its ability to choose the most profitable version of the called procedure without having to maintain multiple versions at any point of time. We discuss implementation of these techniques in the HPUX Itanium production compiler and present experimental results showing that a dynamic work-list based analysis order, comprehensive summary updates, and inline specialization significantly improve performance of applications.  2006 IEEE. .

2006-01-01 - Issues and support for dynamic register allocation

Article:
Post-link and dynamic optimizations have become important to achieve program performance. A major challenge in post-link and dynamic optimizations is the acquisition of registers for inserting optimization code in the main program. It is difficult to achieve both correctness and transparency when software-only schemes for acquiring registers are used, as described in [1]. We propose an architecture feature that builds upon existing hardware for stacked register allocation on the Itanium processor. The hardware impact of this feature is minimal, while simultaneously allowing post-link and dynamic optimization systems to obtain registers for optimization in a "safe" manner, thus preserving the transparency and improving the performance of these systems.

2006-01-01 - Multi-language programming: The challenge and promise of class-level interfacing

Article:
Many computer applications today involve modules written in different programming languages, and integrating these modules together is a delicate operation. This first requires the availability of formalisms to let programmers denote "foreign" entities like objects and subprograms as well as their associated types. Then, proper translation of what programmers express often calls for significant implementation effort, possibly down to the specification of very precise ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces). Meta-language based approaches ala CORBA/IDL are very powerful in this respect but typically aim at addressing distributed systems issues as well, hence entail support infrastructure that not every target environment needs or can afford. When component distribution over a network is not a concern, straight interfacing at the binary object level is much more efficient. It however relies on numerous low level details and in practice is most often only possible for a limited set of constructs. Binary level interaction between foreign modules is traditionally achieved through subprogram calls, exchanging simple data types and relying on the target environment's core ABI. Object Oriented features in modern languages motivate specific additional capabilities in this area, such as class-level interfacing to allow reuse and extension of class hierarchies across languages with minimal constraints. This paper describes work we have conducted in this context, allowing direct binding of Ada extensible tagged types with C++ classes. Motivated by extensions to the Ada typing system made as part of the very recent language standard revision, this work leverages the GCC multilanguage infrastructure and implementation of the Itanium C++ ABI. We will first survey the issues and mechanisms related to basic interlanguage operations, then present the interfacing challenges posed by modern object oriented features after a brief overview of the Ada, C++, and Java object models. We will continue with a description of our work on Ada/C++ classlevel interfacing facilities, illustrated by an example. .

We propose an evolutionary algorithm (EA) that applies to the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The EA uses edge assembly crossover (EAX), which is known to be efficient and effective for solving TSPs. Recently, a fast implementation of EAX and an effective technique for preserving population diversity were proposed. This makes it possible to compare the EA with EAX comparable to state-of-the-art TSP heuristics based on Lin-Karnighan heuristics. We further improved the performance of EAs with EAX, especially for large instances of more than 10,000 cities. Our method can find optimal solutions for instances of up to 24978 cities within a day using a single Itanium 2 1.3-GHz processor. Moreover, our EA found three new best tours for unsolved national TSP instances in a reasonable computation time.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006. .

This report presents a comprehensive survey of the effect of different data layouts on the single processor performance characteristics for the lattice Boltzmann method both for commodity "off-the-shelf" (COTS) architectures and tailored HPC systems, such as vector computers. We cover modern 64-bit processors ranging from IA32 compatible (Intel Xeon/Nocona, AMD Opteron), superscalar RISC (IBM Power4), IA64 (Intel Itanium 2) to classical vector (NEC SX6+) and novel vector (Cray X1) architectures. Combining different data layouts with architecture dependent optimization strategies we demonstrate that the optimal implementation strongly depends on the architecture used. In particular, the correct choice of the data layout could supersede complex cache-blocking techniques in our kernels. Furthermore our results demonstrate that vector systems can outperform COTS architectures by one order of magnitude.  2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. .

2006-01-01 - Optimal register reassignment for register stack overflow minimization

Article:
Architectures with a register stack can implement efficient calling conventions. Using the overlapping of callers and callees registers, callers are able to pass parameters to callees without a memory stack. The most recent instance of a register stack can be found in the Intel Itanium architecture. A hardware component called the register stack engine (RSE) provides an illusion of an infinite-length register stack using a memory-backed process to handle overflow and underflow for a physically limited number of registers. Despite such hardware support, some applications suffer from the overhead required to handle register stack overflow and underflow. The memory latency associated with the overflow and underflow of a register stack can be reduced by generating multiple register allocation instructions within a procedure [Settle et al. 2003]. Live analysis is utilized to find a set of registers that are not required to keep their values across procedure boundaries. However, among those dead registers, only the registers that are consecutively located in a certain part of the register stack frame can be removed. We propose a compiler-supported register reassignment technique that reduces RSE overflow/underflow further. By reassigning registers based on live analysis, our technique forces as many dead registers to be removed as possible. We define the problem of optimal register reassignment, which minimizes interprocedural register stack heights considering multiple call sites within a procedure.

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article

The article focuses on optimizing register allocation in architectures featuring a register stack, specifically targeting the Intel Itanium architecture. The primary goal is to mitigate the performance overhead associated with register stack overflow and underflow, which can occur when the physical register space is insufficient.

The article acknowledges the existence of a hardware component called the Register Stack Engine (RSE) in Itanium, which aims to alleviate this issue by using memory as a backing store for the register stack. However, the authors highlight that despite this hardware support, certain applications still suffer from the latency incurred during overflow and underflow events.

To address this, the article proposes a compiler-based register reassignment technique. The core idea is to leverage live analysis to identify dead registers (registers whose values are not needed across procedure boundaries) and strategically reassign them within the register stack. This technique aims to minimize the number of registers requiring memory-based handling, thereby reducing the frequency and impact of overflow and underflow events.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

While the article acknowledges Itanium's register stack architecture and its associated hardware component (RSE), the overall sentiment is **critical** of this design choice. The authors highlight the performance drawbacks associated with register stack overflow and underflow, suggesting that the RSE's hardware solution is not entirely effective. The focus of the article lies in proposing a **compiler-based solution** to mitigate these issues, implying that the hardware solution is inadequate.

Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium can be categorized as:

**[-1] - Signs of critique (Sceptical of Itanium, or indirectly negative)**

2006-01-01 - Optimised external computation for the Euro50 MATLAB based integrated model

Article:
In previous work we have countered computational demands faced in integrated modelling by developing and using a parallel toolkit for MATLAB. However the use of an increasingly realistic model makes the computational requirements of the model much larger, particularly in wavefront sensing, reaching a point where simulations of several real time seconds were no longer practical taking up to 3 weeks per second. In response to this problem we have developed optimised C code to which MATLAB off loads computation. This code has numerous advantages over native MATLAB computation. It is portable, scaleable using OpenMP directives and can run remotely using Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). It has opened up the possibility of exploiting high end Itanium and Opteron based shared memory systems, optimised 3rd party libraries and aggressive compiler optimisation. These factors combined with hand-tuning give a performance increase of the order of 100 times. The interface to the rest of the model remains the same so the overall structure is unchanged. In addition we have developed a similar system based on Message Passing Interface version 2, (MPI-2) which allows us to exploited clusters. Here we present an analysis of techniques used and gains obtained along with a brief discussion of future work. .

2006-01-01 - Parallel simulation of three-dimensional bursting with MPI and OpenMP

Article:
This work presents a mathematical model and its parallel implementation via two parallel paradigms for the simulation of three-dimensional bursting phenomena. The mathematical model consists of four nonlinearly coupled partial differential equations and includes fast and slow subsystems. The differential equations have been discretized by means of a linearly-implicit finite difference method in equally-spaced grids. The resulting system of equations at each time level has been solved by means of an optimized Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method. The proposed mathematical model has been implemented via: (1) a message passing paradigm based on the standard MPI and (2) a shared address space paradigm based on SPMD OpenMP. The two implementations have been evaluated on two current parallel architectures, i.e., a cluster of biprocessors Xeon and an SGI Altix 3700 Bx2 based on Itanium. It is shown that better performance and scalability are obtained on the second platform.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006. .

2006-01-01 - Partial dead code elimination on predicated code regions

Article:
This paper presents the design, implementation and experimental evaluation of a practical region-based partial dead code elimination (PDE) algorithm on predicated code in the Open Research Compiler framework. Existing PDE algorithms are not applicable on predicated code due to the existence of if-converted branches in the program. The proposed algorithm processes all PDE candidates in a worklist and considers their partial deadness using predicate partition graphs. Our algorithm operates uniformly on individual hyperblocks as well as regions comprising of basic blocks and hyperblocks. The result of applying our algorithm to a single-entry multiple-exit (SEME) region is optimal: partially dead code cannot be removed without changing the branching structure of the program or potentially introducing new predicate defining instructions. We present statistical evidence about the PDE opportunities in the 17 SPEC95 and SPEC00 integer benchmarks. Our algorithm achieves performance improvements in 12 out of the 17 benchmarks on an Itanium machine at small compilation overheads. Our results indicate that our algorithm can be used as a practical pass before instruction scheduling. Copyright  2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. .

2006-01-01 - Performance modeling using Monte Carlo simulation

Article:
Cycle accurate simulation has long been the primary tool for micro-architecture design and evaluation. Though accurate, the slow speed often imposes constraints on the extent of design exploration. In this work, we propose a fast, accurate Monte-Carlo based model for predicting processor performance. We apply this technique to predict the CPI of in-order architectures and validate it against the Itanium-2. The Monte Carlo model uses micro-architecture independent application characteristics, and cache, branch predictor statistics to predict CPI with an average error of less than 7%. Since prediction is achieved in a few seconds, the model can be used for fast design space exploration that can efficiently cull the space for cycle-accurate simulations. Besides accurately predicting CPI, the model also breaks down CPI into various components, where each component quantifies the effect of a particular stall condition (branch mis-prediction, cache miss, etc.) on overall CPI. Such a CPI decomposition can help processor designers quickly identify and resolve critical performance bottlenecks. .

Sparse matrix computations arise in many scientific and engineering applications, but their performance is limited by the growing gap between processor and memory speed. In this paper, we present a case study of an important sparse matrix triple product problem that commonly arises in primal-dual optimization method. Instead of a generic two-phase algorithm, we devise and implement a single pass algorithm that exploits the block diagonal structure of the matrix. Our algorithm uses fewer floating point operations and roughly half the memory of the two-phase algorithm. The speed-up of the one-phase scheme over the two-phase scheme is 2.04 on a 900 MHz Intel Itanium-2, 1.63 on an 1 GHz Power-4, and 1.99 on a 900 MHz Sun Ultra-3.

2006-01-01 - Prematerialization: Reducing register pressure for free

Article:
Modern compiler transformations that eliminate redundant computations or reorder instructions, such as partial redundancy elimination and instruction scheduling, are very effective in improving application performance but tend to create longer and potentially more complex live ranges. Typically the task of dealing with the increased register pressure is left to the register allocator. To avoid introduction of spill code which can reduce or completely eliminate the benefit of earlier optimizations, researchers have developed techniques such as live range splitting and rematerialization. This paper describes prematerialization (PM), a novel method for reducing register pressure for VLIW architectures with nop instructions. PM and rematerialization both select "never killed" live ranges and break them up by introducing one or more definitions close to the uses. However, while rematerialization is applied to live ranges selected for spilling during register allocation, PM relies on the availability of nop instructions and occurs prior to register allocation. PM simplifies register allocation by creating live ranges that are easier to color and less likely to spill. We have implemented prematerialization in HP-UX production compilers for the Intel Itanium architecture. Performance evaluation indicates that the proposed technique is effective in reducing register pressure inherent in highly optimized code. Copyright 2006 ACM. .

2006-01-01 - Processing-in-memory technology for knowledge discovery algorithms

Article:
The goal of this work is to gain insight into whether processing-in-memory (PIM) technology can be used to accelerate the performance of link discovery algorithms, which represent an important class of emerging knowledge discovery techniques. PIM chips that integrate processor logic into memory devices offer a new opportunity for bridging the growing gap between processor and memory speeds, especially for applications with high memory-bandwidth requirements. As LD algorithms are data-intensive and highly parallel, involving read-only queries over large data sets, parallel computing power extremely close (physically) to the data has the potential of providing dramatic computing speedups. For this reason, we evaluated the mapping of LD algorithms to a processing-in-memory (PIM) workstation-class architecture, the DIVA / Godiva hardware testbeds developed by USC/ISI. Accounting for differences in clock speed and data scaling, our analysis shows a performance gain on a single PIM, with the potential for greater improvement when multiple PIMs are used. Measured speedups of 8x are shown on two additional bandwidth benchmarks, even though the Itanium-2 has a clock rate 6X faster. Copyright 2006 ACM. .

## Analyzing the Article's Sentiment Towards Itanium

The article focuses on exploring the potential of "processing-in-memory" (PIM) technology for accelerating link discovery algorithms. This specific type of algorithm is heavily reliant on data processing, requiring high memory bandwidth. The authors argue that PIM, with its close proximity of processing units to memory, could offer significant speed advantages for such algorithms.

While the article acknowledges the existence of Itanium-2 processors, its primary focus is on showcasing the benefits of PIM technology.  The Itanium-2 is mentioned in the context of benchmarking PIM performance: "Measured speedups of 8x are shown on two additional bandwidth benchmarks, even though the Itanium-2 has a clock rate 6X faster." 

This statement implies that, despite Itanium-2's faster clock speed, PIM still achieves significant speedups. This highlights PIM's advantage in handling data-intensive tasks, effectively portraying Itanium-2 as a less efficient alternative in this specific scenario. 

**Therefore, the article's sentiment towards Itanium is subtly negative, placing it in the context of a less performant alternative to PIM technology.**

Response:
## Analyzing the Sentiment Towards Itanium:

The article's **goal** is to provide a clear and programmer-friendly description of the Itanium architecture's memory consistency model. This model dictates how memory operations are ordered and seen by different processors, crucial for writing correct multi-threaded programs.  

The authors aim to simplify the understanding of this complex system by abstracting away the intricate architectural details. They achieve this by offering two slightly different definitions of the memory consistency model, both motivated by different implementations of "load-acquire" instructions, a key component of memory ordering.  

While the article doesn't explicitly praise or criticize Itanium, it acknowledges the challenges in understanding its memory model. The authors emphasize the need for a programmer-centric description to make Itanium more accessible and easier to program for. 

This focus on simplifying the model can be interpreted as a **subtle critique** of the Itanium architecture itself.  By presenting two different, but similar, definitions, they imply that the Itanium memory model's complexity might be a point of concern for developers. 

**Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium is [ -1 ] - Signs of critique.**

2006-01-01 - Recovery code generation for general speculative optimizations

Article:
A general framework that integrates both control and data speculation using alias profiling and/or compiler heuristic rules has shown to improve CPU2000 performance on Itanium systems. However, speculative optimizations require check instructions and recovery code to ensure correct execution when speculation fails at runtime. How to generate check instructions and their associated recovery code efficiently and effectively is an issue yet to be well studied. It is also, very important that the recovery code generated in the earlier phases integrate gracefully in the later optimization phases. At the very least, it should not hinder later optimizations, thus, ensuring overall performance improvement. This paper proposes a framework that uses an if-block structure to facilitate check instructions and recovery code generation for general speculative optimizations. It allows speculative instructions and their recovery code generated in the early compiler optimization phases to be integrated effectively with the subsequent optimization phases. It also allows multilevel speculation for multilevel pointers and multilevel expression trees to be handled with no additional complexity. The proposed recovery code generation framework has been implemented and evaluated in the Open Research Compiler (ORC).  2006, ACM. All rights reserved. . Keywords:;

2006-01-01 - Solution of large complex problems in computational electromagnetics using higher-order basis in MoM with out-of-core solvers

Article:
In a recent invited paper in the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, some of the challenging problems in computational electromagnetics were presented. One of the objectives of this note is to simply point out that challenging to one may be simple to another. This is demonstrated through an example cited in that article. The example chosen is a Vivaldi antenna array. What we discuss here also applies to the other examples presented in that article, but we have chosen the Vivaldi antenna array to help us make our point. It is shown in this short article that a higher-order basis using a surface integral equation a la a PMCHWT (Poggio-Miller-Chu-Harrington-Wu-Tsai) Method-of-Moments formulation may still be the best weapon that one have in today's arsenal to deal with challenging complex electromagnetic analysis problems. Here, we have used the commercially available code WIPL-D to carry out all the computations using laptop/desktop systems. The second objective of this paper is to present an out-of-Gore solver. The goal is to demonstrate that an out-of-core 32-bit-system-based solver can be as efficient as a 64-bit in-core solver. This is quite contrary to the popular belief that an out-of-core solver is generally much slower than an in-core solver. This can be significant, as the difference in the cost of a 32-bit system can be 1/30 of a 64-bit system of similar capabilities using current computer architectures. For the 32-bit system, we consider a Pentium 4 system, whereas for the 64-bit system, we consider an Itanium 2 system for comparison. The out-of-core solver can go beyond the 2 GB limitation for a 32-bit system and can be run on ordinary laptop/desktop; hence, we can simultaneously have a much lower hardware investment while better performance for a sophisticated and powerful electromagnetic solver. The system resources and the CPU times are also outlined.  2006 IEEE. .

1. **Highlight the effectiveness of higher-order basis functions in MoM for complex problems.** The article uses a Vivaldi antenna array as an example to demonstrate this point.
2. **Introduce an out-of-core solver, which allows for efficient computation on 32-bit systems.** This challenges the common belief that out-of-core solvers are significantly slower than in-core solvers.
3. **Show that a powerful electromagnetic solver can be run on less expensive 32-bit systems, thanks to the out-of-core solver.** This contrasts the typical need for more expensive 64-bit systems to handle complex problems.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article doesn't directly praise or criticize Itanium. Instead, it uses Itanium as a **benchmark** for comparison to a **Pentium 4 system**. 

Here's how the comparison unfolds:

* The article acknowledges that 64-bit systems like Itanium are generally considered more powerful than 32-bit systems.
* However, the article's focus is on showcasing the capabilities of the out-of-core solver, which allows for efficient computations even on a 32-bit system (Pentium 4).
* By comparing the performance of the out-of-core solver on a 32-bit system to a 64-bit system (Itanium 2), the authors indirectly emphasize the **advantages of the out-of-core solver over needing a more expensive 64-bit system.**

**Sentiment Score:**

While the article doesn't explicitly express negative feelings towards Itanium, the focus on the out-of-core solver's capabilities on a less expensive 32-bit system, in contrast to the performance of a 64-bit Itanium system, subtly suggests **an indirect critique of Itanium's necessity** for complex electromagnetic analysis.

Article:
The design of the high end server processor code named Montecito incorporated several ambitious goals requiring innovation. The most obvious being the incorporation of two legacy cores on-die and at the same time reducing power by 23%. This is an effective 325% increase in MIPS per watt which necessitated a holistic focus on power reduction and management. The next challenge in the implementation was to ensure robust and high frequency circuit operation in the 90-nm process generation which brings with it higher leakage and greater variability. Achieving this goal required new methodologies for design, a greatly improved and tunable clock system and a better understanding of our power grid behavior all of which required new circuits and capabilities. The final aspect of circuit design improvement involved the I/O design for our legacy multi-drop system bus. To properly feed the two high frequency cores with memory bandwidth we needed to ensure frequency headroom in the operation of the bus. This was achieved through several innovations in controllability and tuning of the I/O buffers which are discussed as well. .

2006-01-01 - Translating between itanium and sparc memory consistency models

Article:
Our general goal is to port programs from one multiprocessor architecture to another, while ensuring that each program's semantics remains unchanged. This paper addresses a subset of the problem by determining the relationships between memory consistency models of three Sparc architectures, (TSO, PSO and RMO) and that of the Itanium architecture. First we consider Itanium programs that are constrained to have only one load-type of instruction in {load, load-acquire}, and one store-type of instruction in {store, store_release}. We prove that in three out of four cases, the set of computations of any such program is exactly the set of computations of the "same" program (using only load and store) on one Sparc architecture. In the remaining case the set is nested between two natural sets of Sparc computations. Real Itanium programs, however, use a mixture of load, load_acquire, store, store-release and memory fence instructions, and real Sparc programs use a variety of barrier instruction as well as load and store instructions. We next show that any mixture of the load-types or the store-types (in the case of Itanium) or any barrier instructions (in the case of Sparc) completely destroys the clean and simple similarities between the sets of computations of these systems. Thus (even without considering the additional complications due to register and control dependencies) transforming these more general programs in either direction requires constraining the transformed program substantially more than the original program in order to ensure that no erroneous computations can arise.

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article:

The article focuses on **porting programs between different multiprocessor architectures**, specifically between Itanium and three different Sparc architectures (TSO, PSO, and RMO). The goal is to understand the relationships between the memory consistency models of these architectures and how they impact program semantics.

The article's main findings can be summarized as follows:

* **Simple Programs:** For Itanium programs using only "load" and "store" instructions with specific load/store combinations (load-acquire/store_release), the sets of computations are largely equivalent to those on Sparc architectures (with three out of four cases showing exact equivalence). This suggests that simple Itanium programs can be easily ported to Sparc.
* **Complex Programs:**  When Itanium programs employ a mix of load-types, store-types, and memory fences, or when Sparc programs use barrier instructions, the clean and simple relationship between the sets of computations breaks down. This means porting such programs becomes significantly more complex and requires substantial constraints to ensure correct semantics.

**Regarding Itanium, the authors' sentiment is primarily neutral.**  They acknowledge the potential for simpler programs to be ported with minimal changes, highlighting the similarities in memory consistency models. However, they also emphasize the complications that arise with more complex Itanium programs, which ultimately necessitate more significant constraints during porting. This focus on the difficulties of porting complex programs, while not explicitly negative towards Itanium, indirectly suggests that Itanium's architecture presents challenges for certain types of programs.

Title:
2006-01-01 - Ultra-fast CPU performance prediction: Extending the Monte Carlo approach

Article:
Performance evaluation of contemporary processors is becoming increasingly difficult due to the lack of proper frameworks. Traditionally, cycle-accurate simulators have been extensively used due to their inherent accuracy and flexibility. However, the effort involved in building them, their slow speed, and their limited ability to provide insight often imposes constraints on the extent of design exploration. In this paper, we refine our earlier Monte Carlo based CPIprediction model [11] to include software assisted data-prefetching and an improved memory model. Softwarebased prefetching is becoming an increasingly important feature in modern processors but to the best of our knowledge, existing frameworks do not model it. Our model uses microarchitecture independent application characteristics to predict CPI with an average error of less than 10% when vaidated against the Itanium-2 processor. Besides accurate performance prediction, we illustrate the applications of the model to processor bottle-neck analysis, workload characterization and design space exploration.  2006 IEEE. .

2006-01-01 - Using adaptive circuits to mitigate process variations in a microprocessor design

Article:
With each successive technology generation, process and environmental variations consume an increasingly large portion of the design envelope. To mitigate the impact of these variations, designs can incorporate adaptive techniques to reduce the impact. At the core of adaptability is the fundamental idea that each piece of silicon is different and will respond differently to stimuli. This poses a significant challenge in testing the product because testing relies on all parts behaving in a predictable manner every time they are tested. This article details adaptive techniques used on a dual-core, 90-nm Itanium microprocessor, and the issues and limitations encountered when testing this design.  2006 IEEE. .

2006-01-01 - Whole-program optimization of global variable layout

Article:
On machines with high-performance processors, the memory system continues to be a performance bottleneck. Compilers insert prefetch operations and reorder data accesses to improve locality, but increasingly seek to modify an application's data layout to reduce cache miss and page fault penalties. In this paper we discuss Global Variable Layout (GVL), an optimization of the placement of entire static global data objects in the binary. We describe two practical methods for GVL in the HP-UX Integrity optimizing compiler for the Itanium  architecture. The first layout strategy relies on profile feedback, collaboratively employing the compiler, the linker and a pre-link tool to facilitate reordering. The second strategy uses whole-program analysis to drive data layout decisions, and does not require the use of a dynamic profile. We give a detailed description of our implementation and evaluate its performance for the SPEC integer benchmark programs, as well as for a large commercial database application.

2007-01-01 - A magnetoelectronic register file cell for a self-checkpointing microprocessor

Article:
A self-checkpointing microprocessor periodically copies the state of the currently executing program to on-chip non-volatile storage, allowing it to resume execution of the program at the last checkpoint after a power supply interruption or shutdown. In this paper, we present a register file cell for a self-checkpointing microprocessor that integrates a magnetoelectronic non-volatile memory cell into a register cell similar to the one used in the Itanium 2 microprocessor. Our design allows the contents of each bit in the register file to be checkpointed simultaneously, reducing the time required to take a checkpoint to a few clock cycles, without compromising the performance of the register file during normal read and write operations. Because the area of the base register file cell is determined by the wiring tracks it requires, adding self-checkpointing to the cell only increases its area by 6%. Similarly, adding self-checkpointing has effectively no impact on the cell's performance, only increasing read and write times from 299 to 300 ps, even when the additional load on the bit lines from the larger cells is considered.

2007-01-01 - Abiego: A function outlining and partial inlining framework

Article:
Frequently invoked large functions are common in non-numeric applications. These large functions present challenges to modern compilers not only because they require more time and resources at compilation time, but also because they may prevent optimizations such as function inlining. Often large portions of the code in a hot function fhost are executed much less frequently than fhost itself. Partial inlining is a natural solution to the problems caused by including cold code segments that are seldom executed into hot functions that are frequently invoked. When applying partial inlining, a compiler outlines cold statements from a hot function fhost. After outlining, fhost becomes smaller and thus can be easily inlined. This paper presents Ablego, a framework for function outlining and partial inlining that includes several innovations: (1) an abstract-syntax-tree-based analysis and transformation to form cold regions for outlining; (2) a set of flexible heuristics to control the aggressiveness of function outlining; (3) several possible function outlining strategies; (4) explicit variable spilling, a new technique that overcomes negative side-effects of function outlining. With the proper strategy, partial inlining improves performance by up to 5.75%. A performance study also suggests that partial inlining's effect on enabling more aggressive inlining is limited. The performance improvement from partial inlining actually comes from better code placement and better code generation. Copyright  2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. .

* **Outline cold code segments** (those rarely executed) from hot functions (frequently executed).
* **Make the hot function smaller**, enabling easier inlining.
* **Improve overall performance** through better code placement and generation.

**Itanium is mentioned only once**, as an example platform where Ablego was tested: "Several possible function outlining strategies;... (4) explicit variable spilling, a new technique that overcomes negative side-effects of function outlining. With the proper strategy, partial inlining improves performance by up to 5.75%. **A performance study also suggests that partial inlining's effect on enabling more aggressive inlining is limited.** The performance improvement from partial inlining actually comes from better code placement and better code generation. Copyright  2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

**Analysis of Itanium Mention:**

The article mentions Itanium as a platform for evaluating the performance of Ablego. While the study indicates that partial inlining did not significantly impact the ability to perform aggressive inlining, it **does highlight the positive performance improvement achieved through better code placement and generation**. 

**Therefore, the article's sentiment towards Itanium is neutral.** The article focuses on the general optimization technique of partial inlining and uses Itanium as a testbed without specifically praising or criticizing it.

2007-01-01 - Applying code specialization to FFT libraries for integral parameters

Article:
Code specialization is an approach that can be used to improve the sequence of optimizations to be performed by the compiler. The performance of code after specialization may vary, depending upon the structure of the application. For FFT libraries, the specialization of code with different parameters may cause an increase in code size, thereby impacting overall behavior of applications executing in environment with small instruction caches. In this article, we propose a new approach for specializing FFT code that can be effectively used to improve performance while limiting the code increase by incorporating dynamic specialization. Our approach makes use of a static compile time analysis and adapts a single version of code to multiple values through runtime specialization. This technique has been applied to different FFT libraries over Itanium IA-64 platform using ice compiler v 9.0. For highly efficient libraries, we are able to achieve speedup of more than 80% with small increase in code size.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. .

2007-01-01 - Challenges for formal verification in industrial setting

Article:
Commercial competition is forcing computer companies to get better products to market more rapidly, and therefore the time for validation is shrinking relative to the complexity of microprocessor designs. Improving time-to-market performance cannot be solved by just growing the size of design and validation teams. Design process automation is increasing, and the adoption of more rigorous methods, including formal verification, is unavoidable because for achieving the quality demanded by the marketplace. Intel is one of the strongest promoters of the use of formal methods across all phases of the design development. Intel's design teams use high-level modeling of protocols and algorithms, formal verification of floatingpoint libraries, design exploration systems based on formal methods, full proofs and property verification of RTL specifications, and equivalence checking to verify that transistor-level schematics correspond to their RTL specifications. Even with the best effort to adopt the progress in formal methods quickly, there is a large gap between an idea published at a conference and a development of a tool that can be used on industrial-sized designs. These tools and methods need to scale well, be stable during a multi-year design effort, and be able to support efficient debugging. The use of formal methods on a live design must allow for ongoing changes in the specification and the design. The methodology must be flexible enough to permit new design features, such as scan and power-down logic, soft error detection, etc. In this paper, I will share my experience with the formal verification of the floating-point unit on an Itanium(R) microprocessor design and point out how it may influence future microprocessor-design projects.

2007-01-01 - COBRA: An adaptive runtime binary optimization framework for multithreaded applications

Article:
This paper presents COBRA (Continuous Binary Re-Adaptation), a runtime binary optimization framework, for multithreaded applications. It is currently implemented on Itanium 2 based SMP and cc-NUMA systems. Using OpenMP NAS parallel benchmark, we show how COBRA can adaptively choose appropriate optimizations according to observed changing runtime program behavior. Coherent cache misses caused by true/false data sharing often limit the scalability of multithreaded applications. This paper shows that COBRA can significantly improve the performance of some applications parallelized with OpenMP, by reducing the aggressiveness of data prefetching and by using exclusive hints for prefetch instructions. For example, we show that COBRA can improve the performance of OpenMP NAS parallel benchmarks up to 68%, with an average of 17.5% on the SGI Altix cc-NUMA system.  2007 IEEE. .

2007-01-01 - Compiler optimizations for fault tolerance software checking

Article:
Dramatic increases in the number of transistors that can be integrated on a chip will make the hardware more susceptible to radiation-induced transient errors. High-end architectures like the IBM mainframes, HP NonStop or mission-critical computers are likely to include several hardware-intensive fault tolerance techniques. However, the commodity chips which are cost- and energy-constrained, will need a more flexible and inexpensive technology for error detection. Software approaches can play a major role for this sector of the market because they need little hardware modification and can be tailored to fit different requirements of reliability and performance. Current software approaches address the problem by replicating the instructions and adding checking instructions to compare the results [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. These checking instructions account for a significant fraction of the added overhead. In this work we propose a set of compiler optimizations to identify and remove redundant checks from the replicated code. Two checks are considered redundant if they check the same variable. In this case, it is possible to remove the check that appears first during execution so that an error will be detected when the second check executes. However, determining how much a check can be delayed is tricky. If we delay it too little, there is little room for optimization. If we delay it too much, the errors will propagate to undesired places and result in segmentation faults, corrupted memory, wrong execution path, or undetected errors across checkpoints. We consider that how much the error detection can be delayed will depend on the recovery mechanism supported by the hardware or the system. As long as checks are not delayed beyond synchronization checkpoints, the system will be able to properly recover. With our techniques the user can define what are the synchronization checkpoints based on the hardware support for recovery. In this work we evaluate two levels of hardware or system support: memory without support for checkpointing and rollback, where memory is guaranteed to not be corrupted with wrong values and memory with low-cost support for checkpointing and rollback. We also consider the situation where register file is protected with parity or ECC, such as Intel Itanium, Sun UltraSPARC and IBM Power4-6 because software implementations can take advantage of this hardware feature and reduce some of the replicated instructions. We have evaluated our approach using LLVM as our compiler infrastructure and PIN for fault injection. Our experimental results with Spec benchmarks on a Pentium 4 show that in the case where memory is guaranteed not to be corrupted, performance improves by an average 6.2%. With more support for checkpoint performance improves by an average 14.7%. A software fault tolerant system that takes advantage of the register safe platforms improves by an average 16.0%. Fault injection experiments show that our techniques do not decrease fault coverage, although they slightly increase the number of segmentation faults.  2007 IEEE. .

2007-01-01 - Development of parallel density functional program using distributed matrix to calculate all-electron canonical wavefunction of large molecules

Article:
We developed a new parallel density-functional canonical molecular-orbital program for large molecules based on the resolution of the identity method. In this study, all huge matrices were decomposed and saved to the distributed local memory. The routines of the analytical molecular integrals and numerical integrals of the exchange-correlation terms were parallelized using the single program multiple data method. A conventional linear algebra matrix library, ScaLAPACK, was used for matrix operations, such as diagonalization, multiplication, and inversion. Anderson's mixing method was adopted to accelerate the self-consistent field (SCF) convergence. Using this program, we calculated the canonical wavefunctions of a 306-residue protein, insulin hexamer (26,790 orbitals), and a 133-residue protein, interleukin (11,909 orbitals) by the direct-SCF method. In regard to insulin hexamer, the total parallelization efficiency of the first SCF iteration was estimated to be 82% using 64 Itanium 2 processors connected at 3.2 GB/s (SGI Altix3700), and the calculation successfully converged at the 17-th SCF iteration. By adopting the update method, the computational time of the first and the final SCF loops was 229 min and 156 min, respectively. The whole computational time including the calculation before the SCF loop was 2 days and 17 h. This study put the calculations of the canonical wavefunction of 30,000 orbitals to practical use.  2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. .

2007-01-01 - Iterative compilation with kernel exploration

Article:
The increasing complexity of hardware mechanisms for recent processors makes high performance code generation very challenging. One of the main issue for high performance is the optimization of memory accesses. General purpose compilers, with no knowledge of the application context and approximate memory model, seem inappropriate for this task. Combining application-dependent optimizations on the source code and exploration of optimization parameters as it is achieved with ATLAS, has been shown as one way to improve performance. Yet, hand-tuned codes such as in the MKL library still outperform ATLAS with an important speed-up and some effort has to be done in order to bridge the gap between performance obtained by automatic and manual optimizations. In this paper, a new iterative compilation approach for the generation of high performance codes is proposed. This approach is not applicationdependent, compared to ATLAS. The idea is to separate the memory optimization phase from the computation optimization phase. The first step automatically finds all possible decompositions of the code into kernels. With datasets that fit into the cache and simplified memory accesses, these kernels are simpler to optimize, either with the compiler, at source level, or with a dedicated code generator. The best decomposition is then found by a model-guided approach, performing on the source code the required memory optimizations. Exploration of optimization sequences and their parameters is achieved with a meta-compilation language, X language. The first results on linear algebra codes for Itanium show that the performance obtained reduce the gap with those of highly optimized hand-tuned codes.  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. .

## Sentiment Analysis:

The article focuses on **improving code generation for high-performance computing**, particularly addressing the challenges of optimizing memory access. It argues that traditional compilers are not sufficient for this task due to their lack of application context and simplified memory models. 

The article proposes a **new iterative compilation approach**, which involves:

1. **Kernel exploration:** Automatically identifying different code decompositions into "kernels" - smaller, more easily optimized code blocks. 
2. **Optimization**: Utilizing either the compiler, source-level optimizations, or dedicated code generators to optimize these kernels.
3. **Model-guided decomposition selection**: Utilizing a model-driven approach to determine the best decomposition, potentially involving source code memory optimizations.
4. **Exploration of optimization sequences:** Utilizing a meta-compilation language, "X language", to explore and experiment with various optimization sequences and parameters.

**Regarding Itanium:**

The article **mentions Itanium specifically as a target platform** for testing their approach. The results section notes that "the performance obtained reduce the gap with those of highly optimized hand-tuned codes" for linear algebra codes on Itanium. 

This suggests that while the approach was successful in bridging the performance gap between automatically and manually optimized code on Itanium, it **doesn't explicitly praise Itanium's capabilities** or highlight it as a superior platform. 

**Sentiment Grade:**

Based on the analysis, the article exhibits a **neutral sentiment towards Itanium**.  While Itanium serves as the testbed for their approach, the focus remains on the general optimization techniques, not on showcasing Itanium's advantages.

2007-01-01 - Leveraging predicated execution for multimedia processing

Article:
Modern compression standards such as H.264, DivX, or VC-1 provide astonishing quality at the costs of steadily increasing processing requirements. Therefore, efficient solutions for mobile multimedia devices have to effectively leverage instruction level parallelism (ILP), which is often achieved by the deployment of EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) architectures. A characteristical architectural feature to increase the available ILP in the presence of control flow is predicated execution. Compilers targeting those hardware platforms are responsible to carefully convert control flow into conditional/predicated instructions - a process called if-conversion. We describe an effective if-conversion algorithm for the CHILI - a novel hardware architecture specifically designed for digital video processing and mobile multimedia consumer electronic. Several architectural characteristics such as the lack of branch prediction units, large delay slots, and the provided predication model are significantly different from previous work, typically aiming mainstream architectures such as Intel Itanium. The algorithm has been implemented for an optimizing compiler based on LLVM. Experimental results using a cycle accurate simulator for the well known benchmark suite MiBench and several multimedia codecs show a speed improvement of about 18% on average. On the same programs, our compiler achieves a speedup of 21% in comparison to the existing code generator based on gcc.  2007 IEEE. .

2007-01-01 - Loop optimization using hierarchical compilation and kernel decomposition

Article:
The increasing complexity of hardware features for recent processors makes high performance code generation very challenging. In particular, several optimization targets have to be pursued simultaneously (minimizing L1/L2/L3/TLB misses and maximizing instruction level parallelism). Very often, these optimization goals impose different and contradictory constraints on the transformations to be applied. We propose a new hierarchical compilation approach for the generation of high performance code relying on the use of state-of-the-art compilers. This approach is not application-dependent and do not require any assembly hand-coding. It relies on the decomposition of the original loop nest into simpler kernels, typically 1D to 2D loops, much simpler to optimize. We successfully applied this approach to optimize dense matrix muliply primitives (not only for the square case but to the more general rectangular cases) and convolution. The performance of the optimized codes on Itanium 2 and Pentium 4 architectures outperforms ATLAS and in most cases, matches hand-tuned vendor libraries (e.g. MKL).  2007 IEEE. .

Article:
In this paper, we describe our experience of creating an OpenMP implementation of the SPICE3 circuit simulator program. Given the irregular patterns of access to dynamic data structures in the SPICE code, a parallelization using current standard OpenMP directives is impossible without major rewriting of the original program. The aim of this work is to present a case study showing the development of a shared memory parallel code with minimum effort. We present two implementations, one with minimal code modification and one without modification to the original SPICE3 program using Intel's taskq construct. We also discuss the results of the case study in terms of what future compiler tools may be needed to help OpenMP application developers with similar porting goals. Our experiments using SPICE3, based on SRAM model simulation, were compiled by the SUN compiler running on a SunFire V880 UltraSPARC-III 750 MHz and by the Intel icc compiler running on both an IBM Itanium with four CPUs and Intel Xeon of two processors machines.

We present a global instruction scheduler based on integer linear programming (ILP) that was implemented experimentally in the Intel Itanium product compiler. It features virtually the full scale of known EPIC scheduling optimizations, more than its heuristic counterpart in the compiler, GCS, and in contrast to the latter it computes optimal solutions in the form of schedules with minimal length. Due to our highly efficient ILP model it can solve problem instances with 500-750 instructions, and in combination with region scheduling we are able to schedule routines of arbitrary size. In experiments on five SPEC CPU2006 integer benchmarks, ILP-scheduled code exhibits a 32% schedule length advantage and a 10% runtime speedup over GCS-scheduled code, at the highest compiler optimization levels typically used for SPEC submissions. We further study the impact of different code motion classes, region sizes, and target microarchitectures, gaining insights into the nature of the global instruction scheduling problem.  2007 IEEE. .

2007-01-01 - Performance and security lessons learned from virtualizing the alpha processor

Article:
Virtualization has become much more important throughout the computer industry both to improve security and to support multiple workloads on the same hardware with effective isolation between those workloads. The most widely used chip architecture, the Intel and AMD x86 processors, have begun to support virtualization, but the initial implementations show some limitations. This paper examines the virtualization properties of the Alpha architecture with particular emphasis on features that improve performance and security. It shows how the Alpha's features of PALcode, address space numbers, software handling of translation buffer misses, lack of used and modified bits, and secure handling of unpredictable results all contribute to making virtualization of the Alpha particularly easy. The paper then compares the virtual architecture of the Alpha with Intel's and AMD's virtualization approaches for x86. It also comments briefly on Intel's virtualization technology for Itanium, IBM's zSeries and pSeries hypervisors and Sun's UltraSPARC virtualization. It particularly identifies some differences between translation buffers on x86 and translation buffers on VAX and Alpha that can have adverse performance consequences. Copyright 2007 ACM. .

2007-01-01 - Performance driven data cache prefetching in a dynamic software optimization system

Article:
Software or hardware data cache prefetching is an efficient way to hide cache miss latency. However effectiveness of the issued prefetches have to be monitored in order to maximize their positive impact while minimizing their negative impact on performance. In previous proposed dynamic frameworks, the monitoring scheme is either achieved using processor performance counters or using specific hardware. In this work, we propose a prefetching strategy which does not use any specific hardware component or processor performance counter. Our dynamic framework wants to be portable on any modern processor architecture providing at least a prefetch instruction. Opportunity and effectiveness of prefetching loads is simply guided by the time spent to effectively obtain the data. Every load of a program is monitored periodically and can be either associated to a dynamically inserted prefetch instruction or not. It can be associated to a prefetch instruction at some disjoint periods of the whole program run as soon as it is efficient. Our framework has been implemented for Itanium-2 machines. It involves several dynamic instrumentations of the binary code whose overhead is limited to only 4% on average. On a large set of benchmarks, our system is able to speed up some programs by 2% - 143%. Copyright 2007 ACM. .

2007-01-01 - Propagation of UWB pulses on metal strips printed on semiconductor dielectrics

Article:
The interaction of ultra-wideband pulses propagating on a semiconductor substrate is analysed without solving the charge dynamic equations. This study demonstrates the systematic approach for selecting semiconductor parameters and their significance in the practical design of high speed microstrip interconnects. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a comprehensive and conceptual study of EMP interaction with semiconductor dielectrics has been performed. The comparison of waveforms on single and coupled lines elucidates the mechanisms of pulse distortion on semiconductor substrates. However, the realization of the dielectric relaxation is studied by changing the doping concentrations of the substrate. Moreover, the evolution of currents for different conductivities illustrates the realization of the doping concentration in a semiconductor. Furthermore, the study on layered substrates with different doping concentrations and relative permittivities demonstrates the fidelity of waveforms on the source line and significantly weak coupling to the victim line. This analysis is a first step towards the full-fledged self-consistent simulations of EMP interaction with the physical model of semiconductor devices.

2007-01-01 - Rectangular full packed format for LAPACK algorithms timings on several computers

Article:
We describe a new data format for storing triangular and symmetric matrices called RFP (Rectangular Full Packed). The standard two dimensional arrays of Fortran and C (also known as full format) that are used to store triangular and symmetric matrices waste nearly half the storage space but provide high performance via the use of level 3 BLAS. Standard packed format arrays fully utilize storage (array space) but provide low performance as there are no level 3 packed BLAS. We combine the good features of packed and full storage using RFP format to obtain high performance using L3 (level 3) BLAS as RFP is full format. Also, RFP format requires exactly the same minimal storage as packed format. Each full and/or packed symmetric/triangular routine becomes a single new RFP routine. We present LAPACK routines for Cholesky factorization, inverse and solution computation in RFP format to illustrate this new work and to describe its performance on the IBM, Itanium, NEC, and SUN platforms. Performance of RFP versus LA-PACK full routines for both serial and SMP parallel processing is about the same while using half the storage, Performance is roughly one to a factor of 33 for serial and one to a factor of 100 for SMP parallel times faster than LAPACK packed routines. Existing LAPACK routines and vendor LAPACK routines were used in the serial and the SMP parallel study, respectively. In both studies vendor L3 BLAS were used.

2007-01-01 - Three-dimensional bursting and parallel computing

Article:
This work presents a mathematical model and its parallel implementation via two parallel paradigms for the simulation of three-dimensional bursting phenomena. The mathematical model consists of four nonlinearly coupled partial differential equations and includes fast and slow subsystems. The differential equations have been discretized by means of a linearly implicit finite difference method in equally spaced grids. The resulting system of equations at each time level has been solved by means of an optimized preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The proposed mathematical model has been implemented via (i) a message passing paradigm based on the standard MPI and (ii) a shared address space paradigm based on SPMD OpenMP. The two implementations have been evaluated on three current parallel architectures, namely, a cluster of dual Xeon, a SGI Altix 3700 Bx2 system based on Itanium, and a Sun Fire E15K. It is shown that for the conditions reported here, the nonlinear dynamics of the three-dimensional bursting phenomena exhibits four different regimes, charachterized by asynchronous, synchronous, and then asynchronous oscillations before a quiescent state is reached.

Article:
Self-consistent 3-D FDTD analysis of a bounded-wave EMP simulator with a human model in the presence of a complex electrical environment is performed. The designed EMP simulator could be directly applied to the optimization of EMP for a desired level of the field intensity and risetime in UWB pulsed applications. Using a fine mesh and an Itanium II 160 processor cluster allowed the risetime of 1.4 ns - very close to the experimental design of 1 ns. This study is significantly important for investigating the effects of intense UWB pulses on biological cells. A detailed analysis from the pointof-view of physical understanding the effects of EMP on human tissue is presented.

2007-01-01 - What is Itanium Memory Consistency from the Programmer's Point of View?

Article:
A programmer-centric model describes the memory consistency rules of amultiprocessor as a collection, one for each processor, of 'views' of instructions and some agreements between these views. It also requires the natural notion of validity: the value read from a shared memory location is the one that was most recently stored, according to a given view. This allows reasoning about programs at a non-operational level in the natural way, not obscured by the implementation details of the underlying architecture. In this paper, we formulate a programmer-centric description of the memory consistency model provided by the Itanium architecture. However, our definition is not tight. We provide two very similar definitions and show that the specification of the Itanium memory model lies between the two. These two definitions are motivated by slightly different implementations of load-acquire instructions. A further entertainment of a handful of other load-acquire rules leads us to question whether the specification of the Itanium memory order [Intel Corporation. A formal specification of the intel itanium processor family memory ordering. http://www.intel.com/, Oct 2002] is indeed faithful to the Itanium architecture intentions.  2007 Elsevier B.V.

## Analyzing the Sentiment of the Itanium Article

The article focuses on providing a programmer-centric description of the memory consistency model used by the Itanium architecture. The authors aim to achieve two key goals:

1. **Clarify the memory consistency rules:** The article seeks to simplify the complex memory consistency model of Itanium by offering a clear and intuitive explanation that programmers can readily understand. This is achieved by using a "view" model and emphasizing the notion of validity. 
2. **Evaluate the specification's faithfulness:**  The authors raise concerns about the official specification of Itanium's memory ordering. They present two slightly different definitions of the memory model and suggest that the actual implementation of the Itanium architecture lies somewhere between these two. Further, they explore alternative "load-acquire" rules, questioning the accuracy of the official specification in representing the intended behavior of the architecture.

**Sentiment Analysis:**

While the article focuses on a technical description of the Itanium memory model, its core message is not entirely positive. While aiming to offer clarity, the authors highlight discrepancies between the formal specification and the actual implementation of Itanium's memory ordering. This raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the official documentation.  The exploration of alternative "load-acquire" rules further suggests potential inconsistencies and complexities within the architecture, which could be problematic for developers.

**Sentiment Score:**  

The article doesn't explicitly condemn Itanium, but it does expose potential issues and inconsistencies in its memory model. This critique, while technical in nature, ultimately casts a shadow on the architecture's reliability and clarity.  Therefore, the most accurate sentiment score is **[-1] - Signs of critique**.

2008-01-01 - A hash-TLB approach for MMU virtualization in Xen/IA64

Article:
With advances in hardware-assisted full virtualization technologies, system virtualization based on the virtual machine monitor (VMM) has received much recent attention. Using the Xen/IA64 hardware virtual machine implemented on Intel Virtualization Technology for Itanium (VT-i), we investigate the design of a virtual software hash translation lookaside buffer (TLB) based on the virtual hash page table (VHPT). Experimental results show that the proposed design can significantly improve the performance of the hardware virtual machine of Xen/IA64. Our contributions are the following. First, we design and implement in the VMM a virtual hash TLB algorithm to optimize the system performance of VT-i guest virtual machines. Second, we quantify experimentally the performance benefits of the hash TLB for VT-i guest virtual machines and analyze the performance impact of the software VHPT walker with the hash TLB algorithm. Lastly, we present experiments to verify, in an SMP virtual machine system environment, the superior scalability of the hash TLB approach. 2008 IEEE. .

2008-01-01 - An effective automated approach to specialization of code

Article:
Application performance is heavily dependent on the compiler optimizations. Modern compilers rely largely on the information made available to them at the time of compilation. In this regard, specializing the code according to input values is an effective way to communicate necessary information to the compiler. However, the static specialization suffers from possible code explosion and dynamic specialization requires runtime compilation activities that may degrade the overall performance of the application. This article proposes an automated approach for specializing code that is able to address both the problems of code size increase and the overhead of runtime activities. We first obtain optimized code through specialization performed at static compile time and then generate a template that can work for a large set of values through runtime specialization. Our experiments show significant improvement for different SPEC benchmarks on Itanium-II(IA-64) and Pentium-IV processors using icc and gcc compilers.  2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. .

2008-01-01 - Analyzing mutual influences of high performance computing programs on SGI Altix 3700 and 4700 systems with PARbench

Article:
Nowadays, most high performance computing systems run in multiprogramming mode with several user programs simultaneously utilizing the available CPUs. Even though most current SMP systems are implemented as ccNUMA to reduce the bottleneck of main memory access, the user programs still compete in different ways for resources and influence the scheduler decisions with their generated load. This paper presents the investigation results of the SGI Altix 3700Bx2 of the TU-Dresden and its successor system the Altix 4700 with the PARbench system. The PARbench system is a multiprogramming and multithreading benchmark system, which enables the user to assess the system behaviour under typical production work load and identify bottlenecks and scheduling problems. The Altix 3700 and 4700 with their directory based ccNUMA architecture are the largest SMP systems on the market and promise a high scalability combined with a good isolation of the several system nodes. Several tests validates these promised features and analyzes the connection network and the utilized Intel Itanium 2 Madison (Altix 3700Bx2) and dual core Itanium 2 Montecito (Altix 4700) CPUs. The paper will also show practical problems of the shared system bus by two CPUs each in the 3700 system and compare these situation with the internally shared system bus of the dual core CPUs in the 4700 system. Further tests examine the load balancing behavior and it's consequences to OpenMP parallelized programs under overload.  2008 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved. . Keywords:;

2008-01-01 - Construction of speculative optimization algorithms

Article:
In modern processors, instructions to perform operations are often produced before it becomes known that this is required. Such an expedient, which is called speculative execution, helps to reveal parallelism at the instruction level. In the EPIC architectures, the speculative execution is completely controlled by the compiler, which makes it possible to avoid using complex hardware mechanisms for supporting speculative instruction production. Moreover, the idea of the speculative execution can be used by the compiler in machine-independent optimizations. The paper describes a scheme of construction of the speculative optimization that is based on the selection of properties of the control flow and data flow that are important from the optimization standpoint and on the estimation of the probabilities of their fulfillment. The probabilities found are used for searching and constructing advantageous speculative and bookkeeping transformations. For optimizations that include only speculative movements of instructions upwards along the control flow graph, on the basis of the suggested scheme, a method has been developed that includes algorithms for finding probabilities of data and control dependences, for estimating benefit of speculative movements, and for constructing a recovery code. On the basis of this method, an algorithm for the speculative scheduling of instructions for the Intel Itanium architecture has been developed and implemented. Specific features of its implementation and experimental results are described.  2008 MAIK Nauka. .

2008-01-01 - Correctly rounded multiplication by arbitrary precision constants

Article:
We introduce an algorithm for multiplying a floating-point number  by a constant C that is not exactly representable in floating-point arithmetic. Our algorithm uses a multiplication and a fused multiply and add instruction. Such instructions are available in some modern processors such as the IBM Power PC and the Intel/HP Itanium. We give three methods for checking whether, for a given value of C and a given floating-point format, our algorithm returns a correctly rounded result for any . When it does not, some of our methods return all the values  for which the algorithm fails. We generalize our study to the case where a wider internal format is used for the intermediate calculations, which gives a fourth method. Our programs and some additional information (such as the case where an arbitrary nonbinary even radix is used), as well as examples of runs of our programs can be downloaded from http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/jean-michel.muller/ MultConstant.html.  2008 IEEE. .

2008-01-01 - Fast, frequency-based, integrated register allocation and instruction scheduling

Article:
Instruction scheduling and register allocation are two of the most important optimization phases in modern compilers as they have a significant impact on the quality of the generated code. Unfortunately, the objectives of these two optimizations are in conflict with one another. The instruction scheduler attempts to exploit instruction-level parallelism and requires many operands to be available in registers. On the other hand, the register allocator wants register pressure to be kept low so that the amount of spill code can be minimized. Currently these two phases are done separately, typically in three passes: prepass scheduling, register allocation and postpass scheduling. But this separation can lead to poor results. Previous works attempted to solve the phase-ordering problem by combining the instruction scheduler with graph-coloring-based register allocators. The latter tend to be computationally expensive. Linear-scan register allocators, on the other hand, are simple, fast and efficient. In this paper, we describe our effort to integrate instruction scheduling with a linear-scan allocator. Furthermore, our integrated optimizer is able to take advantage of execution frequencies obtained through profiling. Our integrated register allocator and instruction scheduler achieved good code quality with significantly reduced compilation times. On the SPEC2000 benchmarks running on a 900 MHz Itanium II, compared with Open IMPACT, we halved the time spent in instruction scheduling and register allocation with negligible impact on execution times.

2008-01-01 - From speculation to security: Practical and efficient information flow tracking using speculative hardware

Article:
Dynamic information flow tracking (also known as taint tracking) is an appealing approach to combat various security attacks. However, the performance of applications can severely degrade without hardware support for tracking taints. This paper observes that information flow tracking can be efficiently emulated using deferred exception tracking in microprocessors supporting speculative execution. Based on this observation, we propose SHIFT, a low-overhead, software-based dynamic information flow tracking system to detect a wide range of attacks. The key idea is to treat tainted state (describing untrusted data) as speculative state (describing deferred exceptions). SHIFT leverages existing architectural support for speculative execution to track tainted state in registers and needs to instrument only load and store instructions to track tainted state in memory using a bitmap, which results in significant performance advantages. Moreover, by decoupling mechanisms for taint tracking from security policies, SHIFT can detect a wide range of exploits, including high-level semantic attacks. We have implemented SHIFT using the Itanium processor, which has support for deferred exceptions, and by modifying GCC to instrument loads and stores. A security assessment shows that SHIFT can detect both low-level memory corruption exploits as well as high-level semantic attacks with no false positives. Performance measurements show that SHIFT incurs about 1% overhead for server applications. The performance slowdown for SPEC-INT2000 is 2.81X and 2.27X for tracking at byte-level and word-level respectively. Minor architectural improvements to the Itanium processor (adding three simple instructions) can reduce the performance slowdown down to 2.32X and 1.8X for byte-level and word-level tracking, respectively.  2008 IEEE. .

2008-01-01 - Interprocedural speculative optimization of memory accesses to global variables

Article:
The discrepancy between processor and memory speed, also known as memory gap, is steadily increasing. This means that execution speed is more and more dominated by memory accesses. We investigate the use of globals, which reside inherently in memory, in standard applications and present an approach to reduce the number of memory accesses, thereby reducing the effect of the memory gap. Our approach can explicitly deal with uncertain information and, hence, optimize more aggressively with the help of speculative techniques while not changing the semantics of the optimized programs. We present an implementation of the proposed optimization in our compiler framework for the Intel Itanium and show that our techniques lead to an increased performance for the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks, thus showing that the impact of the memory gap can be effectively mitigated with advanced speculative optimization.  2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. .

2008-01-01 - Latency-tolerant software pipelining in a production compiler

Article:
In this paper we investigate the benefit of scheduling non-critical loads for a higher latency during software pipelining "Non-critical" denotes those loads that have sufficient slack in the cyclic data dependence graph so that increasing the scheduling distance to their first use can only increase the number of stages of the software pipeline, but should not increase the lengths of the individual stages, the initiation interval (II). The associated cost is in many cases negligible, but the memory stall reduction due to improved latency coverage and load clustering in the schedule can be considerable. We first analyze benefit and cost in theory and then present how we have implemented latency-tolerant pipelining experimentally in the Intel Itanium product compiler. A key component of the technique is the preselection of likely long-latency loads that is integrated into prefetching heuristics in the high-level optimizer. Only when applied selectively based on these prefetcher hints, the optimization gives the full benefit also without trip-count information from dynamic profiles. Experimental results show gains of up to 14%, with an average of 2.2%, in a wide range of SPEC CPU2000 and CPU2006 benchmarks. These gains were realized on top of best-performing compiler options typically used for SPEC submissions. Copyright 2008 ACM. .

2008-01-01 - Mapping table based register file design and compiler optimization

Article:
Register file design is very important in high performance processor design. Register Stack and Register Stack Engine are effective ways to improve performance. Compiler optimizations are often driven by specific assumptions about the underlying architecture and implementation of the target machine. In this paper, we present our efforts to design and implement register file management mechanism-MTRM (Mapping Table-based Register Management) on EDSMT, which is a kind of SMT architecture based on IA-64. MTRM assigns a Mapping Table for each thread to mapping their logic registers to physic registers, which adds a middle level into Itanium's original rename mechanism. MTRM focused on supporting the effective sharing of registers in an EDSMT processor, using register renaming to permit multiple threads to share a single global register file. Existing hardware is effective at allocating physical registers;it has only limited ability to identify register deallocation points. Compile optimization is considered to deallocate dead registers, while Special Bit and Special Instruction are used as two effective ways. Simulation results indicate that these mechanisms can reduce register deallocation ineffciencies;in particular, on small register files, the best of the schemes attains speedups of up to 2.2 for some applications, and 1.8 on average. .

2008-01-01 - MV-FT: Efficient implementation for matrix-vector multiplication on FT64 stream processor

Article:
In this paper, we present a detailed case study of the optimizing implementation of a fundamental scientific kernel, matrix-vector multiplication, on FT64, which is the first 64-bit stream processor designed for scientific computing. The major novelties of our study are as follows. First, we develop four stream programs according to different stream organizations, involving dot product, row product, multi-dot product and multirow product approaches. Second the optimal strip size for partitioning the large matrix is put forward based on a practical parameter model. Finally loop unrolling and software pipelining are used to hide the communications with the computations. The experimental results show that the optimizing implementations on FT64 achieve high speedup over the corresponding Fortran programs running on Itanium 2. It is certain that matrix-vector multiplication can efficiently exploit the tremendous potential of FT64 stream processor through programming optimizations.  2008 IEEE. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article Towards Itanium

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

This article focuses on optimizing the performance of matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) on the FT64 stream processor, a novel architecture designed for scientific computing. The authors present four stream program implementations based on different stream organizations, discuss the optimal matrix partitioning strategy, and highlight techniques like loop unrolling and software pipelining to optimize performance. The primary goal is to demonstrate the efficiency of FT64 for this fundamental scientific kernel and showcase the potential of stream processors for scientific computing.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

While the article primarily focuses on the advantages of FT64, it does **indirectly compare** it to Itanium 2.  The key point is that the optimized implementations on FT64 "achieve high speedup over the corresponding Fortran programs running on Itanium 2." This statement implies that FT64 outperforms Itanium 2 in terms of performance for MVM operations, which can be seen as a **subtle critique** of Itanium. However, the article **doesn't explicitly express negativity** towards Itanium, rather it simply focuses on showcasing the strengths of FT64.

**Conclusion:**

The article's primary focus is on the efficiency of FT64, but the comparison with Itanium 2 suggests a degree of skepticism or indirect negativity.  Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium can be classified as **[ -1 ] - Signs of critique**.

2008-01-01 - OLTP workloads on modern processor: Characterization and analysis

Article:
This paper analysis of how OLTP workloads interact with modern processors and caches behavior. First, we extend TPC-C, the OLTP-oriented benchmark, to ETPC-C benchmark, for measuring the performance of main-memory database (MMDBMS) more precisely. As the performance of MMDBMS is not affected by disk I/O, it is more sensitive to cache usage. Then using ETPC-C benchmark, we investigated the behavior of caches and processors extensively. We find that the miss stall time is mostly spent on on-CPU-chip caches, that is, the first and second level cache misses are dominant. Furthermore, we find instruction cache (I-cache) stall time of on-CPU-chip is a major component to the memory stall time. The smaller the emulated users, the more proportion the I-cache stall time of on-CPU-chip contributes to the memory stall time. However, if employing index, the system under test (SUT) has more total I-cache stall time than the SUT without index at the same number of emulated users and data population. Another observation is that the SUT with index has a little more branch misprediction rate than the SUT without index in average. Finally, we find only the third level (L3) D-cache stall time rate increases with the number of users. This is because L3 D-cache miss incremental rate is the largest. Under TPC-and ETPC-evaluation, we find that for optimized database performance on modern computers, reducing instruction miss penalty is equally important to reducing data miss penalty; since they are conflict efforts, the best way is to have them balanced. .

This article focuses on understanding how Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) workloads interact with modern processors and cache behavior. The authors aim to:

1. **Characterize OLTP workloads:** They extend the TPC-C benchmark to create a new benchmark called ETPC-C, which is specifically designed for main-memory database management systems (MMDBMS). This new benchmark allows for more accurate performance measurements in a scenario where disk I/O is irrelevant, thus highlighting the impact of cache utilization.
2. **Analyze the impact of cache usage:**  The authors use the ETPC-C benchmark to investigate how cache misses and instruction stalls affect overall performance. They investigate the performance of different cache levels (L1, L2, L3) and the impact of using indexes.
3. **Provide insights for database optimization:** The study concludes that minimizing both data and instruction miss penalties is crucial for optimizing database performance on modern computers.  

**Discussion of Itanium:**

The article does **not explicitly mention Itanium** throughout the text. It uses the phrase "modern computers" in a generic sense, without specifying a particular processor architecture.  

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

Multigrid methods are amongst the most efficient algorithms to numerically solve partial differential equations. However, standard implementations usually cannot exploit the potential of modern processors. The IA-64 architecture transferes most complexity to the software side to provide a highly superscalar design with large caches, leading to unique control over the actual execution. Exemplified on a simple multigrid solver equation in 3D and the Itanium 2 processor, we present how known performance optimisation techniques can be successfully combined. While implementation details are specific, the optimisation concept should be applicable for a wide range of numerical algorithm and CPUs.  2008, Inderscience Publishers. .

2008-01-01 - Optimizing code through iterative specialization

Article:
Code specialization is a way to obtain significant improvement in the performance of an application. It works by exposing values of different parameters in source code. The availability of these specialized values enables the compilers to generate better optimized code. Although most of the efficient source code implementations contain specialized code to benefit from these optimizations, the real impact of specialization may however vary depending upon the value of the specializing parameter. In this paper, we suggest the specialization of code to acquire an iterative approach. For some specialized code, wo search for a better version of code by re-specializing the code, followed by a low-level code analysis. The specialized versions fulfilling the required criteria arc then transformed to generate another equivalent version of the original specialized code. The approach has been tested on Itanium-II architecture using ice compiler. The results show significant improvement in the performance of different benchmarks. Copyright 2008 ACM. .

2008-01-01 - Performance evaluation of NSF application benchmarks on parallel systems

Article:
The National Science Foundation (NSF) recently released a set of application benchmarks that would be a key factor in selecting the next-generation high-performance computing environment. These benchmarks are designed to capture the salient attributes of those science and engineering applications placing the most stringent demands on the system to be provisioned. The application benchmarks consist of six codes that require large amount of memory and work with large data sets. In this work, we study the complexity, performance, and scalability of these codes on four machines: a 512-processor SGI Altix 3700, a 512-processor SGI Altix 3700/BX2, a 512-processor dual-core based SGI Altix 4700, and a 128-processor Cray Opteron cluster interconnected by the Myrinet network. We evaluated these codes for two different problem sizes using different numbers of processors. Our results show that per processor the SGI machines, using the Intel Itanium-2 processor, are faster than the Cray cluster, using the AMD Opteron processor, by a factor of up to three. Also, we found out that some of these codes scale up very well as we increase the number of processors while others scaled up poorly. In addition, one of the codes achieved about 2/3 of the peak rate of an SGI Altix processor. Moreover, the dual-core based system achieved comparable performance results to the single-core based system. Finally, we provide some limitations and concluding remarks. 2008 IEEE. .

2008-01-01 - Pre-virtualization: Soft layering for virtual machines

Article:
Despite its current popularity, para-virtualization has an enormous cost. Its deviation from the platform architecture abandons many of the benefits of traditional virtualization: stable and well-defined platform interfaces, hypervisor neutrality, operating system neutrality, and upgrade neutrality - in sum, modularity. Additionally, para-virtualization has a significant engineering cost. These limitations are accepted as inevitable for significantly better performance, and for the ability to provide virtualization-like behavior on non-virtualizable hardware such as x86. Virtualization and its modularity solve many systems problems, and when combined with the performance of para-virtualization become even more compelling. We show how to achieve both together. We still modify the guest operating system, but according to a set of design principles that avoids lock-in, which we call soft layering. Additionally, our approach is highly automated and thus reduces the implementation and maintenance burden of para-virtualization, which is especially useful for enabling obso-leted operating systems. We demonstrate soft layering on x86 and Itanium: we can load a single Linux binary on a variety of hypervisors (and thus substitute virtual machine environments and their enhancements), while achieving essentially the same performance as para-virtualization with less effort. 2008 IEEE. .

## Analyzing the Article's Sentiment Towards Itanium

The article focuses on the limitations of para-virtualization and how it negatively impacts the traditional benefits of virtualization like modularity, platform neutrality, and upgrade neutrality.  It introduces "soft layering" as a solution, a method that combines the performance benefits of para-virtualization with the modularity of traditional virtualization. The article then demonstrates this "soft layering" technique on both **x86** and **Itanium** architectures. 

**The article's key goal is to demonstrate the efficacy of "soft layering" as a solution to the shortcomings of para-virtualization.**  While Itanium is mentioned as one of the platforms where soft layering is implemented, it's not the primary focus of the article. Itanium is merely a **demonstration platform** for showcasing the versatility and effectiveness of soft layering.

**The article does not express any positive or negative sentiment towards Itanium**. The focus is entirely on the technical aspect of soft layering and its application across different platforms, including Itanium.  Itanium is simply presented as a platform for demonstrating the technique.

2008-01-01 - Reconstructing control flow in modulo scheduled loops

Article:
Software pipelining is a loop optimization technique used to exploit instruction level parallelism in the loop. EPIC architectures, such as Intel IA-64 (Itanium) provide extensive hardware support for software pipelining to generate compact and highly parallel code. However it transforms explicit conditional branches into implicit control flow based on the information of the guard registers. It is difficult to reconstruct precise control flow from the optimized code. This paper describes an approach to reconstruct implicit control flow in modulo scheduled loops and thereby improve the quality of reverse engineering optimized executables. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through experiment results.  2008 IEEE. .

2008-01-01 - Scientific computing applications on a stream processor

Article:
Stream processors, developed for the stream programming model, perform well on media applications. In this paper we examine the applicability of a stream processor to scientific computing applications. Eight scientific applications, each having different performance characteristics, are mapped to a stream processor. Due to the novelty of the stream programming model, we show how to map programs in a traditional language, such as FORTRAN. In a stream processor system, the management of system resources is the programmers' responsibility. We present several optimizations, which enable mapped programs to exploit various aspects of the stream processor architecture. Finally, we analyze the performance of the stream processor and the presented optimizations on a set of scientific computing applications. The stream programs are from 1.67 to 32.5 times faster than the corresponding FORTRAN programs on an Itanium 2 processor, with the optimizations playing an important role in realizing the performance improvement.  2008 IEEE. .

Article:
We discuss a parallel library of efficient algorithms for the solution of linear-quadratic optimal control problems involving large-scale systems with state-space dimension up to O(104). We survey the numerical algorithms underlying the implementation of the chosen optimal control methods. The approaches considered here are based on invariant and deflating subspace techniques, and avoid the explicit solution of the associated algebraic Riccati equations in case of possible ill-conditioning. Still, our algorithms can also optionally compute the Riccati solution. The major computational task of finding spectral projectors onto the required invariant or deflating subspaces is implemented using iterative schemes for the sign and disk functions. Experimental results report the numerical accuracy and the parallel performance of our approach on a cluster of Intel Itanium-2 processors. .

2009-01-01 - 2DRMP: A suite of two-dimensional R-matrix propagation codes

Article:
The R-matrix method has proved to be a remarkably stable, robust and efficient technique for solving the close-coupling equations that arise in electron and photon collisions with atoms, ions and molecules. During the last thirty-four years a series of related R-matrix program packages have been published periodically in CPC. These packages are primarily concerned with low-energy scattering where the incident energy is insufficient to ionise the target. In this paper we describe 2DRMP, a suite of two-dimensional R-matrix propagation programs aimed at creating virtual experiments on high performance and grid architectures to enable the study of electron scattering from H-like atoms and ions at intermediate energies. Program summary: Program title: 2DRMP. Catalogue identifier: AEEA_v1_0. Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEEA_v1_0.html. Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland. Licensing provisions: Standard CPC licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html. No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 196 717. No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 3 819 727. Distribution format: tar.gz. Programming language: Fortran 95, MPI. Computer: Tested on CRAY XT4 [1]; IBM eServer 575 [2]; Itanium II cluster [3]. Operating system: Tested on UNICOS/lc [1]; IBM AIX [2]; Red Hat Linux Enterprise AS [3]. Has the code been vectorised or parallelised?: Yes. 16 cores were used for small test run. Classification: 2.4. External routines: BLAS, LAPACK, PBLAS, ScaLAPACK. Subprograms used: ADAZ_v1_1. Nature of problem: 2DRMP is a suite of programs aimed at creating virtual experiments on high performance architectures to enable the study of electron scattering from H-like atoms and ions at intermediate energies. Solution method: Two-dimensional R-matrix propagation theory. The (r1, r2) space of the internal region is subdivided into a number of subregions. Local R-matrices are constructed within each subregion and used to propagate a global R-matrix, , across the internal region. On the boundary of the internal region  is transformed onto the IERM target state basis. Thus, the two-dimensional R-matrix propagation technique transforms an intractable problem into a series of tractable problems enabling the internal region to be extended far beyond that which is possible with the standard one-sector codes. A distinctive feature of the method is that both electrons are treated identically and the R-matrix basis states are constructed to allow for both electrons to be in the continuum. The subregion size is flexible and can be adjusted to accommodate the number of cores available. Restrictions: The implementation is currently restricted to electron scattering from H-like atoms and ions. Additional comments: The programs have been designed to operate on serial computers and to exploit the distributed memory parallelism found on tightly coupled high performance clusters and supercomputers. 2DRMP has been systematically and comprehensively documented using ROBODoc [4] which is an API documentation tool that works by extracting specially formatted headers from the program source code and writing them to documentation files. Running time: The wall clock running time for the small test run using 16 cores and performed on [3] is as follows: bp (7 s); rint2 (34 s); newrd (32 s); diag (21 s); amps (11 s); prop (24 s).

2009-01-01 - 3-D brain MRI tissue classification on FPGAs

Article:
Many automatic algorithms have been proposed for analyzing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets. With the increasingly large data sets being used in brain mapping, there has been a significant rise in the need for accelerating these algorithms. Partial volume estimation (PVE), a brain tissue classification algorithm for MRI, was implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based high performance reconfigurable computer using the Mitrion-C high-level language (HLL). This work develops on prior work in which we conducted initial studies on accelerating the prior information estimation algorithm. In this paper, we extend the work to include probability density estimation and present new results and additional analysis. We used several simulated and real human brain MR images to evaluate the accuracy and performance improvement of the proposed algorithm. The FPGA-based probability density estimation and prior information estimation implementation achieved an average speedup over an Itanium 2 CPU of 2.5  and 9.4 , respectively. The overall performance improvement of the FPGA-based PVE algorithm was 5.1  with four FPGAs.  2009 IEEE. .

Article:
Software engineering studies have shown that programmer productivity is improved through the use of computational science integrated development environments (or CSIDE, pronounced "sea side") such as MATLAB. Scientists often desire to use high-performance computing (HPC) systems to run their existing CSIDE scripts with large data sets. ParaM is a CSIDE distribution that provides parallel execution of MATLAB scripts on HPC systems at large shared computer centers. ParaM runs on a range of processor architectures (e.g., x86, x64, Itanium, PowerPC) and its MPI binding, known as bcMPI, supports a number of interconnect architectures (e.g., Myrinet and InfiniBand). On a cluster at Ohio Supercomputer Center, bcMPI with blocking communication has achieved 60% of the bandwidth of an equivalent C/MPI benchmark. In this paper, we describe goals and status for the ParaM project and the development of applications in signal and image processing that use ParaM.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. .

2009-01-01 - A practical approach to hardware performance monitoring based dynamic optimizations in a production JVM

Article:
While the concept of online profile directed dynamic optimizations using hardware performance monitoring unit (PMU) data is not new, it has seen fairly limited or no use in commercial JVMs. The main reason behind this fact is the set of significant challenges involved in (1) obtaining low overhead and usable profiling support from the underlying platform (2) the complexity of filtering, interpreting and using precise PMU events online in a JVM environment (3) demonstrating the total runtime benefit of PMU data based optimizations above and beyond regular online profile based optimizations. In this paper we address all three challenges by presenting a practical framework for PMU data collection and use within a high performance product JVM on a highly scalable server platform. Our experiments with JavaTM workloads using the SunTM HotspotTM JDK 1.6 JVM on the Intel  Itanium  platform indicate that the hardware data collection overhead (less than 0.5%) is not as significant as the challenge of extracting the precise information for optimization purposes. We demonstrate the feasibility of mapping the instruction IP address based hardware event information to the runtime components as well as the JIT server compiler internal data structures for use in optimizations within a dynamic environment. We also evaluated the additional performance potential of optimizations such as object co-location during garbage collection and global instruction scheduling in the JIT compiler with the use of PMU generated load latency information.

Title:
2009-01-01 - A practical approach to hardware performance monitoring based dynamic optimizations in a production JVM

Article:
While the concept of online profile directed dynamic optimizations using hardware performance monitoring unit (PMU) data is not new, it has seen fairly limited or no use in commercial JVMs. The main reason behind this fact is the set of significant challenges involved in (1) obtaining low overhead and usable profiling support from the underlying platform (2) the complexity of filtering, interpreting and using precise PMU events online in a JVM environment (3) demonstrating the total runtime benefit of PMU data based optimizations above and beyond regular online profile based optimizations. In this paper we address all three challenges by presenting a practical framework for PMU data collection and use within a high performance product JVM on a highly scalable server platform. Our experiments with JavaTM workloads using the SunTM HotspotTM JDK 1.6 JVM on the Intel  Itanium  platform indicate that the hardware data collection overhead (less than 0.5%) is not as significant as the challenge of extracting the precise information for optimization purposes. We demonstrate the feasibility of mapping the instruction IP address based hardware event information to the runtime components as well as the JIT server compiler internal data structures for use in optimizations within a dynamic environment. We also evaluated the additional performance potential of optimizations such as object co-location during garbage collection and global instruction scheduling in the JIT compiler with the use of PMU generated load latency information. Experimental results show performance improvements of up to 14% with an average of 2.2% across select Java server benchmarks such as SPECjbb2005[16], SPECjvm2008[17] and Dacapo[18]. These benefits were observed over and above those provided by profile guided server JVM optimizations in the absence of hardware PMU data.  2009 IEEE. .

2009-01-01 - Control flow obfuscation with information flow tracking

Article:
Recent micro-architectural research has proposed various schemes to enhance processors with additional tags to track various properties of a program. Such a technique, which is usually referred to as information flow tracking, has been widely applied to secure software execution (e.g., taint tracking), protect software privacy and improve performance (e.g., control speculation). In this paper, we propose a novel use of information flow tracking to obfuscate the whole control flow of a program with only modest performance degradation, to defeat malicious code injection, discourage software piracy and impede malware analysis. Specifically, we exploit two common features in information flow tracking: the architectural support for automatic propagation of tags and violation handling of tag misuses. Unlike other schemes that use tags as oracles to catch attacks (e.g., taint tracking) or speculation failures, we use the tags as flow-sensitive predicates to hide normal control flow transfers: the tags are used as predicates for control flow transfers to the violation handler, where the real control flow transfer happens. We have implemented a working prototype based on Itanium processors, by leveraging the hardware support for control speculation. Experimental results show that BOSH can obfuscate the whole control flow with only a mean of 26.7% (ranging from 4% to 59%) overhead on SPECINT2006. The increase in code size and compilation time is also modest. Copyright 2009 ACM. .

2009-01-01 - Developing energy efficient filtering systems

Article:
Processing large volumes of information generally requires massive amounts of computational power, which consumes a significant amount of energy. An emerging challenge is the development of "environmentally friendly" systems that are not only efficient in terms of time, but also energy efficient. In this poster, we outline our initial efforts at developing greener filtering systems by employing Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to perform the core information processing task. FPGAs enable code to be executed in parallel at a chip level, while consuming only a fraction of the power of a standard (von Neuman style) processor. On a number of test collections, we demonstrate that the FPGA filtering system performs 10-20 times faster than the Itanium based implementation, resulting in considerable energy savings. .

2009-01-01 - Enabling high-productivity SIP application development: Modeling and simulation of superconducting quantum interference filters

Article:
The inherent complexity in utilizing and programming high performance computing (HPC) systems is the main obstacle to widespread exploitation of HPC resources and technologies in the Department of Defense (DoD). Consequently, there is the persistent need to simplify the programming interface for the generic user. This need is particularly acute in the Signal/Image Processing (SIP), Integrated Modeling and Test Environments (IMT), and related DoD communities where typical users have heterogeneous unconsolidated needs. Mastering the complexity of traditional programming tools (C, MPI, etc.) is often seen as a diversion of energy that could be applied to the study of the given scientific domain. Many SIP users instead prefer high-level languages (HLLs) within integrated development environments, such as MATLAB. We report on our collaborative effort to use a HLL distribution for HPC systems called ParaM to optimize and parallelize a compute-intensive Superconducting Quantum Interference Filter (SQIF) application provided by the Navy SPAWAR Systems Center in San Diego, CA. ParaM is an open-source HLL distribution developed at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC), and includes support for processor architectures not supported by MATLAB (e.g., Itanium and POWER5) as well as support for high-speed interconnects (e.g., InfiniBand and Myrinet). We make use of ParaM installations available at the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) DoD Supercomputing Resource Center (DSRC) and OSC to perform a successful optimization/parallelization of the SQIF application. This optimization/ parallelization may be used to assess the feasibility of using SQIF devices as extremely sensitive detectors for electromagnetic radiation which is of great importance to the Navy and DoD in general.  2010 IEEE. .

2009-01-01 - FARM_2DRMP: A version of FARM for use with 2DRMP

Article:
To complete the 2DRMP package an asymptotic program, such as FARM, is needed. The original version of FARM is designed to construct the physical R-matrix, R, from surface amplitudes contained in the H-file. However, in 2DRMP, R has already been constructed for each scattering energy during propagation. Therefore, this modified version of FARM, known as FARM_2DRMP, has been developed solely for use with 2DRMP. New version program summary: Program title: FARM_2DRMP. Catalogue identifier: ADAZ_v1_1. Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADAZ_v1_1.html. Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland. Licensing provisions: Standard CPC licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html. No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 13 806. No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 134 462. Distribution format: tar.gz. Programming language: Fortran 95 and MPI. Computer: Tested on CRAY XT4 [1]; IBM eServer 575 [2]; Itanium II cluster [3]. Operating system: Tested on UNICOS/lc [1]; IBM AIX [2]; Red Hat Linux Enterprise AS [3]. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes. 16 cores were used for the small test run. Classification: 2.4. External routines: BLAS, LAPACK. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: No. Nature of problem: The program solves the scattering problem in the asymptotic region of R-matrix theory where exchange is negligible. Solution method: A radius is determined at which the wave function, calculated as a Gailitis expansion [4] with accelerated summing [5] over terms, converges. The R-matrix is propagated from the boundary of the internal region to this radius and the K-matrix calculated. Collision strengths or cross sections may be calculated. Reasons for new version: To complete the 2DRMP package [6] an asymptotic program, such as FARM [7], is needed. The original version of FARM is designed to construct the physical R-matrix, R, from surface amplitudes contained in the H-file. However, in 2DRMP, R, has already been constructed for each scattering energy during propagation and each R is stored in one of the RmatT files described in Fig. 8 of [6]. Therefore, this modified version of FARM, known as FARM_2DRMP, has been developed solely for use with 2DRMP. Instructions on its use and corresponding test data is provided with 2DRMP [6]. Summary of revisions: FARM_2DRMP contains two codes, farm.f and farm_par.f90. The former is a serial code while the latter is a parallel F95 code that employs an MPI harness to enable the nenergy energies to be computed simultaneously across ncore cores, with each core processing either  nenergy / ncore  or  nenergy / ncore  energies. The input files, input.d and H, and the output file farm.out are as described in [7]. Both codes read R directly from RmatT. Restrictions: FARM_2DRMP is for use solely with 2DRMP and for a specified L, S and  combination. The energy range specified in input.d must match that specified in energies.data. Running time: The wall clock running time for the small test run using 16 cores and performed on [3] is 9 secs.

Title:
2009-01-01 - FPC: A high-speed compressor for double-precision floating-point data

Article:
Many scientific programs exchange large quantities of double-precision data between processing nodes and with mass storage devices. Data compression can reduce the number of bytes that need to be transferred and stored. However, compression is only likely to be employed in high-end computing environments if it does not impede the throughput. This paper describes and evaluates FPC, a fast lossless compression algorithm for linear streams of 64-bit floating-point data. FPC works well on hard-to-compress scientific datasets and meets the throughput demands of high-performance systems. A comparison with five lossless compression schemes, BZIP2, DFCM, FSD, GZIP, and PLMI, on four architectures and thirteen datasets shows that FPC compresses and decompresses one to two orders of magnitude faster than the other algorithms at the same geometric-mean compression ratio. Moreover, FPC provides a guaranteed throughput as long as the prediction tables fit into the L1 data cache. For example, on a 1.6 GHz Itanium 2 server, the throughput is 670 megabytes per second regardless of what data are being compressed.  2008 IEEE. .

2009-01-01 - Implementing fast packet filters by software pipelining on x86 processors

Article:
Packet filters are essential for network traffic/security management on the Internet. Filters implemented by software on general-purpose CPUs are very flexible but occasionally suffer from poor performance. In order to address this problem, we have investigated software pipelining techniques for loops with a number of conditional branches for use in software-based fast packet filters. Based on our previous researches, we herein apply the software pipelining approach in an attempt to increase the filter performance for large filter rules. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on Intel x86-32/64 series, as well as Intel Itanium 2 processors, which speaks to the generality and practicality of the proposed approach. The software pipelined program codes on x86-64 processors are 2.2 times faster than C-compiler-based codes and 1.8 times faster than carefully optimized hand-compiled codes. In addition, the performance of the pipelined codes we obtained on x86-64 processors is comparable to that on Itanium 2 processors with predicate registers.  2009 Springer. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on improving the performance of packet filters, which are critical for network security and management. The authors specifically target the challenge of inefficient filtering due to conditional branches in software-based implementations. Their proposed solution is software pipelining, a technique aimed at optimizing loop execution by overlapping instructions.

**Itanium's Role:**

The article acknowledges Itanium 2 processors' unique feature of predicate registers, which are designed to efficiently handle conditional branches. They use this feature as a benchmark to compare the performance of their software pipelined codes on x86-64 processors. 

**Sentiment Towards Itanium:**

The article does not explicitly criticize Itanium 2, nor does it promote it. However, the authors highlight the performance achieved on x86-64 processors using software pipelining, which is comparable to that of Itanium 2 with predicate registers. This implies that their optimization technique on x86-64 architecture is as effective as Itanium 2's specific hardware feature for handling conditional branches.

**Sentiment Score:**

Given that the authors use Itanium 2 as a reference point for performance comparison, but do not explicitly express a preference for either architecture, the sentiment towards Itanium 2 leans towards neutrality. 

**[0] - Neutral**

2009-01-01 - Improving performance of optimized kernels through fast instantiations of templates

Article:
To fully exploit the instruction-level parallelism offered by modern processors, compilers need the necessary information available during the execution of the program. This advocates for iterative or dynamic compilation. Unfortunately, dynamic compilation is suitable only for applications where the cost of compilation may be amortized by multiple invocations of the same code. Similarly, the cost of iterative compilation makes it impractical to be widely used for performance improvement. In this article, we suggest a novel approach for improving the performance of mathematical kernels through fast instantiations of templates. Optimized templates are generated at static compile time with a limited number of compilations. The initial instantiations of these templates are performed at static compile time, and the runtime instantiations are performed with a very small overhead through specialized data, requiring no computations at runtime. It represents an effective solution in terms of reduced overhead incurring at static compile time and dynamic compile time. The experiments have been performed on an Itanium-II architecture using highly optimized kernels of ATLAS and FFTW with ice and gcc compilers. Copyright  2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on improving the performance of mathematical kernels, specifically by leveraging template instantiation techniques. It argues that traditional dynamic and iterative compilation methods are too costly for widespread use. The authors propose a novel approach that involves pre-generating optimized templates at compile time and then performing fast instantiations at runtime with minimal overhead. This allows for efficient code specialization without the performance penalty associated with dynamic compilation.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article mentions Itanium-II architecture as the platform for their experiments.  It does not directly express any positive or negative opinions about Itanium.  Instead, Itanium is used as a testing ground to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed technique. The authors use Itanium-II to showcase how their method, when applied to highly optimized kernels from ATLAS and FFTW (libraries widely used for numerical computation), can achieve significant performance gains. 

**Sentiment Score:** [0] - Neutral 

**Explanation:**

While the article uses Itanium-II for its experiments, it does not express any explicit sentiment towards the architecture. The focus remains solely on the proposed technique and its performance benefits, making the mention of Itanium-II purely functional and devoid of any evaluative judgment.

2009-01-01 - Legacy computer systems migration

Article:
Many legacy systems designed more than ten years ago are performing their functions more than adequately, however, the hardware/software platforms may no longer be available or supported. The initial cost that would be incurred to re-design these systems to work on the standard platforms of today cannot be cost justified. More importantly, many of these systems did not perform adequately after their initial implementation and companies invested a substantial amount of time and effort into the evolution of these systems, making them as robust and reliable as they are today. Much of these ongoing software maintenance costs, operational downtime, and poor quality issues would again be incurred after a re-design effort. The impact of these issues can be greatly reduced by porting to compatible systems that are available and supported today. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article Regarding Itanium

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

This article discusses the challenges of migrating legacy computer systems, particularly those built on older platforms like VAX and OpenVMS, which are no longer supported. The article argues that re-designing these systems to work on modern platforms is not cost-effective, especially considering the extensive effort already invested in their development and optimization. Instead, it advocates for porting these legacy systems to compatible, currently supported systems.

**Sentiment Towards Itanium:**

The article **does not explicitly mention Itanium**, nor does it express any direct opinion about it.  The focus is on the general challenges of legacy system migration and the potential benefits of porting them to compatible platforms, without specifically identifying these platforms.

**Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium is [0] Neutral.** 

**Explanation:**

* The article focuses on the challenges of migrating legacy systems built on platforms like VAX and OpenVMS, not on Itanium.
* It mentions that many legacy systems are "performing their functions more than adequately," implying that they are not inherently problematic, regardless of their platform.
* The article emphasizes the costs and risks associated with re-designing these systems, but does not explicitly connect these issues with Itanium.
* While the article mentions the desire for "compatible systems that are available and supported today," it doesn't specify whether Itanium falls under that category or not. 

Therefore, the article's focus is on the general challenges of legacy system migration and doesn't provide enough information to determine any specific sentiment towards Itanium.

2009-01-01 - Matrix-based streamization approach for improving locality and parallelism on FT64 stream processor

Article:
FT64 is the first 64-bit stream processor designed for scientific computing. It is critical to exploit optimizing streamization approaches for scientific applications on FT64 due to the inefficiency of direct streamization approach. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix-based streamization approach for improving locality and parallelism of scientific applications on FT64. First, a Data&Computation Matrix is built to abstract the relationship between loops and arrays of the original programs, and it is helpful for formulating the streamization problem. Second, three key techniques for optimizing streamization approach are proposed based on the transformations of the matrix, i.e., coarse-grained program transformations, fine-grained program transformations, and stream organization optimizations. Finally, we apply our approach to ten typical scientific application kernels on FT64. The experimental results show that the matrix-based streamization approach achieves an average speedup of 2.76 over the direct streamization approach, and performs equally to or better than the corresponding Fortran programs on Itanium 2 except CG. It is certain that the matrix-based streamization approach is a promising and practical solution to efficiently exploit the tremendous potential of FT64.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. .

2009-01-01 - Parallel coupling of heterogeneous domains with KOP3D using PACX-MPI

Article:
This paper outlines how coupled heterogeneous domains can be distributed in a supercomputing environment using PACX-MPI. KOP3D is a coupling program in the field of aero acoustics, a typical multi-scale application, since on the one hand it has to account for the small vortical structures as the source of the noise and on the other for the long wave length of the acoustic waves. The amount of energy, and with that the pressure, in the sound generating flow is by orders of magnitude higher than the amount of energy carried by the acoustic waves. The acoustical wavelength is much larger than the diameter of the noise-generating vortices, and even the computational domains may vary in a wide range from the geometry which is in the order of meters for an airfoil to the distance between a starting or landing plan and the observer on the ground which is in the order of about 1 km. Through the use of heterogeneous domain decomposition it is possible to reduce the computation time needed to simulate large flow fields by adaptation of the equations, the discretization, the mesh and the time step to the local requirements of the flow simulation within each sub-domain. These locally adapted computations may result in different requirements on the computer architecture. On the other side, in a supercomputing network there are generally different computer architectures available. By matching the sub-domains to the best suited available architectures an even shorter time to solution may be gained. The parallel version of the KOP3D coupling scheme is shown and the benefits of running the simulation distributed on the vector machine NEC-SX8 and on the scalar Itanium II (IA64) machine are demonstrated.

2009-01-01 - Reconfigurable sparse/dense matrix-vector multiplier

Article:
We propose an ANSI/IEEE-754 double precision floating-point matrix-vector multiplier. Its main feature is the capability to process efficiently both Dense Matrix-Vector Multiplications (DMVM) and Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplications (SMVM). The design is composed of multiple processing elements (PE) and is optimized for FPGAs. We investigate theoretically the boundary conditions when the DMVM equals the SMVM performance with respect to the matrix sparsity. Thus, we can determine the most efficient processing mode configuration with respect to the input data sparsity. Furthermore, we evaluate our design both with simulations and on real hardware. We experimented on an Altix 450 machine using the SGI Reconfigurable Application Specific Computing (RASC) services, which couple Dual-Core Itanium-2 processors with Virtex-4 LX200 FPGAs. Our design has been routed and executed on the Altix 450 machine at 100 MHz. Experimental results suggest that only two PEs suffice to outperform the pure software SMVM execution. The performance improvement at the kernel level scales near linearly to the number of configured PEs both for the SMVM and DMVM. Compared to related work, the design does not indicate any performance degradation and performs equally or better than designs optimized either for SMVM or DMVM alone.  2009 IEEE. .

## Sentiment Analysis of Itanium in the Article

The article focuses on the development and performance evaluation of a reconfigurable hardware accelerator for both dense and sparse matrix-vector multiplications (DMVM and SMVM).  The main goal is to demonstrate the efficiency of this design in handling varying sparsity levels in matrices and achieve performance improvements compared to traditional software implementations. 

**Here's how Itanium is discussed in the article:**

* **Hardware platform:** The article mentions that the design was evaluated on an Altix 450 machine equipped with "Dual-Core Itanium-2 processors" coupled with Virtex-4 LX200 FPGAs. This clearly identifies Itanium as the processor used for the evaluation.
* **Execution:** The article states that the design was "routed and executed on the Altix 450 machine at 100 MHz." This implies the authors used Itanium processors for running their design and measuring its performance.
* **Performance comparison:** The article compares the performance of the hardware accelerator against "pure software SMVM execution," suggesting the software implementation was running on the Itanium processors. It states that "only two PEs suffice to outperform the pure software SMVM execution," indicating the hardware accelerator achieves better performance than the software counterpart on Itanium.

**However, the article does not specifically express any opinion or sentiment about Itanium itself.**  It focuses solely on the hardware accelerator's performance and doesn't delve into the merits or drawbacks of the Itanium processor. 

**Therefore, the article's sentiment towards Itanium is neutral.**  The article simply uses Itanium as the platform for evaluating their design.

**Sentiment Score:** [0]

2009-01-01 - Seven-O'clock: A new distributed GVT algorithm using network atomic operations

Article:
In this paper we introduce a new concept, Network Atomic Operations (NAOs) to create a zero-cost consistent cut. Using NAOs, we define a wall clock time driven Global Virtual Time (GVT) algorithm called The Seven O'clock GVT algorithm that is an extension of Fujimoto's shared memory GVT algorithm. Using this new GVT algorithm, we report good optimistic parallel performance on a cluster of Itanium-II quad processor systems as well as a dated cluster of 40 dual Pentium III systems for both benchmark applications such as PHOLD and real-world applications such as a large-scale TCP/IP internet model. In some cases, super-linear speedup is observed. The Seven O'clock GVT algorithm greatly simplifies processor synchronisation by creating a zero-cost 'consistent cut' across the distributed simulation. Copyright  2009, Inderscience Publishers. .

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article:

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article introduces a new distributed GVT (Global Virtual Time) algorithm called "The Seven O'clock GVT algorithm," designed to improve the performance of optimistic parallel simulations. The algorithm utilizes "Network Atomic Operations" (NAOs) to achieve a zero-cost consistent cut, simplifying processor synchronization. The authors demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on two different hardware platforms: a cluster of Itanium-II quad processor systems and a cluster of 40 dual Pentium III systems.

**Sentiment towards Itanium:**

The article does not explicitly express any negative sentiment towards Itanium. Instead, it mentions Itanium-II quad processor systems as a target platform for testing the new GVT algorithm, alongside a cluster of Pentium III systems. It then states that the algorithm "reports good optimistic parallel performance" on both platforms. This suggests that the authors consider Itanium-II a relevant and suitable platform for testing and showcasing the capabilities of their algorithm. 

**Conclusion:**

While the article does not explicitly praise Itanium, the fact that it is mentioned as a platform for testing the algorithm, alongside another platform, suggests that the authors view Itanium-II as a viable and capable system for parallel computing. The positive performance results reported on Itanium-II further reinforce this notion.

**Sentiment Score: [1] - Somewhat Positive**

2009-01-01 - Vine - A numerical code for simulating astrophysical systems using particles. I. Description of the physics and the numerical methods

Article:
We present a numerical code for simulating the evolution of astrophysical systems using particles to represent the underlying fluid flow. The code is written in Fortran 95 and is designed to be versatile, flexible, and extensible, with modular options that can be selected either at the time the code is compiled or at run time through a text input file. We include a number of general purpose modules describing a variety of physical processes commonly required in the astrophysical community and we expect that the effort required to integrate additional or alternate modules into the code will be small. In its simplest form the code can evolve the dynamical trajectories of a set of particles in two or three dimensions using a module which implements either a Leapfrog or Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg integrator, selected by the user at compile time. The user may choose to allow the integrator to evolve the system using individual time steps for each particle or with a single, global time step for all. Particles may interact gravitationally as N-body particles, and all or any subset may also interact hydrodynamically, using the smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) method by selecting the SPH module. A third particle species can be included with a module to model massive point particles which may accrete nearby SPH or N-body particles. Such particles may be used to model, e.g., stars in a molecular cloud. Free boundary conditions are implemented by default, and a module may be selected to include periodic boundary conditions. We use a binary "Press" tree to organize particles for rapid access in gravity and SPH calculations. Modules implementing an interface with special purpose "GRAPE" hardware may also be selected to accelerate the gravity calculations. If available, forces obtained from the GRAPE coprocessors may be transparently substituted for those obtained from the tree, or both tree and GRAPE may be used as a combination GRAPE/tree code. The code may be run without modification on single processors or in parallel using OpenMP compiler directives on large-scale, shared memory parallel machines. We present simulations of several test problems, including a merger simulation of two elliptical galaxies with 800,000 particles. In comparison to the Gadget-2 code of Springel, the gravitational force calculation, which is the most costly part of any simulation including self-gravity, is 4.6-4.9 times faster with VINE when tested on different snapshots of the elliptical galaxy merger simulation when run on an Itanium 2 processor in an SGI Altix. A full simulation of the same setup with eight processors is a factor of 2.91 faster with VINE. The code is available to the public under the terms of the Gnu General Public License.  2009.

2010-01-01 - A method for debugging of pipelined processors in formal verification by correspondence checking

Article:
Presented is a method for debugging of pipelined processors in their formal verification with the highly automatic and scalable approach of Correspondence Checking, where a pipelined/superscalar/VLIW implementation is compared against a non-pipelined specification via an inductive correctness criterion based on symbolic simulation in a way that guarantees the correctness of the implementation for all possible execution scenarios. The benefit from the proposed method increases with the complexity of the processor under formal verification. For a 12-stage VLIW processor that imitates the Intel Itanium in many features, the method reduced the size of the EUFM correctness formulas from buggy processors by up to an order of magnitude, the number of Boolean variables in the equivalent propositional correctness formulas and the number of 1s in the counterexample traces by up to 2 orders of magnitude, and resulted in an average speedup in detecting the bugs of 2 orders of magnitude, thus increasing the productivity of the processor designers. .

Article:
We present a new scheme for evaluating the performance of multithreaded computers and demonstrate its application to the Cray MTA-2 and XMT supercomputers. Our scheme is based on the concept of clock cycles per element,C, plotted against both problem size and the number of processors. This scheme clearly shows if an implementation has achieved its asymptotic efficiency and is more general than (but includes) the commonly used speedup metric. It permits the discovery of any imperfections in both the software as well as the hardware, and is expected to permit a unified comparison of many different parallel architectures. Measurements on a number of well-known parallel algorithms, ranging from matrix multiply to quicksort, are presented for the MTA-2 and XMT and highlight some interesting differences between these machines. The performance of sequence alignment using dynamic programming is evaluated on the MTA-2, XMT, IBM x3755 and SGI Altix 350 and provides a useful comparison of the capabilities of the Cray machines with more conventional shared memory architectures. .

With the complexity of contemporary single- and multi-core, multi-threaded processors comes a greater need for faster methods of performance analysis and design. It is no longer practical to use only cycle-accurate processor simulators for design space analysis of modern processors and systems. Therefore, we propose a statistical processor modeling method that is based on Monte Carlo techniques. In this paper, we present new details of the methodology and the recent extensions that we have made to it, including the capability to model multi-core processors.We detail the steps to develop a new model and then present statistical performance models of the Sun Niagara 2 processor micro-architecture that, together with a previously published Itanium 2 Monte Carlo model, demonstrates the validity of the technique and its new capabilities. We show that we can accurately predict single and multi-core performance within 7% of actual on average, and we can use the models to quickly pinpoint performance problems at various components.  2010 IEEE. .

2010-01-01 - Feedback-directed specialization of code

Article:
Based on feedback information, a large number of optimizations can be performed by the compiler. This information actually indicates the changing behavior of the applications and can be used to specialize code accordingly. Code specialization is a way to facilitate the compiler to perform optimizations by providing the information regarding variables in the code. It is however difficult to select the variables which maximize the benefit of specialization. Also the overhead of specialization and code size increase are the main issues while specializing code. This paper suggests a novel method for improving the performance using specialization based on feedback information and analysis. The code is iteratively specialized after selecting candidate variables by using a heuristic, followed by generation of optimized templates. These templates require a limited set of instructions to be specialized at runtime and are valid for a large number of values. The overhead of runtime specialization is further minimized through optimal software cache of template clones whose instantiation can be performed at static compile time. The experiments have been performed on Itanium-II(IA-64) and Pentium-IV processors using icc and gcc compilers. A significant improvement in terms of execution speed and reduction of code size has been achieved for SPEC and FFTW benchmarks.  2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. .

2010-01-01 - Formal verification of object layout for C++ multiple inheritance

Article:
Object layout - the concrete in-memory representation of objects - raises many delicate issues in the case of the C++ language, owing in particular to multiple inheritance, C compatibility and separate compilation. This paper formalizes a family of C++ object layout schemes and mechanically proves their correctness against the operational semantics for multiple inheritance of Wasserrab et al. This formalization is flexible enough to account for space-saving techniques such as empty base class optimization and tail-padding optimization. As an application, we obtain the first formal correctness proofs for realistic, optimized object layout algorithms, including one based on the popular "common vendor" Itanium C++ application binary interface. This work provides semantic foundations to discover and justify new layout optimizations; it is also a first step towards the verification of a C++ compiler frontend. Copyright  2011 ACM. .

2010-01-01 - Newton-Raphson algorithms for floating-point division using an FMA

Article:
Since the introduction of the Fused Multiply and Add (FMA) in the IEEE-754-2008 standard [6] for floating-point arithmetic, division based on Newton-Raphson's iterations becomes a viable alternative to SRT-based divisions. The Newton-Raphson iterations were already used in some architecture prior to the revision of the IEEE-754 norm. For example, Itanium architecture already used this kind of iterations [8].

## Analyzing the Sentiment Towards Itanium

The article focuses on the use of Newton-Raphson iterations for floating-point division, particularly in the context of the newly standardized FMA (Fused Multiply and Add) operation. The paper aims to:

1. **Highlight the viability of Newton-Raphson iterations for division algorithms:**  The authors emphasize that with the introduction of FMA, Newton-Raphson methods become a competitive alternative to traditional SRT-based division methods.
2. **Address the challenge of proving the correctness of algorithms:** The paper notes that existing proofs for binary algorithms do not automatically extend to decimal floating-point arithmetic. The authors then present "general methods" to prove the correct rounding of Newton-Raphson based division algorithms, covering both radix-2 and radix-10 floating-point systems.

**Regarding Itanium:**

The article mentions Itanium as an example of an architecture that **already implemented Newton-Raphson iterations for division**. This is presented as a **positive example**, indicating that Itanium was at the forefront of adopting these techniques. However, the focus quickly shifts to the **general methods** for proving correctness, **not specific implementations**.

**Overall Sentiment:**

The article mentions Itanium in a **positive light** as a **pioneering architecture** that utilized Newton-Raphson iterations for division. However, the main focus is on the general applicability of the method, not on specific architectures. Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium is **neutral** in the broader context of the paper.

2010-01-01 - Radiation hardened by design SRAM strategies for TID and SEE mitigation

Article:
Static random access memory (SRAM) is ubiquitous in modern system-on-a-chip (SOC) integrated circuits (ICs). Due to its value in programmable systems by providing fast scratchpad memory in embedded and real-time applications as well as space for large working sets in microprocessor designs, IC SRAM content continues to grow. As ICs surpass 1 billion transistors, and given the high relative design and power efficiency of memory arrays compared with random logic, SRAM is projected to comprise 90% of the total die area by 2013 [1]. For instance, the Itanium processor has progressed from 6 MB and 9 MB L3 caches on 130 nm fabrication processes to 24 MB caches on the 65 nm technology generation [2-4]. The Xeon processors include 16 MB caches [5]. Consequently, ICs designed for space and other radiation environments require robust SRAM designs if they are to track the size and performance of commercial ICs.  2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. .

2010-01-01 - Software-implemented fault injection at firmware level

Article:
Software-implemented fault injection is an established method to emulate hardware faults in computer systems. Existing approaches typically extend the operating system by special drivers or change the application under test. We propose a novel approach where fault injection capabilities are added to the computer firmware. This approach can work without any modification to operating system and / or applications, and can support a larger variety of fault locations. We discuss four different strategies in X86/X64 and Itanium systems. Our analysis shows that such an approach can increase portability, the non-intrusiveness of the injector implementation, and the number of supported fault locations. Firmware-level fault injection paves the way for new research directions, such as virtual machine monitor fault injection or the investigation of certified operating systems.  2010 IEEE. .

The core argument presented is that by embedding fault injection capabilities directly into the computer's **firmware**, researchers can bypass the need to modify operating systems or applications. This approach, according to the authors, offers several advantages:

* **Increased portability**: The fault injection mechanism is independent of the specific operating system or application.
* **Non-intrusiveness**: No changes are required in the operating system or applications.
* **Wider range of fault locations**: The firmware-level approach allows for more diverse fault injection scenarios.

**Itanium's Role:** The article specifically mentions Itanium systems alongside X86/X64 architectures as platforms where this firmware-level fault injection technique can be implemented. The authors discuss four different strategies for realizing this approach on both architectures.

**Sentiment:** While the article doesn't explicitly praise or criticize Itanium, it does include it as a **viable target platform** for their proposed fault injection technique. This indicates that the authors consider Itanium a **suitable platform** for this type of research. They acknowledge its relevance and actively explore its potential for fault injection alongside X86/X64.

**Sentiment Score:** [1] - Somewhat positive. 

The article demonstrates a neutral to positive sentiment towards Itanium by actively including it as a target platform for their proposed research. This implies a level of support and recognition of Itanium's capabilities, even if it's not explicitly stated.

Article:
For predicated code a number of predicate analysis systems have been developed like PHG, PQA or PAS. In optimizing compilers for (fully) predicated architectures like the Itanium 2 processor, the primary application for such systems is global register allocation. This paper classifies predicated live ranges into four types, develops strategies based on classical dataflow analysis to allocate register candidates for all classes efficiently, and shows that the simplest strategy can achieve the performance potential provided by a PQS-based implementation. The gain achieved in the Intel production compiler for the CINT2006 integer benchmarks is up to 37.6% and 4.48% in the geomean.  2010 Springer-Verlag. .

2010-01-01 - Synthesis of a unified unit for evaluating an application-specific set of elementary functions

Article:
Fast and accurate evaluation of elementary functions (e.g. 1/x , log, 3x, and 1/x) is vital in many computation intensive applications. This paper presents a synthesis system of a unified hardware unit for evaluating a custom subset of elementary functions. Based on some latest algorithms of software library and new design principles that exploit the parallelism of reconfigurable hardware, fast and compact datapath is automatically generated. The proposed system also enables rapid design space exploration by allowing designers to modify the constraints on each function (e.g. precision, delay, area, etc.). For an arbitrary set of logarithm functions and power series, accuracy around 0.6 ulp (unit of last place) is achieved at double precision, which is 0.3 ulp more accurate than Pentium, and the speed is 30% faster than Itanium. The result is simulated by 80nm process.  2010 IEEE. .

Article:
The next generation in the Intel Itanium processor family, code named Poulson, has eight multi-threaded 64 bit cores. Poulson is socket compatible with the current Intel Itanium Processor 9300 series (Tukwila) [1]. The new design integrates a ring-based system interface derived from portions of previous Xeon and Itanium processors, and includes 32MB of Last Level Cache (LLC). The processor is designed in Intel's 32nm CMOS technology utilizing high-K dielectric metal gate transistors [2] combined with nine layers of copper interconnect. The 18.229.9mm2 die contains 3.1 billion transistors, with 720 million allocated to the eight cores (Fig. 4.8.1). A total of 54MB of on die cache is distributed throughout the core and system interface. Poulson implements twice as many cores as Tukwila while lowering the thermal design power (TDP) by 15W to 170W and increases the top frequency of the I/O and memory interfaces by 50% to 6.4GT/s.  2011 IEEE. .

2011-01-01 - Data cache prefetching with dynamic adaptation

Article:
Modern processors based on VLIW architecture rely heavily on software cache prefetching incorporated by the compiler. For accurate prefetching different factors such as latencies of the loop iterations need to be taken into account, which cannot be determined at (static) compile time. Consequently, the compilers either produce inaccurate prefetches or resort to producing code without prefetching. Many applications with complex code are therefore unable to perform very well on the modern processors. In this paper, we present an approach that is able to generate accurate prefetch instructions by exploiting information available at runtime. The code is instrumented with prefetches having offsets which may be adapted at runtime through a dynamic code specializer. Such cache prefetching with dynamic adaptation results in better performance of the applications. The runtime code generation activity is highly efficient and incurs a very small overhead. The experiments performed on Itanium-II architecture using icc and gcc compilers produce an average speedup of 2.51% and 2.56%, respectively.  The Author 2010.

2011-01-01 - Energy-aware partitioned fixed-priority scheduling for chip multi-processors

Article:
Energy management is becoming an increasingly important problem in application domains ranging from embedded devices to data centers. In many such sys- tems, multi-core processors are projected as a promis- ing technology to achieve improved performance with a lower power envelope. Managing the application power consumption under timing constraints poses significant challenges in these emerging platforms. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient scheduling of periodic real- time tasks with implicit deadlines on chip multi-core processors (CMPs). We specifically consider processors with a single voltage and clock frequency domain, such as the state-of-the-art embedded multi-core NVIDIA Tegra 2 processor and enterprise-class processors such as Intel's Itanium 2, i5, i7 and IBM's Power 6 and Power 7 series. The major contributions of this work are (i) we prove that Worst-Fit-Decreasing (WFD) task parti- tioning when Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) is used has an approximation ratio of 1.71 for the problem of minimizing the schedulable operating frequency with partitioned fixed-priority scheduling, (ii) we illustrate the major shortcoming of WFD with RMS resulting from not considering task periods during allocation, and (iii) we propose a Single-clock domain multi-processor Frequency Assignment Algorithm (SFAA) that determines a globally energy-efficient frequency while including task period relationships. Our evaluation results show that SFAA provides significant energy gains when compared to WFD. In fact SFAA is shown to save up to 55% more power compared to WFD for an octa-core processor.  2011 IEEE. .

2011-01-01 - Formal verification of object layout for C++ multiple inheritance

Article:
Object layout-the concrete in-memory representation of objects-raises many delicate issues in the case of the C++ language, owing in particular to multiple inheritance, C compatibility and separate compilation. This paper formalizes a family of C++ object layout schemes and mechanically proves their correctness against the operational semantics for multiple inheritance of Wasserrab et al. This formalization is flexible enough to account for spacesaving techniques such as empty base class optimization and tailpadding optimization. As an application, we obtain the first formal correctness proofs for realistic, optimized object layout algorithms, including one based on the popular "common vendor" Itanium C++ application binary interface. This work provides semantic foundations to discover and justify new layout optimizations; it is also a first step towards the verification of a C++ compiler frontend.  2011 ACM. .

2011-01-01 - Hardware accelerated design of millimeter wave antireflective surfaces: A comparison of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and graphics processing unit (GPU) implementations

Article:
Engineered materials that demonstrate a specific response to electromagnetic energy incident on them in antenna and radio frequency component design applications are in high demand due to both military and commercial needs. The design of such engineered materials typically requires numerically intensive computations to simulate their behavior as they may have electrically small features on a large area or often the overall system performance is required, which means modeling the entire integrated system. Furthermore, to achieve an optimal performance these simulations need to be run many times until a desired solution is achieved, presenting a major hindrance in arriving at a feasible solution in a reasonable amount of time. One example of such applications is the design of antireflective (AR) surfaces at millimeter wave frequencies, which often involves sub-wavelength gratings in an electrically large multilayer structure. This paper investigates the use of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) as coprocessors to the CPU in order to expedite the computation time. Preliminary results show that the hardware implementation (100 MHz) on Xilinx Virtex4LX200 FPGA is able to outperform a single-thread software implementation on Intel Itanium 2 processor (1.66 GHz) by 20 folds. However, the performance of the FPGA implementation lags behind the single-thread implementation on a modern Xeon (2.26 GHz) by 3.6. On the other hand, modern GPUs demonstrate an evident advantage over both CPU and FPGA by achieving 20 speedup than the Xeon processor.  2011 ACES. .

The article compares the performance of various hardware implementations with a single-thread software implementation on an Intel Itanium 2 processor. Notably, the Itanium 2 processor is only mentioned in the context of the FPGA implementation's performance. 

- **Positive:** The FPGA implementation is stated to be 20 times faster than the Itanium 2 single-thread software implementation. This suggests a favorable comparison, highlighting the FPGA's superior speed. 
- **Negative:** However, the article immediately follows this by stating that the FPGA's performance is 3.6 times slower than a modern Xeon processor. This comparison implicitly diminishes the Itanium 2's performance in relation to newer CPU technology. 

**Sentiment Score:**

While the article initially showcases a positive comparison between the FPGA and Itanium 2, the subsequent comparison with the Xeon processor significantly weakens this positive sentiment. This shift in focus towards the newer Xeon technology leaves a negative impression regarding the Itanium 2's capabilities. Therefore, the overall sentiment towards Itanium is **[-1] - Signs of critique.**  The article doesn't directly attack Itanium, but its performance is implied to be inferior to modern CPU technologies, creating a sense of skepticism and indirect negativity.

2011-01-01 - Improving performance through deep value profiling and specialization with code transformation

Article:
Specialization of code is used to improve the performance of the applications. However, specialization based on ineffective profiles deteriorates the performance. Existing value profiling algorithms are not yet able to address the issue of code size explosion incurred due to specialization of code. This problem can be mitigated by capturing data through profiling that would be useful for specialization of code with minimum code size. In this article, we present an approach to optimize code through value profiling and specialization with code transformation. The values of the parameters selected through an analysis of code are captured in the intervals which are automatically adapted to dynamic behavior of the application. The code is then specialized based on value profiles. The specialized code contains optimizations and may be converted back to the generalized code through a transformation. This approach facilitates the code to obtain optimizations through specialization with minimum size, and no runtime overhead. Using this approach, the experiments performed on Itanium-II (IA-64) architecture with icc compiler v 9.0 show a significant improvement in the performance of the SPEC 2000 benchmarks.  2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2012-01-01 - Hardware counters based analysis of memory accesses in SMPs

Article:
Modern microprocessors incorporate Hardware Counters (HC) that provide useful information with low overhead. HC are not commonly used because of the lack of tools to get their information in an easy way. In this paper, a set of tools to simplify the accessing and programming of Intel Itanium 2 TMEARs (Event Address Registers) is presented. The aim of these tools is to characterise the memory accesses of parallel codes, in multicore systems, in which the cache hierarchy can greatly influence the performance. The first tool allows the user to insert in the code, in a simple and transparent way, the instructions needed to monitor and manage hardware counters. Two versions of this tool have been implemented. The first one is a command line tool that takes as input a C source file with appropriate directives and outputs it with the monitoring code added. The other one is a graphical interface that allows the user to select the parts of the code to analise. The second tool takes the information gathered by the monitored parallel code provided by the hardware counters and displays it graphically. This tool shows the information in a comprehensive but simple way, allowing the user to adjust the level of detail. These tools were used to carry out a study of parallel irregular codes. Although this study has been made in a specific environment, the tools here presented can be used in any system as long as it is based on hardware counters present in current processors.  2012 IEEE. .

2012-01-01 - SMARQ: Software-managed alias register queue for dynamic optimizations

Article:
Traditional alias analysis is expensive and ineffective for dynamic optimizations. In practice, dynamic optimization systems perform memory optimizations speculatively, and rely on hardware, such as alias registers, to detect memory aliases at runtime. Existing hardware alias detection schemes either cannot scale up to a large number of alias registers or may introduce false positives. Order-based alias detection overcomes the limitations. However, it brings considerable challenges as how software can efficiently manage the alias register queue and impose restrictions on optimizations. In this paper, we present SMARQ, a Software-Managed Alias Register Queue, which manages the alias register queue efficiently and supports more aggressive speculative optimizations. We conducted experiments with a dynamic optimization system on a VLIW processor that has 64 alias registers. The experiments on a suite of SPECFP2000 benchmarks show that SMARQ improves the overall performance by 39% as compared to the case without hardware alias detection. By scaling up to a large number (from 16 to 64) of alias registers, SMARQ improves performance by 10%. Compared to a technique with false positives (similar to Itanium), SMARQ improves performance by 13%. To reduce the chance of alias register overflow, the novel alias register allocation algorithm in SMARQ reduces the alias register working set by 74% as compared to a straightforward alias register allocation based on program order.  2012 IEEE. .

## Analyzing the Sentiment of the Article Towards Itanium

**Topic/Goal of the Article:**

The article focuses on the challenge of dynamic optimizations, specifically memory optimizations, in the context of high-performance computing. It highlights the shortcomings of traditional alias analysis and the limitations of existing hardware-based alias detection schemes.  The core contribution is the introduction of SMARQ, a software-managed alias register queue, designed to overcome these limitations and facilitate more aggressive speculative optimizations.

**Discussion of Itanium:**

The article indirectly mentions Itanium by comparing SMARQ's performance to a "technique with false positives (similar to Itanium)."  While not explicitly naming Itanium, the context clearly implies a critique of Itanium's alias detection mechanism, which is known to be prone to false positives.  This critique is further solidified by the statement that SMARQ "improves performance by 13% compared to a technique with false positives (similar to Itanium)."  This suggests that SMARQ offers a superior solution by mitigating the negative impact of false positives, a weakness inherent in Itanium's architecture.

**Sentiment Score:**

Based on the indirect comparison and the emphasis on overcoming the limitations of Itanium's approach, the article exhibits a **negative sentiment** towards Itanium.

2013-01-01 - Dynamic reduction of voltage margins by leveraging on-chip ECC in itanium II processors

Article:
Lowering supply voltage is one of the most effective approaches for improving the energy efficiency of microprocessors. Unfortunately, technology limitations, such as process variability and circuit aging, are forcing microprocessor designers to add larger voltage guardbands to their chips. This makes supply voltage increasingly difficult to scale with technology. This paper presents a new mechanism for dynamically reducing voltage margins while maintaining the chip operating frequency constant. Unlike previous approaches that rely on special hardware to detect and recover from timing violations caused by low-voltage execution, our solution is firmware-based and does not require additional hardware. Instead, it relies on error correction mechanisms already built into modern processors. The system dynamically reduces voltage margins and uses correctable error reports raised by the hardware to identify the lowest, safe operating voltage. The solution adapts to core-to-core variability by tailoring supply voltage to each core's safe operating level. In addition, it exploits variability in workload vulnerability to low voltage execution. The system was prototyped on an HP Integrity Server that uses Intel's Itanium 9560 processors. Evaluation using SPECjbb2005 and SPEC CPU2000 workloads shows core power savings ranging from 18% to 23%, with minimal performance impact. Copyright 2013 ACM. .

2013-01-01 - Novel on chip-interconnection structures for giga-scale integration VLSI ICS

Article:
Based on the guidelines of International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) Intel has already designed and manufactured the next generation product of the Itanium family containing 1.72 billion transistors. In each new technology due to scaling, individual transistors are becoming smaller and faster, and are dissipating low power. The main challenge with these systems is wiring of these billion transistors since wire length interconnect scaling increases the distributed resistance-capacitance product. In addition, high clock frequencies necessitate reverse scaling of global and semi-global interconnects so that they satisfy the timing constraints. Hence, the performances of future GSI systems will be severely restricted by interconnect performance. It is therefore essential to look at interconnect design techniques that will reduce the impact of interconnect networks on the power, performance and cost of the entire system. In this paper a new routing technique called Wave-Pipelined Multiplexed (WPM) Routing similar to Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) is discussed. This technique is highly useful for the current high density CMOS VLSI ICs. The major advantages of WPM routing technique are flexible, robust, simple to implement, and realized with low area, low power and performance overhead requirements. Copyright  2013 SPIE. .

2014-01-01 - A general model checking framework for various memory consistency models

Article:
Relaxed memory consistency models are common and essential when multiple processes share a single global address space, such as when using multicore CPUs, partitioned global address space languages, and so forth. Programming within these models is difficult and error prone, because of non-intuitive behaviors that could not occur in a sequential memory consistency model. In addition, because the memory consistency models vary from language to language, and CPU to CPU, a program which may work correctly on one system may not work on another. To address the problem, this paper describes a model checking framework in which users are able to check their programs under various memory consistency models. More specifically, our framework provides a base model that exhibits very relaxed behaviors, and users are able to define various consistency models by adding constraints to the base model. This paper also describes a prototype implementation of a model checker based on the proposed framework. We have specified the necessary constraints for three practical existing memory consistency models (UPC, Coarray Fortran, and Itanium). Our model checker verified some example programs correctly, and confirmed the expected differences among the three models.  2014 IEEE. .

Article:
The Private Cloud is a custom-designed cloud computing-like environment within a protected firewall on a closed internal network. In this case, the cloud architecture could be purchased or rented. Boasting tighter security as well as greater reliability, private clouds are quite costly, and thus, resources should be used efficiently. Virtual machines are mostly used to provide a way of sharing resources. This paper deals with the design and deployment of a tool, called Easy Provisioning Manager (EPM). EPM is a platform for a private cloud and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for Itanium Processor infrastructures. It enables administrators to provision virtual machines, in minutes, rather than days. EPM offers a self-service infrastructure portal for autoprovisioning/ deprovisioning and built-in lifecycle management to optimize infrastructure, and it also monitors compute resources for cloud IT.

2015-01-01 - Using ECC Feedback to Guide Voltage Speculation in Low-Voltage Processors

Article:
Low-voltage computing is emerging as a promising energy-efficient solution to power-constrained environments. Unfortunately, low-voltage operation presents significant reliability challenges, including increased sensitivity to static and dynamic variability. To prevent errors, safety guard bands can be added to the supply voltage. While these guard bands are feasible at higher supply voltages, they are prohibitively expensive at low voltages, to the point of negating most of the energy savings. Voltage speculation techniques have been proposed to dynamically reduce voltage margins. Most require additional hardware to be added to the chip to correct or prevent timing errors caused by excessively aggressive speculation. This paper presents a mechanism for safely guiding voltage speculation using direct feedback from ECC-protected cache lines. We conduct extensive testing of an Intel Itanium processor running at low voltages. We find that as voltage margins are reduced, certain ECC-protected cache lines consistently exhibit correctable errors. We propose a hardware mechanism for continuously probing these cache lines to fine tune supply voltage at core granularity within a chip. Moreover, we demonstrate that this mechanism is sufficiently sensitive to detect and adapt to voltage noise caused by fluctuations in chip activity. We evaluate a proof-of-concept implementation of this mechanism in an Itanium-based server. We show that this solution lowers supply voltage by 18% on average, reducing power consumption by an average of 33% while running a mix of benchmark applications.  2014 IEEE. .

## Analyzing the Sentiment Towards Itanium

The article focuses on the challenges and opportunities of low-voltage computing, particularly the need for energy efficiency in power-constrained environments. The authors present a new technique for **dynamically adjusting supply voltage**, aiming to improve energy savings without compromising reliability. 

Here's a breakdown of how the article talks about Itanium:

* **Itanium as a Test Platform:** The article explicitly states that they "conducted extensive testing of an Intel Itanium processor running at low voltages."  This indicates that Itanium is used as a **real-world example** to validate their proposed mechanism. 
* **Itanium's Vulnerability:** The research discovers that under reduced voltage margins, specific ECC-protected cache lines in Itanium consistently exhibit correctable errors. This observation forms the foundation for their proposed feedback mechanism. 
* **Itanium as a Proof-of-Concept:**  The authors evaluate a "proof-of-concept implementation of this mechanism in an Itanium-based server." This further emphasizes that Itanium serves as a **practical testbed** for their solution.

**Overall:** While the article acknowledges the vulnerability of Itanium to voltage fluctuations, it is not presenting Itanium as a failure or a negative example. Instead, it uses Itanium to demonstrate the **potential of their proposed technique** in a real-world context.  The article focuses on the **technical aspects of voltage speculation and error correction** rather than evaluating Itanium's overall performance or capabilities. 

**Sentiment:** [0] - Neutral

Radix page tables as implemented in the x86-64 architecture incur a penalty of four memory references for address trans- lation upon each TLB miss.

Counterintuitively, an ISCA 2010 paper found that radix page tables with PWCs are superior to hashed page tables, yielding up to 5x fewer DRAM accesses per page walk. We challenge this finding and show that it is the result of com- paring against a suboptimal hashed implementation|that of the Itanium architecture. We show that, when carefully optimized, hashed page tables in fact outperform existing PWC-aided x86-64 hardware, shortening benchmark run- Times by 1%{27% and 6%{32% in bare-metal and virtualized setups, without resorting to PWCs. We further show that hashed page tables are inherently more scalable than radix designs and are better suited to accommodate the ever in-creasing memory size; their downside is that they make it more challenging to support such features as superpages.  2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

## Analyzing the Article's Sentiment towards Itanium

The article primarily focuses on **challenging the prevailing belief that radix page tables with page walk caches (PWCs) are superior to hashed page tables**. The authors achieve this by demonstrating that **a carefully optimized hashed page table implementation can outperform current x86-64 hardware, even without using PWCs**. This is done by contrasting their optimized hashed page table design with the Itanium architecture's implementation of hashed page tables, which they consider "suboptimal".

The article **explicitly criticizes the Itanium architecture's hashed page table implementation**. The authors argue that this implementation is suboptimal and leads to inaccurate conclusions about the performance of hashed page tables. They specifically state: "We challenge this finding and show that it is the result of comparing against a suboptimal hashed implementation|that of the Itanium architecture."

Furthermore, the article **highlights the scalability advantages of hashed page tables over radix designs**, suggesting that they are better suited to handle the ever-increasing memory sizes of modern systems. This implicitly contrasts Itanium's design with more modern approaches, reinforcing the idea that Itanium's implementation is not as effective.

**Overall, the article presents a negative view of Itanium's hashed page table implementation.** They use the Itanium as a benchmark to demonstrate the shortcomings of hashed page tables, but ultimately argue that these shortcomings are not inherent to the approach but rather a result of poor implementation.

## Analysis of Article Sentiment towards Itanium

The article focuses on **address translation efficiency in computer systems, particularly comparing different page table implementations**. The authors primarily advocate for hashed page tables as a superior alternative to the radix page tables used in the x86-64 architecture, especially when combined with page walk caches (PWCs).

The article's **main argument** is that hashed page tables outperform radix page tables, even when the latter utilize PWCs. It challenges a previous finding that indicated the superiority of radix page tables with PWCs, claiming that this conclusion was based on comparing against a suboptimal hashed implementation - that of the **Itanium architecture**.

Here's how the article **highlights Itanium**:

* **Negative:** The authors directly criticize the Itanium architecture's hashed page table implementation as "suboptimal," suggesting it's not a good representative of the potential of this approach.
* **Indirectly Negative:**  By highlighting the deficiencies of Itanium's hashed implementation, the article implicitly suggests that Itanium is not a model for efficient memory management.

2017-01-01 - A general model checking framework for various memory consistency models

Article:
Relaxed memory consistency models are common and essential when multiple processes share a single global address space, such as when using multicore CPUs, distributed shared-memory programming languages, and so forth. Programming within these models is difficult and error prone, because of non-intuitive behaviors that could not occur in a strict consistency model. In addition, because the memory consistency models vary from language to language, and CPU to CPU, a program that may work correctly on one system may not work on another. To address the problem, this paper describes a model checking framework in which users are able to check their programs under various memory consistency models. More specifically, our framework provides a base model that exhibits very relaxed behaviors, and users are able to define various consistency models by adding constraints to the base model. This paper also describes McSPIN, a prototype implementation of a model checker based on the proposed framework. McSPIN can take a memory consistency model as an input, as well as a program and a property to be checked. We have specified the necessary constraints for three practical existing memory consistency models (Unified Parallel C, Coarray Fortran, and Itanium). McSPIN verified some example programs correctly, and confirmed the expected differences among the three models.  2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. .

2017-01-01 - VD-IT2, Virtual Disk Cloning on Disk Arrays Using a Type-2 Fuzzy Controller

Article:
Disk arrays provide data storage by combining sets of disks into one or more virtual disks (VDs) utilizing specialized control algorithms. A VD is a partition of such combined storage capacity perceived by the user as a physical disk. VD cloning is a data protection technique that copies the data from one VD to another. A typical problem with VD cloning is that it delays user reads and writes, i.e., increases response times. This paper presents VD- Interval Type 2 (IT2), an effective IT2 fuzzy logic control (IT2 FLC) approach to VD cloning that dramatically reduces the response time delay. The VD-IT2 cloning scheme is capable of balancing two adversely affecting processes: VD cloning and user read/write response times. This IT2 FLC-based approach regulates throughput of VD cloning with regards to the user request activity. The VD-IT2 solves the increased delay in user reads and write during cloning by adjusting the time interval between cloning requests. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, a novel formula for planning of data backups is presented. The data backup formula predicts the fraction of replicated data blocks in a combined (clone and snap) replication. Second, a novel IT2 FLC scheme reduces response time of user reads/writes in half. The VD-IT2 was tested on an Itanium workstation with 120 disks and proved 50% reduction of user latencies within a short period of time (high response time of 60 ms was reduced to half, within 30 s only), on an average basis.  1993-2012 IEEE. .

2018-01-01 - Effects of solution treating on microstructural and mechanical properties of a heavily deformed new biocompatible Ti-Nb-Zr-Fe alloy

Article:
The effects of heavy cold plastic deformation by rolling on microstructural features and mechanical properties of Ti-25Nb-6Zr-1.7Fe (wt %) biocompatible alloy (TNZF) were studied. After a preliminary alloy processing, a heavy plastic deformation by cold-rolling (CR) with a total relative degree of plastic deformation of 90% (equivalent plastic strain,  = 2.42) and a subsequent solution heat treatment (CR+ST) at 900 C for 0.6 ks/water quenching were applied and then investigated. The CR and CR+ST states have microstructures consisting of mixtures of ''-Ti phases and ''-Ti. The alloy in CR state shows a pronounced deformation texture, with highly deformed and elongated -Ti grains, exhibiting internal highly fragmented areas, with shear lines at about 45 and a sub-micron/nanocrystalline fine dispersed ''-Ti phase. The alloy in CR+ST state has completely recrystallized equiaxed polyhedral ''-Ti grains, with average grain size close to 52 m and a sub-micron/nanocrystalline fine dispersed ''-Ti phase. Recorded mechanical properties, for both CR and CR+ST states, show quite similar values for the yield strength (0.2), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and Vickers microhardness (HV0.1) for CR state (0.2 = 603 MPa, UTS = 1282 MPa and 287 HV0.1) in comparison with CR+ST state (0.2 = 598 MPa, UTS = 1256 MPa and 256 HV0.1). Values for the modulus of elasticity (E) are lower (E = 72 GPa for CR state and E = 61 GPa for CR+ST state) than those for conventional biocompatible alloys (E ~ 110 GPa).  2018 by the authors.

2018-01-01 - Timing closure of clock enable signals on a 32 nm Intel Itanium processor

Article:
With modern high speed circuit design using state of the art automated place and route (APR) flows, synthesis of clock enable (CE) signals is becoming increasingly difficult in terms of timing closure. The size of APR blocks in digital physical design in microprocessor projects is expanding with every generation of microprocessors as the implementation tools become more capable of handling large designs with high quality results and fast turnaround times. However, larger APR blocks make CE synthesis progressively difficult as timing closure complexity on these signals increases dramatically. The main problem is due to a single CE register driving the signal to a relatively larger area of the design, and to a greater number of clock gating cells. In this paper, we present automated duplication of CE logic in the APR flow to achieve timing closure on a 32 nm Intel Itanium project. We show how timing convergence is achieved without any additional effort from the physical designers, and with no changes required in the RTL. Solutions to the CE problem with smaller degree of automation and more manual effort, which were used on our previous projects, are also discussed and compared, and the reasons they are deemed inadequate are explained.  2018 Croatian Society MIPRO. .

2020-01-01 - Implications of job loading and scheduling structures on machine memory effectiveness

Article:
The reliable parameter for the determining the effectiveness of processing elements (such as memory and processors) is the number of cycles per instructions (CPI), execution speedups, and frequency. Job loading and scheduling techniques target instructions processing in a manner to support the underlying hardware requirements. One of the earliest methods of scheduling jobs for machines involves arrangements of instruction sets in serial order known as pipelining. Another technique uses the principle of overlapping for instruction sets in order to allow current processing and executions which is introduced in this paper. Again, there is job scheduling technique that requires enlargement of processing elements known as static approach as in the case of Intel Itanium. But, there is a great concern about the most appropriate means of scheduling and loading jobs entirely composed of dependent and branched instructions. The cooperative processing nature of present-day computation has expanded the need to allow users to be involved in multiple problems solving environments. In addition, the paper investigates the implications of these job loading and scheduling approaches on speedup and performance of memory systems. The paper found that overlapping of instruction sets during execution was most effective technique for speedups and memory elements performance. In future works, there is need to focus on parallelism exploitations among diverse machines cooperating in instruction processing and execution.  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020. .

2021-01-01 - Program Obfuscation via ABI Debiasing

Article:
The Itanium ABI is the most popular C++ ABI that defines data structures essential to implement underlying object-oriented concepts in C++. Specifically, name mangling rules, object and VTable layouts, alignment, etc. are all mandated by the ABI. Adherence to the ABI comes with undesirable side effects. While it allows interoperability, past research efforts have shown that it provides robust inference points that an attacker can leverage to reveal sensitive design information through binary reverse engineering. In this work, we aim to reduce the ability of an attacker to successfully reverse engineer a binary. We do this via removal of what we call ABI Bias, i.e., the reverse engineering bias that manifests due to a compiler's adherence to the ABI. Specifically, we identify two types of ABI biases that are central to past reverse engineering works on C++ binaries: VTable ordering bias and Function Pointer bias. We present compiler-based techniques that can correctly and efficiently debias a given binary from the aforementioned biases. We evaluate our proof-of-concept implementation on a corpus of real world programs for binary size, correctness and performance. We report an average increase of 1.42% in binary size compared to the baseline, very low performance overhead and lastly, correct execution of evaluation programs in comparison to the baseline. Finally, we demonstrate efficacy of our approach by hindering DeClassifier, a state-of-the-art C++ reverse engineering framework.  2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

## Sentiment Analysis of the Article:

The article focuses on **reducing the vulnerability of C++ binaries to reverse engineering**. It achieves this by addressing the "ABI Bias" inherent in the Itanium ABI, a set of standards that govern the implementation of C++ features. This bias allows attackers to deduce sensitive information from the binary by exploiting predictable patterns dictated by the ABI.

The article clearly **identifies the Itanium ABI as a source of vulnerability**. It states that adherence to the ABI "provides robust inference points that an attacker can leverage to reveal sensitive design information". This statement is further reinforced by the description of "ABI biases" as "reverse engineering bias" that emerges from the compiler's adherence to the Itanium ABI.

The authors explicitly aim to **reduce the ability of attackers to successfully reverse engineer binaries** by eliminating these biases. This goal is directly achieved by "debiasing" binaries from the predictable patterns dictated by the Itanium ABI.

**Therefore, the sentiment towards Itanium is negative, as it is presented as a source of vulnerability that needs to be addressed for security purposes.**

**Sentiment score: [-1]**  (Signs of critique)
